{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on Suits

22
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,210
不行
It's a no.

23
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,590
我以为你喜欢这个想法
I thought you liked the idea. 

24
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,490
那是在我意识到它只会说点俏皮话和时评之前
That was before I realized that it was nothing but sassy remarks.

25
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,270
我还以为你想让孩子和它的生父
I thought you wanted our baby to have a relationship

26
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,560
能够建立感情
with its biological father. 

27
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,410
但是如果你像今天这么激动的话
If you're gonna get this worked up,

28
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,050
让我觉得我根本不了解你
it makes me think I don't really know you.

29
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,570
要是我能让它更像你呢
What if I could make it more like you?

30
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,040
也许我能让它学到你的心
I might be able to give it the ability to learn from your heart.

31
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,230
你真的觉得这可能吗
You really think we could do that?

32
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,120
我觉得值得一试
We can try.

33
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,210
瑞秋・赞恩有资格成为律师
Rachel Zane deserves to be in the Bar.

34
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,230
你不仅不能阻止她
You're not only gonna stop blocking her,

35
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,770
如果有人阻止她你还要出面干预
you're gonna run interference for her if someone else does.

36
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,380
作为回报  你会做我让你做的事
And in return, you'll do what I want.

37
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,930
不  但我会为了其他事情帮你
No, but I'll do what you want for something else.

38
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,080
我们要对极速数据处理公司
We need to come up with a lawsuit

39
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,980
-提起诉讼  -不
- against Velocity Data Solutions. - No.

40
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,870
不行是什么意思
What do you mean, "No"? 

41
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,340
制造诉讼来操控股价是违法的
Fabricating a lawsuit to manipulate a stock is illegal.

42
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,350
我们找个正当的诉讼理由就不算违法
It's not illegal if we find a legitimate suit.

43
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,660
我们把这差事搞定  恢复你的律师资格
Let's finish the job and get you back to being a lawyer.

44
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,640
"建筑施工需以证明书形式
"Tenants are required to be notified

45
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,020
通知所有租户"
of all construction by certified letter."

46
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,010
你说这算不算证明书
Is this a certified letter or not?

47
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,760
-反对  -这就是那个欺诈律师
- Objection. - Your Honor, this is the fraudulent attorney.

48
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,350
你再在庭上开口就会被逐出法庭
Open your mouth in my courtroom again and you will be removed.

49
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,320
格雷迪先生  你是否要反对
Mr. Grady, do you have an objection or not?

50
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,140
-我不反对  -那法庭别无选择
- I don't. - Then the court has no choice

51
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,570
只能判决有偏见驳回起诉
but to dismiss this case with prejudice.

52
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,940
那个阻止你面试的人
The guy holding up your interview 

53
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,360
想让我们帮他办件事
was trying to get us to do something

54
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,700
因为他以为能威胁到我们
because he thought he could.

55
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,360
-那你要帮他办吗  -要
- Are you going to? - Yes.

56
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,900
-他要  -你说的是我想的那个意思吗
- He is. - Are you saying what I think you're saying?

57
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,970
我答应
I'm in.

58
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,790
好了  瑞秋已经走了
Okay, Rachel's gone.

59
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,840
别唬我
I don't want any bullshit. 

60
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,710
告诉我  不管我们做什么
You're telling me that no matter what we do,

61
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,020
瑞秋都能当成律师
Rachel's getting into the Bar?

62
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,490
我能告诉你  如果她当不成
What I'm telling you is if she doesn't get in,

63
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,100
也绝不会是因为那个混蛋的阻拦
that asshole isn't gonna be the one that stopped her.

64
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,540
好  我答应
Okay. I'm in.

65
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,780
我们要做什么
What do we have to do?

66
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,740
我告诉你了
I told you what we need to do. 

67
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,740
我们得拉低极速数据处理公司的股价
We need to make a dent in Velocity Data's stock.

68
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,080
哈维  这可不是小事
Harvey, that's no joke.

69
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,920
你知道我们得告他们多少钱
You realize how much we're gonna have to sue them for

70
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,180
才会产生这样的影响吧
to make their earnings take a hit?

71
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,320
当然了
You're damn right I do.

72
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,150
他们是家大公司
They're a huge company, 

73
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,440
所以必须得是一记重拳
which means it's got to be something huge.

74
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,670
我都不确定那是否会有关系
I don't even know if that matters.

75
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,810
不管我们告他们什么
No matter what we sue them for,

76
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,760
他们都会想和解的
they're just gonna want to settle.

77
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,590
我知道
I know that. 

78
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,600
所以我们得坚持他们承认有罪
Which means we need to insist on an admission of guilt.

79
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,170
我懂了
I get it.

80
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,200
你要我通过法律诊所来搞
You want me to run this whole thing through the clinic.

81
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,240
只有这样才能看上去合法合理
It's the only way to make it look legitimate.

82
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,670
哈维  我不知道我能不能说服纳森
Harvey, I don't know if I can convince Nathan to do that.

83
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,910
你最好说服他  如果有人发现
Well, you better, because if anyone figures out

84
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,730
我们是为了个人利益
that we're doing this for personal gain,

85
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,220
你就绝对当不成律师了
your chance of getting into the bar is gone.

86
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,310
等等  你还是合唱团的队长
Wait, you were Captain of the Glee Club?

87
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,150
正式职称是中校
The official title is Lieutenant Colonel,

88
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,550
但你不知道也没关系
but that's cool you didn't know that.

89
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,280
天啊  你17岁还戴牙套
Oh, my God. You still had braces at 17.

90
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,050
其实  我28岁又戴过
Actually, I had them again at 28.

91
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,670
这个  你的鼻道
Between this, your nasal passages,

92
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,070
皮肤治疗  还有足部手术
the skin tag epidemic and the foot surgeries,

93
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,820
你做过好多的手术啊
you really had a lot of medical procedures.

94
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,160
塔拉  我知道你在想什么
Tara, I know what you must be thinking

95
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,920
我发誓
and I swear,

96
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,010
我不会把我的毛病遗传给我们的孩子的
I will not pass any of my maladies onto our child.

97
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,680
路易  我没想那个
Louis, I wasn't thinking that,

98
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,060
但你知道生物角度讲
but you do understand that biologically

99
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,140
-这不是你的孩子吧  -当然
- this isn't your child. - Of course I do.

100
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,310
好
Okay.

101
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,560
但我是想  我们至少该要一个自己的孩子
But I was thinking we would have at least one child of our own.

102
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,610
至少
At least?

103
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,740
至少
At least.

104
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,100
你是对的  路易
You were right, Louis.

105
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,920
了解彼此很好玩
Getting to know each other is fun.

106
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,970
你来了  太好了  我需要你帮忙
Good, you're here. I need your help.

107
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,810
是为了法拉盛工人赔偿的事吗
Is this about the worker comp case from Flushing?

108
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,980
不  是为了极速数据处理公司
No, this is about Velocity Data Solutions.

109
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,270
-他们怎么了  -他们不干净
- What about them? - They're a dirty company.

110
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,860
他们多年来干坏事不受惩罚
They've been getting away with shit for years.

111
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,970
我在皮尔逊-斯佩克特工作时一直不能找他们麻烦
I could never go after them when I worked at Pearson Specter

112
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,950
因为我们当时总是站在另一边的
because we were always on the other side of these things,

113
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,150
但我现在可以对他们追责了
but I can go after them now.

114
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,420
迈克  如果这需要我上庭
Mike, if this is going to require me going to court--

115
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,560
不会的
It's not.

116
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,020
奥利佛  我清楚那天发生的事
Look, Oliver, I know what happened the other day.

117
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,760
但你不上庭也可以做个好律师
But you don't have to be a trial lawyer to be a great lawyer.

118
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,780
什么意思
What are you saying? 

119
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,320
我是说  你有其他律师没有的技艺
I'm saying that you have skills that other lawyers don't have

120
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,720
我会马上让你好好使用你的技艺
and I'm gonna put those skills to use right now.

121
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,230
-你需要什么  -那些箱子
- What do you need? - You see those boxes?

122
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,240
那是极速公司这20年来和解的所有案子
That's every case that Velocity has settled in the last 20 years

123
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,960
原告的名字都被封存了
where the names of the plaintiffs have been sealed.

124
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,700
我们得查明他们都是谁
We need to figure out who those people are,

125
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,160
他们收钱保了什么密
what they got paid not to say, 

126
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,880
然后我们要让他们所有人出来作证
and then we need to get every damn one of them to come forward.

127
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,060
迈克  他们把你怎么了
Mike, what did these guys do to you?

128
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,450
他们没把我怎么样  奥利佛
They didn't do anything to me, Oliver.

129
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,670
我就是不喜欢别人认为
I just don't like it when people think 

130
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,550
就因为没人注意
they can get away with anything

131
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,920
他们就可以为所欲为
just because nobody is watching.

132
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,600
-好快啊  -什么好快
- That was fast. - What was fast?

133
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,650
我以为你是来告诉我
Well, I assume you're here to tell me

134
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,020
你针对极速提起了诉讼
you filed suit against Velocity.

135
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,810
我来告诉你的是  克雷格
What I'm here to tell you, Craig,

136
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,850
是迈克・罗斯会处理极速的案子
is Mike Ross is gonna handle Velocity.

137
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,720
那我们就有问题了
Then we have a problem, 

138
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,270
我可不是跟迈克・罗斯做的交易
'cause I didn't cut a deal with Mike Ross.

139
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,200
我是跟你做的交易
I cut a deal with you.

140
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,180
而你是企业法律顾问而我不是
And there's a reason you're an in-house counsel

141
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,110
-是有原因的  -什么意思
- and I'm not. - What are you talking about?

142
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,320
一旦我们丢下我们要丢的炸弹
Once we drop whatever bomb we're gonna drop,

143
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,480
他们肯定想和解  不认罪
they're gonna want to settle without an admission of guilt

144
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,760
大家都知道  我就专门和解
and everyone knows settling is what I do.

145
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,770
所以迈克・罗斯要把这事闹上法庭
So Mike Ross is gonna take this to court?

146
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,950
他都不是个律师
He's not even a goddamn lawyer.

147
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,720
这就对了  克雷格
Welcome to the conversation, Craig.

148
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,890
我就是来说这事
That's what I'm here to talk about.

149
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,990
你要搞定迈克的听证会
You're gonna make Mike's hearing official.

150
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,570
不行  这还太早
I can't do that, it's too soon.

151
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,980
扯淡  你以为我不知道
Bullshit. You think I don't know

152
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,130
你答应迈克的事只是为了让我帮你吗
you only said yes about Mike to get me to help you?

153
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,980
当然了
Of course that's why I said yes.

154
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,080
让他成为律师最难的部分
And the hardest thing about getting him into the Bar

155
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,520
是他没上过法学院  就没法为他安排听证会
is getting him a hearing when he hasn't even gone to law school.

156
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,340
所以你要为他担保
Which is why you're gonna sponsor him

157
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,720
因为他多年在皮尔逊-斯佩克特的工作
based on his years of work at Pearson Specter.

158
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,130
这是念法学
You're talking about reading the law.

159
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,000
没错
You're damn right I am.

160
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,690
这事有先例的  你清楚
There's precedent and you know it.

161
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,290
听着  我可以影响投票结果
Listen to me, I can influence the vote,

162
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,620
但我不能担保我要为他投票的人
but I cannot sponsor someone I'm going to be voting on.

163
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,820
那就找个能担保他的人
Then find someone who will.

164
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,900
你如果不能在下周内为他搞定听证会
Because if you can't get him a hearing in the next week,

165
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,890
这事就没戏了
this thing is off.

166
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,260
还有  克雷格
And one more thing, Craig.

167
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,930
你我不会再交谈了
You and I won't be talking again

168
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,930
因为如果你还没搞明白
because in case you haven't figured it out yet,

169
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,580
这已经比出轨
this is a hell of a lot more serious

170
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,080
要严重多了
than cheating on your wife.

171
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,410
{\an8}诉讼双雄 第六季 第十四集

172
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,390
哈维  你怎么在这儿
Harvey, what are you doing in here?

173
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,690
什么意思  这是高管厨房
What do you mean? It's an executive kitchen.

174
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,520
-我是高管  -对  但你喜欢百吉饼
- I'm an executive. - Yeah, but you're a bagel guy.

175
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,940
这地方是羊角面包中心
This place is like croissant central.

176
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,570
或许我是来
Then maybe I just came in here

177
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,580
跟你共度美好时光的
hoping to spend some quality time with you.

178
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,510
你是说你想听听我跟塔拉度过的一夜吗
Are you saying you want to hear about my night with Tara?

179
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,650
当然
Of course I do.

180
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,360
不如我们先一起做做友谊手链
Right after we make friendship bracelets

181
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,600
然后再互相编编辫子
and braid each other's hair.

182
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,730
知会你一声  那是个神奇的夜晚
For your information, it was a magical evening,

183
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,390
但实际上  我是来谈正事的
but actually, I'm here to talk business.

184
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,140
-什么正事  -时尚定制公司
- What business? - Couture Apparel.

185
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,760
杰西卡和我总是会给他们的总裁做一份
Jessica and I always gave their CEO an annual analysis

186
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,140
来年法律需求的年度分析
of their legal needs for the upcoming year--

187
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,210
现在她走了  所以你想让我和你一起做
And now that she's gone, you want us to do it?

188
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:40,790
没错
Exactly.

189
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,240
感觉是在卖力推销啊
Sounds like a dog and pony show.

190
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,320
不止于此  哈维
It is more than that, Harvey.

191
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,660
这是为了展现实力
It is a show of force.

192
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,770
在那天  我们得让卡莉・唐纳休觉得
For one day, Carly Donahue needs to feel like

193
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,680
自己是我们最重要的客户
the most important client in the portfolio.

194
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,840
只派一位合伙人过去
And having one partner go by himself

195
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,170
不足以传达这个信息
doesn't send that message.

196
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,730
路易  放松  我很乐意去
Lewis, relax. I'm happy to do it.

197
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,540
真的吗
You are?

198
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,560
当然了  告诉过你了  我们是搭档
Of course I am. I told you, we're partners.

199
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,550
你知道吗  哈维  我一直梦想着能像这样
You know, Harvey, I always dreamed it could be like this.

200
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,620
搭档  蓝颜知己  朋友
Partners, confidantes, friends.

201
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,360
我也有同样的梦想  路易
I had the exact same dream, Lewis.

202
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,240
-真的吗  -不  假的
- Really? - No, not really.

203
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,590
意思是不是你永远也不会和我去泡泥浴
Does that mean you're never gonna go mudding with me?

204
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,170
没错  路易  就是这个意思
Yes, Lewis, that's what it means.

205
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,140
我会把会面细节告诉唐娜
I'll give Donna the details on that meeting.

206
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,980
希望你准备好了
Hey, I hope you got a hammer,

207
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,520
我给你带来了些材料
'cause I just brought you some nails.

208
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,290
-你有所发现吗  -是的
- You found something? - Yeah, I did.

209
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,990
我已经找到了六起可利用的案子
I already found six cases we can use,

210
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,450
而那只是冰山一角
and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

211
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,410
所以我们穿好衣服  去狠揍极速一顿吧
So let's grab our coats and go kick Velocity's ass up and down the street.

212
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,460
淡定点  泰森
Easy, Tyson.

213
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,360
你得告诉我这些都是什么类型的诉讼
You have to tell me what kind of suits these are.

214
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,310
都是矿业诉讼
They're mining suits, 

215
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,360
意味着健康问题或是企业疏忽...
which means health problems or corporate negligence--

216
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,440
无论是哪种  造成的危害都很大
Either way, the damages could be through the roof.

217
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,260
奥利佛  做得好
Oliver, this is great.

218
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,590
我知道  虽然...
I know. And...

219
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,290
假如你让我据此在庭上抗辩
if you asked me to make an argument about it in court,

220
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,690
我八成会搞砸
I'd probably shit the bed.

221
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,690
但是  迈克  我告诉你
But, Mike, I'm telling you,

222
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,770
这件事大有文章
there's something here.

223
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,770
我也要告诉你
And I'm telling you, 

224
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,520
也许有一天你能克服你的上庭恐惧症
maybe one day you'll overcome your court stuff,

225
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,150
也许你克服不了
maybe you won't.

226
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,900
无论是哪种
Either way,

227
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,990
这些都足以证明你是个好律师了
this proves that you're a hell of a lawyer.

228
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,820
是啊  谢了  迈克
Yeah, thanks, Mike.

229
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,030
我必须承认
I gotta admit,

230
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,280
发现自己能做到这样让我感觉挺良好的
it feels pretty good to know I can do what I just did.

231
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,650
那你不如去起草诉讼吧
Then why don't you start drafting a suit.

232
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,960
因为等我说服这些人参与进来之后
'Cause after I get these people on board,

233
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,570
我们就要准备起诉了
that's exactly what we're gonna have to do.

234
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,490
唐娜  你绝对猜不到刚刚路易想求我做什么
Donna, you're never gonna believe what Louis just asked me.

235
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,840
让我猜三次
Give me three guesses.

236
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,280
他想成为你  他想看上去和你一样
He wants to be you. He wants to look like you.

237
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,120
他想穿上你这副皮囊
He wants to wear your skin as a body suit.

238
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,050
好吧  你刚刚是不是没开口就说了这堆
Okay, did you just talk without saying anything?

239
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,830
这有什么新鲜的  你整天这么做
What's the big deal? You do it all the time.

240
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,900
说得好  唐娜  你今天如有神助
Good one, Donna. You're on fire today.

241
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,420
好吧  这到底是怎么回事
Okay, what the hell's going on here?

242
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,300
你是说真・唐娜吗
Oh, you mean The Donna?

243
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,850
这只是本杰明和我在合作的一个小产品
It's just a little product that Benjamin and I have been working on.

244
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,680
虽然它还不具备我的情商
It doesn't have my emotional intelligence yet

245
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,420
但我觉得我还是可以拿它来玩玩的
but I thought I'd have a little fun with it in the meantime.

246
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,610
你都有情商了吗
Do you have your emotional intelligence yet?

247
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,920
等它能回这句  那才叫有什么
When it can top that, you might have something.

248
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,710
窝囊废
Loser.

249
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,540
好的  那句话是谁说的
Okay, which one of you said that?

250
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,630
-她说的  -她说的
- She did. - She did.

251
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,790
抱歉  伙计  本店关门了
Sorry, buddy. Grill's shut down.

252
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,490
要到下午五点才开门
We don't open again till five.

253
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,700
没关系  我不是来吃芝士汉堡的
That's okay. I'm not here for a cheeseburger.

254
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,860
我是来谈谈黑泽顿矿业公司的
I'm here to talk about Hazelton Mining Company.

255
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
怎么了
What about it? 

256
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,950
你以工作导致威胁生命的健康问题为由
You filed a complaint alleging life-threatening health problems

257
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,470
提出过控告
resulting from work.

258
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,230
那次控告神秘地消失了
That complaint mysteriously went away

259
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,470
而我希望帮助你获得你应得的赔偿
and I want to help you get the compensation that you deserve.

260
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,890
我不需要一个唯利是图的律师的帮助
I don't need any help from an ambulance chaser.

261
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,110
我不是那种唯利是图的律师  斯塔摩斯先生
I'm not an ambulance chaser, Mr. Stamos.

262
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,120
我叫迈克・罗斯  我在一家法律诊所工作
My name is Mike Ross, I work at a clinic

263
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,310
我们的佣金上限为五万美元
and our commissions are capped at $50,000.

264
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,230
所以我们做这个不是为了钱
So we are not in this for the money.

265
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,620
那是为了什么
Then what are you in it for?

266
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,860
这么说吧  极速公司不是好东西
Let's just say Velocity is bad news.

267
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,120
我很想帮你
Well, I'd like to help,

268
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,220
但即便我想起诉那帮混蛋  我也不能
but even if I wanted to sue those bastards, I can't.

269
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,340
我知道
I know. 

270
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,040
你拿了一笔钱  然后签了保密协议
You took a payout and you signed a non-disclosure agreement.

271
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,390
不是因为这个
That's got nothing to do with it.

272
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,450
他们让我们所有人都签了那玩意
They made us all sign those things.

273
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,670
假如我们中的任何一人违约了
If any one of us breaks it,

274
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,770
那所有人的协议就都无效了
it negates them all.

275
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,060
那就让它们无效啊
Then negate them all.

276
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,880
你说得倒容易
That's easy for you to say.

277
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,280
我快要死了  而死因太长一串了
I'm dying of something with a name so long,

278
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,210
我都没办法说给你听
I can't even tell you what it is.

279
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,990
而你所说的你们佣金的上限
And you're talking about your fee being capped

280
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,610
已经超过了他们付给我的钱
at more money than they paid me.

281
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,660
听我说  假如他们真的只给了你这么点钱
Listen to me, if that's really all they paid you,

282
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,970
而你又真的快死了
and you really are dying, 

283
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,580
我们几秒钟就能解除那些保密协议
we can shatter those NDAs in about five seconds.

284
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,710
你不明白
You don't understand.

285
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,370
我是他们的监工  罗斯先生
I was their supervisor, Mr. Ross.

286
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,290
那些人患病都是我的负责
I was responsible for all those guys that got sick

287
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,840
而正是我同意了只收那么点钱
and I'm the one that got us the money

288
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,880
就签保密协议
that went with those NDAs.

289
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,130
让我猜猜
And let me guess:

290
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
自从你签了协议
ever since you signed them,

291
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,490
你就没睡过一晚上好觉
you haven't had a good night's sleep.

292
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,020
如果你说我说错了  我马上就走
Tell me I'm wrong, I'll leave right now.

293
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,440
需要我做些什么
What do I have to do?

294
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,490
瑞秋  怎么了
Rachel, what are you doing here?

295
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,030
-我能进去吗  -当然
- Can I come in? - Of course.

296
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,740
要喝点什么吗
Can I get you something?

297
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,370
不用了  谢谢
No, I'm good. Thank you.

298
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,140
假如你是来视察你的婚礼场地的
If this is about checking out the place for your wedding,

299
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,720
那还是白天看效果比较好
it might be better during the day.

300
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,150
不  我不是来谈那个的
No, I didn't come to talk about that.

301
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,190
我是来谈这个的
I came here to talk about this.

302
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,140
瑞秋  这真是太棒了
Rachel, this is terrific.

303
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,850
你甚至都不用去面试
You passed the Character and Fitness committee

304
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,320
就通过了品行考核委员会的审核
without even having to go in.

305
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,530
是啊
I know.

306
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,950
那你为何看起来如此忧虑
Then why do you look so concerned?

307
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,740
因为我知道你和迈克为了这个结果所做的事
Because I know what you and Mike are doing to make this happen.

308
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,640
瑞秋  这封信和我和迈克做的事没有任何关系
Rachel, this letter has nothing to do with what we're doing.

309
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,010
这是你应得的  这家伙做的事也是应该的
You deserve this and all this guy is doing is the right thing.

310
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,540
好吧  就算你说得对
Okay, let's say that's true.

311
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,620
那你们俩为了让迈克有同样结果
What about what you two are doing to make

312
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,430
-做的那些事呢  -听我说
- the same thing happen for Mike? - Listen--

313
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,420
不  哈维  你听我说
No, Harvey, I need you to listen.

314
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,080
他刚刚在监狱里呆了几个月
He just spent the past couple months in prison,

315
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,170
而且原本是要呆几年的
and it was supposed to be years.

316
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,970
我绝不能让这种事再发生
And I can't let that happen again.

317
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,270
不会再发生的
It's not going to happen again.

318
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,340
我知道不会  所以我才会来
I know it isn't. Which is why I'm here.

319
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,410
我需要你向我保证如果事情进展的不顺利
I need your word that if things start to go south,

320
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,830
你一定要及时叫停
that you will pull the plug on this whole thing.

321
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,240
-瑞秋  -哈维  我要你保证
- Rachel. - Harvey, I want your word.

322
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,320
我保证
You got it.

323
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,960
如果不顺利  就终止
Thing go south, it's done.

324
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,740
-迈克  你有时间吗  -有  怎么了
- Hey, Mike, you got a second? - Yeah, what's up?

325
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,980
我正要问你呢
I was hoping you could tell me.

326
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,170
很显然奥利佛已经在会议室呆了一天了
Apparently Oliver was in the conference room all day

327
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,510
在处理一件诉极速数据的案子
working on some case against Velocity Data.

328
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,120
是的  我分给他的任务
Uh, yeah, I gave him an assignment.

329
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,930
什么叫你给他的任务
What do you mean you "Gave him an assignment"?

330
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,470
他要处理劳工赔偿的案子
He had the workers comp case.

331
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,920
我帮他处理了
I took care of that.

332
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,850
迈克  你的工作不是产生新案子
Mike, your job isn't to generate cases.

333
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,070
而是针对现有的案子提供咨询
It's to consult on the cases we've already taken.

334
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,600
我知道
I know that, 

335
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,440
但也包括让我们的员工成为更好的律师
but it's also to help our associates become better lawyers.

336
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,990
奥利佛之前在庭上被打击了
Oliver got his ass kicked in court the other day.

337
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,270
我只是在帮他重新建立信心
I'm just helping to build him back up.

338
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,250
我们手上有很多案子
And there are plenty of other cases

339
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,100
都能帮他达到这个目的
you could've used to do that.

340
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,430
但你却跑去签了一个集体诉讼
Instead, you went and you signed a class action,

341
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,100
我们从来不接那些案子
which is something we do not do.

342
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,570
我们为什么不接呢
Well, why isn't it something we do?

343
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,870
这些人正在经历致命的疾病
These men have life-threatening health problems

344
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,490
他们需要一个人来为他们奔走
They need someone to give a shit about them.

345
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,270
我们不接这类案子
It isn't something we do 

346
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,220
是因为我们没有时间和人手
because we don't have the time or the man power 

347
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,010
去扳倒一个像极速那样的巨头
to take on a giant like Velocity.

348
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,070
纳森  我不知道你想听到什么答案
Nathan, I don't know what you want me to say.

349
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,760
我出去走了走  签了这些人  他们也信任我
I went out there, I signed these guys and they trusted me.

350
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,270
我不能现在退出
I can't back out now.

351
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,280
你在皮尔逊-斯佩克特
This the kinda shit you pulled

352
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,690
也会做类似的事吗
when you were at Pearson Specter?

353
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,100
偶尔吧
On occasion.

354
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,510
那我想听到你说下次
Then I want you to say the next time you think

355
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,800
你要做类似的事情之前
to pull something like this,

356
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,200
你至少要出于尊重提前告诉我一声
you have the common courtesy to tell me before you do it.

357
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,370
我建议你泡个热水澡外加一大盒冰淇淋
I suggest a warm bubble bath and a pint of Chunky Monkey.

358
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,000
因为如果你自己都不疼爱自己
Because if you're not good to yourself,

359
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,260
怎么能指望别人对你好呢
how can you expect anyone else to be good to you?

360
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,220
顺便说一句
And for your information, 

361
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,630
程式首选的建议是香草豆和恩雅的专辑
the initial program was vanilla bean and an Enya CD,

362
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,030
但这是跟你学的
but it learned from you.

363
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,430
是不是很棒棒
Pretty awesome, right?

364
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,480
不  本杰明  没有很棒
No, Benjamin, it's not pretty awesome.

365
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,010
你不能讲这些陈词滥调
You can't just give it platitudes.

366
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,030
什么意思
What are you talking about?

367
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,250
感同身受的重点是
The key to having empathy 

368
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,510
让人们感到获得了支持
is making people feel supported in their feelings,

369
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,430
并不只是帮他们解决问题
not just trying to solve their problems.

370
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,990
这是我听过最蠢的说法了
That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

371
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,800
不是的  而且不仅如此
No, it isn't. And not only that,

372
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,330
你还要针对这个人的感受
you have to tailor its response

373
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,940
给出量身定制的答案
to the feelings the person is having.

374
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,300
那要怎么才能做到
How am I supposed to do that?

375
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,710
你必须让它学会聆听
You have to have it listen.

376
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,100
好吧  我懂了
Okay, I get it. 

377
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,510
你是在说它必须要理解用户的感受
You're saying it has to understand the feelings of its user,

378
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,370
然后再用一种同情的方式表达这种理解
and express that understanding in a sympathetic manner.

379
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,860
正是  你觉得你能做到吗
Exactly. Now, you think you can do that?

380
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,730
当然可以  我只需要
Of course I can. All I need to do

381
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,530
让它持续不断地接触目前所没有的东西
is continually expose it to what it's not providing

382
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,340
最终的反馈回路就会
and eventually the feedback loop will show it

383
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,090
告诉他如何变得更像你
how to be more like you.

384
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,770
也就是变得无与伦比
In other words, awesome.

385
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,570
是的  这才是终极目标
Yes, that's the entire point of this exercise.

386
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,740
还要说一句
And for the record,

387
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,090
无与伦比的人不会听恩雅
no one awesome listens to Enya.

388
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,150
好吧  也许确实不会听她的晚期作品
Well maybe not her later work.

389
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,470
你们就一个人吗
You're the whole team?

390
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,740
看起来挺公平  你也只有一个呀
Seems fair. There's only one of you.

391
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,860
我不是律师  罗斯先生
I'm not an attorney, Mr. Ross.

392
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,060
-我是首席执行官  -看来你是来真的
- I'm CEO. - Then you must be serious.

393
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,580
你开个价吧
Why don't you give me a number?

394
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,340
你想听价格  零
You want a number? Zero.

395
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,990
因为我是不会被你这样的人勒索的
'Cause I'm not gonna be shaken down by the likes of you.

396
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,030
这不是勒索  帕默先生
This isn't a shakedown, Mr. Palmer.

397
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,700
那些人因为你们公司知情的情况
Those men are dying from conditions

398
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,270
而正在面临死亡
that your company knew about.

399
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,840
那些人已经签了保密协议
Those men signed non-disclosure agreements.

400
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,260
如果他们不遵守
And if they break them,

401
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,130
我们可以要回所有的钱
we can come after them for every penny they got.

402
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,350
但我有办法让所有协议都无效
And I've got a way to bust every damn one of those agreements.

403
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,060
不可能  那些协议非常严密
No way, those things are airtight.

404
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,130
如果是被迫签订的协议就谈不上严密了
Airtight doesn't apply when signed under duress,

405
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,920
所谓被迫正是指罹患肺癌
which is exactly what dying of lung cancer

406
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,730
但无法支付医药费的情况
and not being able to afford a doctor is.

407
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,250
那祝你好运重复这种申辩一千次
Well good luck making that argument a thousand times,

408
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,950
因为我会尽全力
because I'm gonna fight each and every one of them

409
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,180
-逐一回击的 -这是集体诉讼  你不能这么做
- to my dying breath. - You can't do that,they're a class. -

410
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,010
我可以也一定会
I can and I will.

411
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,930
你再继续纠缠的话
And you move forward with this,

412
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,610
我会用无数的文案工作
I'm gonna bury that shit-hole legal clinic

413
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,980
把你那个可怜的法律诊所埋掉
of yours in so much paperwork, you're going to choke to death.

414
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,340
所以你把我叫来只是为了当面拒绝我
So you just called me down here to tell me no to my face?

415
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,560
我把你叫来是为了告诉你
I called you down here to show you that 

416
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,840
如果你继续这个案子
if you pursue this action,

417
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,040
那些人和你最终都会一无所有
those men are going to beleft with nothing and so are you.

418
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,110
这策略可真不错
That's a hell of a strategy,

419
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,820
那你肯定没有收到我的备忘录
but I guess you didn't get the memo

420
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,050
我的联席律所是皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特
that my co-counsel on this is Pearson Specter Litt.

421
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,860
胡说  他们的名字没有出现在任何文件上
Bullshit. Their name's not on any one of these documents.

422
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,400
因为他们想保持低调
'Cause they wanted to keep a low profile,

423
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,740
但你可以去确认  我也会亲自给他们打电话的
but go ahead, pick up the phone. I'll call them myself.

424
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,110
那我就要和你还有你的大律所在法庭上见了
Then I guess I'll see you and your big law firm in court.

425
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,870
因为正如我所说
Because like I said,

426
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,790
我不会被你这样的人勒索的
I'm not gonna be shaken down by the likes of you.

427
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,100
哈维  我刚接到
Harvey, I just got a phone call

428
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,700
极速公司律师的电话
from the lawyers at Velocity,

429
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,620
他们想确认我们是迈克的联席律师
They wanted me to confirm that we're co-counsel with Mike on this.

430
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,500
那你怎么回答的
What'd you tell them?

431
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,010
你觉得我会怎么回复  我告诉他们没问题
What do you think I told them? I told them yes.

432
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,820
因为如果他们问  说明他在虚张声势
Because if they're asking, he obviously bluffed

433
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,440
我不会放任他不管的
and I'm not gonna hang him out to dry.

434
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,110
你要去哪
Where are you going?

435
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,470
我要去搞清楚他做了什么和为什么这么做
I'm gonna find out what he did and why he did it.

436
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,980
-你到底在搞什么  -冷静  哈维
- What the hell did you do? - Relax, Harvey,

437
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,680
我正准备来告诉你
I was just coming to tell you-- -

438
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,040
不  我明确说过
No, I specifically said 

439
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,900
我不能被别人知道牵扯进了这件事
that I can't be seen to be involved in this thing.

440
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,690
你还说过我们只有一次机会
And you also said we only had one shot at this.

441
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,160
当时我在场和这个人谈的
I was the one in the room with this guy.

442
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,880
-他知道他看透我了  -那又怎样
- He had me and he knew it. - So what?

443
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,450
是你一直说如果我在一场肉搏战中
So you always said that if I'm in a knife fight

444
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,550
处于劣势  那就举起枪
and I'm losing, to pick up a gun.

445
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,890
皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特就是那把枪
And Pearson Specter Litt is a goddamn gun.

446
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,110
我知道这和我们想要的不完全一样
Look, I know this isn't exactly what we wanted,

447
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,230
但我依然可以坚持认罪
but I can still be the one to insist on an admission of guilt,

448
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,470
所以说到底怎么了
so what's really going on here?

449
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,490
我答应瑞秋如果风险太大
I promised Rachel that if this thing got too risky

450
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,890
我就停手  现在风险更进一步了
I'd pull the plug, and it just got a hell of a lot riskier.

451
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,250
这也变得更真实了
Well, it also got real.

452
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,130
那些矿工需要我们
Those miners need us.

453
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,620
我不会抛弃他们的  所以
I'm not going to abandon them, so...

454
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,720
你想干什么
what do you wanna do?

455
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,000
你觉得我想干什么
What do you think I want to do?

456
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
我想好好收拾收拾这家伙
I wanna kick this guy's ass.

457
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,240
那现在的情况是  我有150名矿工入伙
Then here's the situation: I got a 150 miners on board

458
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,310
我还能废除保密协议
and I can bust the NDAs.

459
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,700
但我无法提出集体诉讼
But I can't make the action a class

460
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,870
因为他们已经签字放弃这个权利了
'cause they already signed those rights away.

461
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,940
我懂了
I get it. 

462
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,150
他以为我们不可能把所有案子分开提交法院
He doesn't think we can get all those separate cases to court.

463
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,880
那他又要面临新问题了
Well, he's got another thing coming.

464
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,380
我楼上有十个新律师
I got ten brand-new associates upstairs

465
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,020
在求着要做这种案子
begging to work on a case like this.

466
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,650
你得指导所有人
You're gonna oversee every single one of them

467
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,620
哪怕要一整晚
if it takes all night.

468
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,700
那我一小时以后去你办公室见你
Then I have to meet you at your office in an hour.

469
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,560
我有点事得先去处理好
Something I need to take care of first.

470
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,040
路易  不管你想说什么  都得先等等
Louis, whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait.

471
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,050
不用  我很快就能说完
No, this'll just take a second.

472
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,520
是关于见卡莉・唐纳休的事
It's about the Carly Donahue meeting.

473
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,160
-我在想  -路易  对不起
- I was thinking-- - Louis, I'm sorry,

474
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,820
但我去不了了
but I'm not gonna be able to make it.

475
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,050
-什么  为什么  -迈克有个案子要我帮忙
- What? Why the hell not? - Mike needs my help on a case.

476
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,540
哈维  你可能不想听这个
Harvey, you may not want to accept this,

477
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,990
但是迈克已经不在这里工作了
but Mike doesn't work here anymore.

478
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,080
律所的事是最重要的
and firm business takes priority over--

479
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,390
路易  这次是律所的事
Listen, Louis, this is firm business

480
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,870
而且如果我预想的事发生了
and if what I think is gonna happen happens,

481
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,080
迈克就会回来了
Mike's gonna end up back here when it's done.

482
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,440
-什么  -你还记得
- What? - You remember that thing

483
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,760
我们帮瑞秋解决的那件事吗
that we took care of for Rachel

484
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,250
你说这可能值得一试
that you said might be worth doing?

485
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,580
看来结果确实如此
Well, it turns out it was worth doing.

486
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,210
只不过我是帮迈克做
Only I'm doing it for Mike.

487
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,190
天哪  赛德尔同意帮他了
Holy shit. Seidel agreed to go to bat for him?

488
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,670
是的  这件事搞定后迈克拿到律师资格
Yes, and once it's done  and Mike's in the Bar,

489
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,320
他就能回来工作了
he can come back here and work again.

490
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,720
哈维  这太棒了
Harvey, that is great

491
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,540
没人比我更想看到这个结果了
and nobody wants that more than I do,

492
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,610
-但这只是一次会面  -路易  我知道
- but it's just one meeting. - Louis, I know that,

493
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,530
但三个小时后  我就要连续三天
but in about three hours, I'm gonna be under water

494
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,150
-都无法抽身的  -哈维
- for the next three days. - Harvey--

495
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,880
路易  我知道我说过会和你一起去
Louis, I know I told you I'd be there for you,

496
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,760
但我也需要你支持我
but I need you to be there for me.

497
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,490
好吧  哈维  我会的
Okay, Harvey, I'll do it.

498
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,300
太好了  你还在  收拾好极速公司的文件
Good, you're still here. Box up the Velocity files

499
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,930
-然后在楼下等我  -我们要去哪
- and meet me downstairs. - Where are we going?

500
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,620
皮尔逊-斯佩克特律所同意跟我们合作这个案子
Pearson Specter agreed to partner up on the case.

501
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,160
-天哪  这可是个大事  -想加入吗
- Shit, that's big. - Want in?

502
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,710
当然想  给我十分钟
Hell yeah. Give me ten minutes.

503
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,460
-你  -怎么了
- Hey. - Yeah?

504
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,490
你能告诉我这是什么吗
You wanna tell me what this is?

505
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,100
这是一份合伙代理的协议书
That is an agreement to co-counsel

506
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,930
我正准备告诉你这件事
and I was just gonna come tell you about it.

507
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,970
你准备背着我干多少事
How many times are you gonna make a move without telling me?

508
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,860
纳森  对不起  但我得赶快下手
Nathan, I'm sorry, but I had to move fast.

509
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,880
因为极速公司的人在给我施加压力
The guy at Velocity was putting the screws to me.

510
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,510
这里面有什么见不得人的勾当吗  迈克
Is something shady going on here, Mike?

511
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,050
什么
What?

512
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,780
你先是突然搞来了这么大的案子
First you bring in this huge case out of the blue.

513
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,490
然后眨眼之间又牵扯来了你的老东家
Then all of sudden, you're bringing in your old firm.

514
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,160
是你说我们的资源不足以
You're the one who said we didn't have the resources

515
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,110
解决这种事情
to handle this sort of thing,

516
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,240
所以我才拉来了有能力解决问题的人
so I just brought in someone who would.

517
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,860
没错  我敢说他们也会从中分得一杯羹
Yeah, and I bet they're getting a sweet deal out of it.

518
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,850
不是这样的
It's not like that.

519
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,590
他们收取正常费用的一半
They're taking half their usual fee.

520
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,410
-只要这么多  -那你呢  迈克
- That's all they're getting. - And what about you, Mike?

521
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,340
-你能得到什么好处  -你什么意思
- What are you getting? - What are you talking about?

522
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,470
你敢说你没有把这个案件
You're gonna tell me you're not using this

523
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,300
当做回你老东家的跳板
as a stepping stone to get back to your old firm?

524
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,380
什么  当然没有  纳森  我不想回去
What? No, Nathan, I don't want to go back there.

525
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,500
扯淡  我不相信你
Bullshit. I don't believe you.

526
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,460
这里面肯定有问题  我能感觉得到
Something is going on here and I know it.

527
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,760
你知道吗  纳森
You know what, Nathan?

528
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,940
我告诉你吧  哈维・斯佩克特之前像你一样
For your information, Harvey Specter did offer me

529
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,610
邀请我回去做顾问
a consulting job just like you did,

530
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,540
但他给我的工资是你给的十倍
except his had one more zero at the end of it,

531
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,280
可我还是拒绝他了
and I still turned him down.

532
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,830
是我选择来这里
I chose to be here,

533
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,060
但我不想一到关键时刻就被猜疑
but I don't want to be second-guessed at every turn.

534
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,080
所以你要么相信
So either you're gonna trust that

535
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,010
我是为了你好  要么别信我
my heart is in the right place or you're not.

536
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,400
好吧  那我也告诉你  迈克
Well, for your information, Mike,

537
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,870
我现在也没有别的选择
right now I really don't have a choice.

538
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,410
-你还好吗  -我不好
- Hey, are you okay? - No, I'm not okay.

539
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,310
我到底要怎么才能
How the hell am I supposed to 

540
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,580
单枪匹马保住卡莉・唐纳休的业务
keep Carly Donahue's business all by myself?

541
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,570
路易  你是管理合伙人
Because, Louis, you're co-managing partner 

542
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,640
而且你还是个厉害的律师
and you're one hell of a lawyer.

543
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,500
你不明白  是不是
Oh, you just don't get it, do you?

544
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,610
这个女人想知道自己对我们律所很重要
This woman wants to know that she's special to this firm.

545
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,920
如果只有我一个人去
If I walk in there by myself, 

546
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,080
她会一边嘲笑我一边走出会议室
she's gonna laugh me out of the room.

547
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,290
那你为什么不把这话跟哈维说
Then why didn't you tell that to Harvey?

548
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,320
因为我知道迈克对他的重要性
Because I know how important Mike is to him

549
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,540
我也不想让他失望
and I didn't want to let him down.

550
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,460
-那就别让他失望  -这不是
- Then don't. - That is not--

551
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,100
路易  不只有这一个办法
Louis, if this woman needs to know she's special to us,

552
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,310
能让这个女人知道她对我们的重要性
there's more than one wayto do it

553
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,890
哈维并不是你唯一的选择
and Harvey's not the only one you can bring.

554
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,250
唐娜  你的想法很好  但是会议在明天
Donna, that's great. But this meeting is tomorrow

555
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,040
可我还不了解这些新律师同事
and I don't even know these new associates yet.

556
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,620
你了解的  你了解卡特里娜
Yes, you do. You know Katrina,

557
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,940
她不仅仅是新同事  她还是初级合伙人
who's not just a new associate, she's a Junior Partner

558
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,190
你也了解瑞秋  她和四年律师一样优秀
and you know Rachel, who's as good as a fourth-year.

559
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,700
你到那里显示出这样的力量
You go there with a show of force like that,

560
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,190
相信我  这个女人会折服的
trust me, this woman is gonna be blown away.

561
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,860
好的  唐娜  就显示力量这个方法了
Okay, Donna. Show of force it is.

562
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,850
天啊  奥蒂斯・雷丁的第一张唱片
Holy shit, Otis Redding's first album?

563
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,000
你确定哈维不介意我拿出来吗
You sure Harvey won't mind if I take it out?

564
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,160
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

565
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,270
他不会介意的  他说如果收藏不是供大家看的
No, he says if that collection's not for everyone,

566
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,920
那收藏还有什么意义呢
then what's the point of even having it here?

567
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,990
-听起来像个很棒的人  -最棒的
- Sounds like a great guy. - The best.

568
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,900
甘地在这  哈维在这
Ghandi. Harvey.

569
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,640
-你认真的吗  -向上帝发誓
- You serious? - Hand to God.

570
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,140
他简直就是个圣人
Man's practically a saint.

571
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,240
-发生什么了  -奥利佛  这是哈维・斯佩克特
- What's going on? - Oliver, Harvey Specter.

572
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,710
哈维・斯佩克特  这是奥利佛
Harvey Specter, Oliver.

573
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,140
见到你很高兴  奥利佛
Nice to meet you, Oliver.

574
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,580
要我给你倒一杯吗
Would you like me to pour you a drink?

575
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,720
-真的吗  -当然不是
- Would you? - No, I wouldn't.

576
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,950
现在把那唱片放下  然后滚出我的办公室
Now put that down, get out of my office

577
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,790
如果我再抓到你碰我的任何东西
and if I ever catch you touching one of my things again,

578
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,390
-我就把它塞到你屁股里  -他认真的吗
- I'll shove it up your ass. - Is he serious?

579
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,930
屁股那部分不是认真的
Oh, not about the ass part,

580
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,410
但是如果是我  我会把它放回去的
but I'd put it back.

581
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,260
你玩我
You set me up.

582
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,230
欢迎来到皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所
Welcome to Pearson Specter Litt.

583
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,850
你享受这么玩吗
You enjoy that?

584
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,550
-还不错吧  -很好
- Yeah, it felt okay. - Good. 

585
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,280
现在  你为什么不去确保
Now why don't you go make sure 

586
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,210
每个人都知道他们在做什么呢
everyone knows exactly what they're doing

587
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,790
现在已经晚上9点了  时间不等人
It's 9 p.m., the clock's ticking

588
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,310
我们得把这件事搞定
and we gotta get this thing done.

589
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,180
你准备怎么做
What are you gonna do?

590
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,120
我想一想怎么和
I'm gonna figure out what we're going 

591
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,820
当极速数据处理公司的那混蛋
to say to that Velocity son of a bitch

592
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,720
明天走进来求着签和解协议时  我们应该怎么说
when he walks in here tomorrow begging for a settlement.

593
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,080
你知道这是要干什么吗
Do you have any idea what this is about?

594
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,760
格蕾琴说路易要分配给我们一些特殊的任务
Gretchen said that Louis had some special assignment for us.

595
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,580
我只知道我收到了一条关于那不勒斯冰激凌的
All I know is I got a rambling voicemail

596
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,000
含糊不清的语音留言
about Neapolitan ice cream.

597
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,320
那不勒斯冰激凌
Neapolitan ice cream?

598
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,150
是的  巧克力  香草和草莓的完美混合
Yes. Chocolate and vanilla melded beautifully with strawberry.

599
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,150
就像我们将要为卡莉・唐纳休做的一样
Just like we're about to do for Carly Donahue.

600
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,550
路易  你刚刚是把我叫做巧克力吗
Louis, did you just call me chocolate?

601
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,120
我为什么那样做  你是我的白天鹅
Why would I do that? You're my white swan,

602
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,830
卡特里娜是我的黑天鹅  有那么难明白吗
Katrina's my black swan. The math ain't that hard.

603
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,190
盒子里是什么  路易
What's with the boxes, Louis?

604
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,420
这是律所为时尚定制公司做过的一切
This is everything the firm has ever done for Couture Apparel.

605
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,090
你要带我们去年会
You're taking us to your annual meeting?

606
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,240
我不仅仅是带你们
I'm not just taking you.

607
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,900
-我们要一起做这件事  -好的  路易
- We're running it together. - Okay, Louis--

608
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,760
我知道你们在想什么
I know what you're thinking. 

609
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,160
一个初级合伙人和一个法学院三年级的学生到底
How the hell are a Junior Partner and a third-year law student

610
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,920
是如何填进杰西卡的13号鞋呢
supposed to fill Jessica's size 13s?

611
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,300
答案是  你们不能
Well the answer is: you can't.

612
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,560
-没人可以  -那我们为什么来这
- No one can. - Then why are we here?

613
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,020
因为以前我们常常用等级来迷住卡莉
Because we used to dazzle Carly with rank.

614
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,690
今年  我们准备用事实说话
This year, we're gonna dazzle her with substance.

615
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,150
让她知道我们比其他人更了解她的生意
By knowing her business better than anyone else.

616
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,190
我来搞定生意
I'll take care of the business.

617
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,670
你俩要做的是为她量身定制个
What you two are gonna do is personally tailor

618
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,310
幻灯片展示
the presentation to her.

619
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,900
截至目前  我们还有不到24小时的时间
And as of now, we have less than 24 hours to do that.

620
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,760
-我们不会让你失望的  路易  -我知道你们不会的
- We won't let you down, Louis. - I know you won't.

621
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,440
你觉得杰西卡真的穿13码吗
You think Jessica really wears size 13s?

622
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,130
这也正是我在思考的问题
That's exactly what I was thinking.

623
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,440
奥利佛  怎么样了
Oliver, how's it going?

624
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,860
还好
It's going okay.

625
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,350
我已经起草了6份投诉
I'm finished drafting six complaints.

626
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,070
怎么了
What is it?

627
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,880
没什么  只是我做6份的时间
It's nothing, it's just, in the time I did six,

628
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,440
他们大多数已经做了9份或10份了
most of them did nine or ten.

629
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,410
我猜那意味着你已经到冲刺阶段了
I guess that means you're in the home stretch, huh?

630
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,630
可能吧
Guess I am.

631
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,420
奥利佛  我知道你在想什么
Look, Oliver, I know what you're thinking.

632
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,470
但是我告诉纳森的是实话
But I was telling Nathan the truth.

633
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,570
我没在想办法回来和这些家伙一起工作
I'm not looking to come back here with these guys

634
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,870
并放弃你们
instead of working with you.

635
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,470
我知道你不想回来  迈克
I know you don't wanna come back here, Mike.

636
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,830
我只是想说  这些律师很厉害
I guess I just wanted to say these associates are bad ass,

637
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,310
我很感激你选择和我这样的人一起工作
and I appreciate you choosing to work with someone like me

638
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,360
而不是他们
over them.

639
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,850
你介意我问一下  你是怎么如此确定
You mind if I ask how you're so sure

640
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,200
我不想回到这呢
I don't want to come back here?

641
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,120
因为这些律师都很厉害
Because these associates are amazing lawyers,

642
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,820
但是一整晚没有一个人提到
but not a single one of them mentioned an actual human being

643
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,250
案子中的人
involved in this case the whole night.

644
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,710
他们只想赢
They're just trying to win.

645
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,450
那没有错
And there's nothing wrong with that,

646
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,730
但那不是你的风格
but that's not you.

647
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,250
是的  奥利佛  但那样做是有问题的
Yeah, Oliver, there is something wrong with that.

648
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,310
所以你会成为比他们任何人
And that's why you're gonna be a better lawyer

649
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,920
都更好的律师
than any one of these guys.

650
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,290
我去告诉哈维我们进入冲刺阶段了
I'm gonna go tell Harvey that we're in the home stretch.

651
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,400
-怎么样了  天才  -什么
- How's it going, genius? - What?

652
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,260
我说  怎么样了
I said, how's it going?

653
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,590
我来告诉你怎么样了
I'll tell you how it's going.

654
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,720
-这是行不通的  -什么
- It's not going to work. - What?

655
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,480
-但是我以为你说...  -我不在乎你怎么想
- But I thought that you said-- - I don't care what you thought.

656
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,970
这不是《西部世界》  我不能使她人性化
This isn't "Westworld." I can't make her human.

657
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,900
本杰明  我没有让你把她变得人性化
Benjamin, I'm not asking you to make her human.

658
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,700
我只是希望你给她点同情心
I'm just asking you to give her a little compassion.

659
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,220
我不知道该怎么做
Well I don't know how to do that.

660
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,910
它应该自我学习的  但是它没有
And it's supposed to learn from itself, but it isn't.

661
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,200
怎么了
what's going on?

662
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,430
我一直告诉自己
The story I always told myself was the only reason

663
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,130
我没有在硅谷工作的唯一原因是我不想去
I didn't work in Silicon Valley was that I didn't want to,

664
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,140
但事实是  我没有去那工作的能力
but the truth is, I don't have what it takes.

665
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,770
你走进来  叫我天才
And then you come in here, calling me a genius and--

666
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,790
本杰明  没事的
Benjamin, it's okay.

667
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,470
你只是个普通人
You're only human.

668
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,500
如果行不通的话  那就行不通吧
If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

669
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,240
真的吗
Really?

670
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,570
真的
Really.

671
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,000
此外  如果我不能对你有同情心
Besides, if I can't show you compassion,

672
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,570
那我怎么指望真・唐娜也有同情心呢
how can I ever expect The Donna to show compassion?

673
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,580
谢谢你  唐娜
Thanks Donna.

674
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,520
我很抱歉  我让你失望了
I'm sorry if I got your hopes up.

675
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,000
想好明天我们怎么说了吗
Figure out what we're going to say tomorrow?

676
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,350
你收到那些投诉啦
You get those complaints ready?

677
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,510
你先回答我的问题
I asked you first.

678
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,430
你说得对  但可不是我让
Yeah, but I'm not the one

679
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,490
手下那群我见过的最菜的律师
who had the least experienced lawyer I've ever met

680
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,880
到最后关头才把东西整理好的
put this thing over the goal line.

681
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,840
拜托  我才是你见过的
Come on, I thought I was the least experienced lawyer

682
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,610
最没经验的律师好吧
you've ever met. 

683
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,980
不  你是我见过的最菜的白痴
No, you were the least experienced dickhead I ever met.

684
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,260
-好吧  -因为那个孩子或许没什么经验
- Right. - Because that kid may be green,

685
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,090
但他是你们两个之中
but he's the only one of you two

686
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,810
唯一读过法律专业的
that actually went to law school.

687
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,380
我又不是不知道
Don't I know it.

688
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,260
迈克  你在想什么
Mike, what's on your mind?

689
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,490
没什么  只是在想  我们做的这件事
Nothing. It's just-- this whole thing we're doing

690
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,840
让我对好多人撒谎了  包括奥利弗
is making me lie to a lot of people, including Oliver

691
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,190
然而我并不喜欢对人撒谎
and I'm not thrilled about it.

692
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,520
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

693
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,620
纳森认为这件案子有外部动因
Nathan thinks there's an ulterior motive

694
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,290
而且他猜得不错
to this case and he's right.

695
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,680
奥利弗也发现了  我不得不对他们撒谎
Oliver saw it and I had to lie to them both to cover it up.

696
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,660
或许这是真的
Maybe that's true, 

697
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,880
但是你不能被这些分心了
but you need to keep your eye on the ball.

698
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,780
你是值得获得律师资格的
You deserve to be a lawyer.

699
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,520
而且你也是在帮助那些矿工
You're doing good for those miners

700
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,670
-这些才是最重要的  -我不确定  哈维
- and that's all that matters. - I don't know, Harvey.

701
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,300
你那么关心这孩子的想法是为什么呢
What do you care so much about what this kid thinks anyway?

702
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,370
因为是他让我改变主意
Because he's the reason I decided to change my mind

703
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,750
决定做这件事的
about doing this whole thing.

704
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,010
-什么意思  -他人品很好
- What do you mean? - He's a great kid.

705
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,910
而且他以后也会成为一个好律师
And he's gonna be a great lawyer.

706
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,470
但是我只能眼睁睁地看着他输了案子
But I had to watch him tank a case without being

707
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,930
我没法帮他  而一个女人也因此流落街头
able to help him and a woman ended up out on the street.

708
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,110
我想如果我们做成这个案子的话  
I thought if we do this, then I'll never to have to sit back

709
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,040
我就不用再眼睁睁地
and do nothing when someone I care about

710
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,350
看着我在乎的人输了
is losing ever again.

711
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,750
那么就不要再为我们做的事瞎担心了
Then stop worrying about what we're doing

712
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,100
因为明天我们不会输
because tomorrow isn't about losing.

713
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,980
我们要赢
It's about winning.

714
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,100
太扯了
This is ridiculous.

715
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,350
我们辛苦了一晚上  什么都没找到
We've been up all night and we've got nothing.

716
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,050
-不  我们有收获  -这是什么
- Yes, we do. - What is this?

717
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,090
这是留住卡莉・唐纳休的业务的关键
This is the key to keeping Carly Donahue's business.

718
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,550
三年前和《美食家杂志》的旧访谈
How is a three-year-old interview

719
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,390
怎么可能帮到我们
with "Gourmand Magazine" Going to help us?

720
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,950
因为这说明了她是个吃货
Because it shows she's a foodie.

721
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,310
就和路易说的一样  我们需要让她看到
And like Louis said, we need to show her

722
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,950
我们不仅对她的公司业务了如指掌  还了解她
that we don't only understand her company, we understand her.

723
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,240
我知道了
I get it.

724
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,420
那我们把展示框架
What if we structured the presentation

725
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,990
搭成九道菜品  并给每道菜
like a nine course meal and paired a discrete piece

726
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,730
配上独立的法律分析怎么样
of legal analysis with each course?

727
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,960
就像搭配红酒测试一样
Like a paired wine tasting.

728
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,240
是一对一的红酒测试
Coupled with a paired wine tasting.

729
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,110
等等  难道你也是个吃货么
Hold on, are you a foodie, too?

730
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,390
我是红酒
What I am is a lover of fine wine,

731
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,010
佳肴和芭蕾舞爱好者
delightful cuisine and the ballet.

732
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,590
喜爱程度不分先后
In any order you pick.

733
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,730
边开会边跳舞就算了
Well, I don't think we can have dancers at the meeting.

734
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,430
不伴舞  但要做这个  那除非你懂烹饪
No, we can't. Which means unless you know how to cook,

735
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,040
否则我们得找个世界级大厨
we need to find ourselves a world class chef

736
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,390
而且还要快
and we need to find it fast.

737
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,060
你觉得这个怎么样  迈克和我之前刚刚
What about this: Mike and I just met with

738
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,460
为准备我们的婚礼见了一个世界级法餐大厨
a world class, French-trained chef to cater our wedding.

739
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,420
- 我是说  如果他刚好有时间 -定下他吧
-I mean, if he's available then-- - Book him.

740
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,580
你不想多听我讲讲他的经历
Well don't you wanna hear more about his--

741
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,960
瑞秋  如果我连你的选择都信不过
Rachel, if I can't trust your taste in pairings,

742
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,460
-我还能信谁的呢  -你在说什么
- I can't trust anyone's. - What are you talking about?

743
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,940
我还没有和你道谢过  但是你知道
I never thanked you for this, but you knew

744
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,780
我和你爸爸会很合拍
your father and I would be a great fit.

745
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,870
而且如果不是你想办法让我在被炒后和他见面
And if you hadn't set me up with him after I was fired,

746
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,610
我都不知道我该怎么办
I don't know what I would have done.

747
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,120
我去预定厨师
I'll book the chef.

748
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,830
既然你已经打过电话
I assume from the fact that you called,

749
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,300
那一定拿到我们的圣诞大礼了
you got our Christmas present.

750
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,720
我没找你  我打电话找了哈维・斯佩克特
I didn't call you, I called Harvey Specter.

751
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,600
但他找了我  而我决定要和你聊聊
Well, he called me. And I wanted to come

752
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,540
以防你以为可以背着我
have a little chat with you before you got it into your head

753
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,860
跟哈维搭成协议
that you could go behind my back

754
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,130
而不对错误行为进行承认
and cut a deal without an admission of guilt.

755
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,690
-什么  -听着
- What? - Look, I don't give a shit

756
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,880
我不在乎你提的价格是多少
how much you offered,

757
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,550
你没法花钱让自己抽身
you're not gonna buy your way out of this thing

758
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,320
然后把这件事掩盖下来
without telling the world what you did.

759
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,810
我觉得你不知道和解这两个字意味着什么
I don't think you understand what the word settlement means.

760
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,970
我知道他对你来说意味着什么
I understand what it means to you,

761
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,870
我只是不在乎
I just don't give a shit.

762
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,060
-一个亿  -并公开承认犯错
- One hundred million. - With an admission of guilt.

763
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,420
好啊  合同给我签
Sure, where do I sign?

764
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,520
你听着
Listen to me.

765
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,580
一个亿是这个公司有史以来的最大一笔支出
$100 million is the biggest payout this company's ever made.

766
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,620
不是的  因为我不答应
No, it's not because I'm not taking it.

767
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,600
你有病吗
What is wrong with you?

768
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,900
我可以直接付给你的客户  让他们的生活
I'm willing to cut your clients a check

769
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,260
焕然一新  而你却笨得看不到这点
that'll change their lives and you're too stupid to see it.

770
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,750
我所看到的是  只要案子多拖一天
Here's what I see: Every day this case drags on,

771
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,170
你的股价就多受一天拖累
your stock is gonna take a hit.

772
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,860
而且季度股东大会时
And every quarter when the board meets,

773
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,620
这会是你无法回避的第一个问题
that's gonna be their first question

774
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,950
而且是你最头疼的问题
and your biggest God damn headache.

775
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,360
所以我们真正要解决的问题是
So the real question is are you ready

776
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,720
你到底要不要为你曾经做过的负责
to take responsibility for what you did or not?

777
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,340
我看到你盛装回归大律所
I see you wore your power suit for your return to the majors.

778
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,750
如果你要出席洋基体育场
You gonna play in Yankee Stadium,

779
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,090
你最好穿好制服
you gotta wear the pinstripes.

780
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,190
怎么样了
How'd it go?

781
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,790
挺好的  他简直按着我们的剧本走
Good. He did exactly what we thought he would.

782
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,610
报低价  骂我蠢
Tried to lowball me, called me an idiot

783
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,770
然后把我赶出来
and then kicked me out.

784
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,910
他报价多少
How high did he go?

785
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,010
一个亿
A hundred million.

786
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,750
啥  
What? 

787
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,560
没事  只是我能让他开到两亿
Nothing, it's just I would've gotten him up to two.

788
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,870
是你叫我别还价
And how exactly would you have done that

789
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,010
那还怎么做到呢
when you told me not to counter?

790
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,330
我更能吓住人  我只要出现人就会自动投降
I'm more intimidating. I walk into a room, people cave.

791
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,620
-这是天赐的礼物  -我觉得你离开
- It's a gift. - I think it's a gift

792
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,550
-才是对他们的大礼  -可我给你的大礼
- when you leave the room. - My gift to you

793
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,820
是帮你收拾把我扯进来的
was saving your ass when you screwed the pooch

794
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,620
这个烂摊子
by involving me in this case.

795
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:34,080
我说真的  哈维  我很感激你参与进这件事
Seriously, Harvey, I appreciate you rolling with this thing.

796
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,360
尤其是我还随意发挥了
Especially when I had to improvise.

797
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,400
别担心  事实是
Don't worry about it. The truth is,

798
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,630
我真的很珍惜能够和你再次共事的机会
I like getting the chance to work with you again.

799
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,570
还有  别告诉瑞秋  我喜欢这超额的风险
Besides, don't tell Rachel, I like the added risk.

800
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,600
-我知道  -你怎么知道
- Oh, I know. - How do you know?

801
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,820
因为你告诉我的
'Cause you told me.

802
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,230
"生活高一尺  我却高一丈"
"Life's like this, but I like this."

803
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,700
把我当什么了  卢克・贝里
What am I, Luke Perry?

804
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,520
-有时候  -不过我要走了
- Sometimes. - Look, I gotta go.

805
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,310
因为这个混蛋一个小时后就会
'Cause this asshole's gonna be back in my office in an hour,

806
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,670
来我办公室背着你和我做交易
trying to cut a deal with me behind your back.

807
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,880
天呐
Oh, my God.

808
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,880
-这真是太棒了  -你真这么觉得
- This is amazing. - You really think so?

809
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,840
我知道  这把法律分析与
I know so. It's the perfect legal analysis

810
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,370
报告呈现完美地结合在一起
combined with the perfect presentation.

811
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,100
那你不觉得杰西卡不在这里这件事
So, you don't think the fact that Jessica isn't here--

812
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,140
杰西爱去哪卡去哪卡
Jessica Schmessica.

813
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,980
卡莉一定会大吃一惊的
Carly's gonna be blown away.

814
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,650
我真该现在就给你们俩升职
I should promote you both right now.

815
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,490
-真的吗  -当然不是
- Will you? - No.

816
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,280
-问下无妨  -好了  我们还有些时间
- Worth a try. - Okay, we have some time.

817
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,200
我一个小时后回来这见你们俩
So I'll meet you both back here in an hour.

818
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,730
-你要去哪  -要清清肠胃
- Where are you going? - Gonna go have a prunie.

819
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,610
要为这九道菜腾出地方
Wanna clean out the pipes for the nine course meal.

820
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,550
迈克・罗斯
Mike Ross.

821
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,350
-什么事  -我是克雷格・赛德尔
- Yes? - I'm Craig Seidel.

822
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,130
什么  你来干嘛
What? What are you doing here?

823
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,340
我想知道你到底在搞什么鬼
I wanna know what the hell you're doing.

824
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,190
什么叫我搞什么鬼
What you mean, what am I doing?

825
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,480
我是说你提起150件诉讼  而非一件
I mean, you filed 150 suits, not just one.

826
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,180
詹姆斯・帕默要逐一应战
And James Palmer's gonna fight each one of them.

827
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,940
这意味着这件事会旷日持久
Which means this thing is gonna drag on forever.

828
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,380
只要他一去找哈维
And we're gonna drop the hammer on him

829
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,510
我们就能给他致命一击
as soon as he gets to Harvey's.

830
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,690
我不想再见到你
Now I don't wanna see you again

831
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,510
直到第一次听证会再见到你
until I meet you for the first time at that hearing.

832
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,610
别想就这么走了
Don't you walk away from me.

833
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,130
我雇哈维工作  而他却违背我的意愿
I hired Harvey to do a job, he farmed it out to you

834
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,770
外包给你  你总他妈要听我讲讲
against my will and you're gonna God damn listen to me.

835
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,390
不  你没有雇哈维
No, you didn't hire Harvey.

836
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,900
你之前还给我未婚妻找麻烦
You tried to mess with my fiancée's life and you're lucky

837
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,400
我们没有让你取消律师资格算你走运
we didn't have you disbarred.

838
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,820
所以不要来我工作的地方
So instead of coming to my place of work

839
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,100
骚扰我  你还是滚回你的窝
and harassing me, why don't you go back

840
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,780
等结束了我们会告诉你
to your hole and we'll tell you it's done.

841
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,910
行啊  但你的机会不多了
Okay, but your window's closing.

842
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,290
这事短时间内不会结束
This doesn't get wrapped up soon,

843
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,200
你成为律师的想法可以打住了
your shot at being a lawyer is over.

844
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,200
如果你要求提高诉讼金额
If you're gonna bankroll a suit,

845
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,470
你至少要有胆自己来谈
at least have the balls to negotiate it yourself.

846
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,060
我就当做你对提议不满意
I take it you didn't like the offer.

847
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,630
承认过错可不是提议
Admission of guilt isn't an offer.

848
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,830
那是自杀
It's suicide.

849
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,690
这是迈克・罗斯的案子  他说的算
It's Mike Ross' case, it's his call.

850
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,180
扯淡  迈克・罗斯就是个法律诊所员工
Bullshit. Mike Ross is some clinic worker.

851
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,990
你是哈维・斯佩克特  而据我所知
You're Harvey Specter. And from what I hear about you,

852
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,630
你根本就不关心过错
you don't give a shit about guilt.

853
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,950
没错  我是不关心
You're right, I don't.

854
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,080
那你就告诉我多少钱
So why don't you tell me how much

855
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,190
-能摆平这件事  -五亿
- it's gonna take to make this go away. - 500 million.

856
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,780
乘2就十亿了  你疯了吧
Half a billion dollars? Are you insane?

857
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,730
你毒害自己的雇员  帕默先生
You poisoned your employees, Mr. Palmer.

858
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,150
你没在监狱都算幸运的
You're lucky you're not in prison.

859
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,590
-两亿  -不行
- 200 million. - No.

860
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,000
-三亿  -不行
- 300 - No.

861
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,030
这样吧  三点五亿收工
Okay, make it 350 and call it a day.

862
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,780
五亿  一个子儿都不能少
500. Not a penny less.

863
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,300
这样的话就不谈了
In that case, make it zero

864
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,490
因为你刚证实了我今早就开始怀疑的事情
because you just confirmed what I suspected since this morning.

865
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,500
你挑一个这么确切的数字好让我的股价暴跌
You picked the exact number to make my stock take a nosedive

866
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,670
我们都知道谁会受益
and we both know who benefits from that.

867
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,150
克雷格・赛德尔
Craig Seidel.

868
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,430
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

869
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,320
那我猜你也不知道迈克・罗斯
Then I guess you also don't know that Mike Ross

870
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,980
刚和道德委员会达成约定
just got an appointment with the ethics board

871
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,300
这样这笔交易就是违法的
and it's a crime to trade this for that.

872
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,570
这意味着你的诉讼也结束了
Which means your lawsuit is over.

873
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,650
那我就做点别的
Then I'll do something else.

874
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,750
你认为你偷了赛德尔公司的技术
You think I won't go after you

875
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,250
我不能追究你盗窃吗
for stealing technology from Seidel's company?

876
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,990
你证明不了我做过什么
You have no proof I did anything.

877
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,140
我证明不了但他可以
No, but he does

878
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,770
我才不在乎他的婚姻
and I don't give a shit about his marriage,

879
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,150
而且我会让他出面作证
and I'm going to make him come forward.

880
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,170
他的婚姻
His marriage?

881
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,790
他告诉你他是在顾忌这个
Is that what he told you this is about?

882
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,090
我倒是有些消息给你  斯佩克特先生
Well, I've got news for you, Mr. Specter,

883
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,510
他不肯出面
the reason he hasn't come forward

884
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,490
根本不是因为他的婚姻
has nothing to do with his marriage.

885
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,360
那你去查查他到底为什么不愿出面
So, why don't you go find out what's what.

886
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,880
我有种预感等你查到
And I got a feeling when you do,

887
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,120
就会立刻撤销这件案子
you'll drop this case by the morning.

888
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,960
-你好  -你好
- Hey. - Hey.

889
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,280
你逃离展示的速度太快
You ran out of the presentation so quickly,

890
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,540
我都没来得及问你的想法
I didn't get to ask what you thought.

891
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,230
我要去上课  但我觉得进行的很顺利
I had to get to class, but I thought it went great.

892
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,150
-路易呢  -他开心死了 
- What about Louis? - He was over the Moon.

893
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,170
我相信你回来他会很高兴的
I'm sure he's glad to have you back.

894
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,940
我也很高兴回来
I'm glad to be back.

895
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,350
-我应该  -跟我爸一起工作感觉怎么样
- Well, I should, uh-- - What was it like working with my dad?

896
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,850
你说这个搭配非常棒而我想知道
You said it was a great pairing and I was just wondering--

897
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:36,220
-你错过了什么  -是的
- What you were missing. - Yes.

898
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,970
你错过了一个十分智慧
You were missing a brilliant,

899
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,570
不知疲倦  可爱迷人而又风趣幽默的男人
tireless, sweet, funny, charming man.

900
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,230
他也是我见过最棒的诉讼律师
who may also be the best litigator I've ever seen.

901
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,590
也许你没明白我的问题
Maybe you didn't understand my question.

902
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,180
我是问和我爸赞恩一起工作的感觉
I was asking what it was like to work with Zane,

903
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,410
-不是他的合伙人卡尔多  -瑞秋  我认真的
- not Kaldor. - Rachel, I'm serious.

904
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,790
我在那的时候跟你爸爸学到了很多
I learned a lot about your father while I was there

905
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,430
我要告诉你  一切都很棒
and I'm telling you, it was all good.

906
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,900
那他的脾气呢
What about his temper?

907
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,040
好吧  也许不是一切都好
Well, maybe it wasn't all good.

908
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,280
晚上愉快
Well, good night.

909
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,340
我还知道他一件事
One more thing I learned about him.

910
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,160
他不止爱你  他尊敬你
He doesn't just love you, he respects you.

911
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,830
-你怎么知道  -他向你提供工作的时候
- How would you know that-- - When he offered you that job,

912
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,180
他喜气洋洋
he was beaming.

913
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,530
他跟办公室里的每个人说他聪明的宝贝女儿
He told everyone in the office that his brilliant baby girl

914
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,030
就要跟他一起工作了
was gonna work for us and she was gonna

915
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,980
而她会击败我们所有人
blow us all to smithereens.

916
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,720
-他这么说的  -瑞秋  我没有告诉你
- He said that? - Rachel, I didn't tell you that

917
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,980
是不想你伤心
to make you feel bad.

918
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,210
你虽然没接受他的邀请  他也能承受
He was okay that you didn't take his offer.

919
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,380
这没有让我伤心
It doesn't make me feel bad.

920
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,940
而让我感觉更好
It makes me feel great.

921
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,990
-他在吗  -不在  他有事走了
- Is he in? - No, he had to run out.

922
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,730
那行  你帮我个忙
All right, do me a favor,

923
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,650
他回来后告诉他我得找他谈谈
just tell him I need to talk to him when he gets back.

924
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,480
你介意我问一下什么事吗
You mind if I ask what it's about?

925
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,880
我刚和卡莉・唐纳休通过电话
I just got off the phone with Carly Donahue.

926
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,850
路易  怎么了  瑞秋说挺顺利的
Louis, what happened? Rachel said that it went great.

927
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,400
我之前也这么想  但后来她给我打电话
I thought it did, too, but then she called me

928
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,040
说如果下次她想跟我和哈维
and said that the next time she asks for a meeting

929
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,730
见面  她最好能跟我和哈维见面
with me and Harvey, she better get a goddamn meeting

930
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,900
而不是派两只虾兵蟹将
with me and Harvey instead of two nobodies.

931
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,130
-你怎么跟她说的  -我告诉她你怎么敢
- What did you tell her? - I told her how dare she

932
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,460
这么说我两个心头宝
talk about my superstars like that.

933
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,580
能遇到她们是她的荣幸
She's lucky to have them.

934
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,920
路易  说得真好  你真棒
Louis, that's great. Good for you.

935
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,160
她把我们解雇了  唐娜
She fired us, Donna.

936
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,760
路易  我很抱歉  听着  这不是你的错
Oh, Louis, I'm so sorry. Look, this isn't your fault.

937
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,210
-你又想不到  -没事
- You couldn't have known. - It's okay.

938
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,180
我得回家去了
I just need to go home.

939
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,610
该死
Shit.

940
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,570
没事的  唐娜
It's okay, Donna.

941
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,790
-这也不是你的错  -不  这是我的错
- It's not your fault, either. - Yes, it is.

942
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,700
我可是唐娜  我应该想到的
I'm Donna, I should have known.

943
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,340
或许吧  但你总说
Maybe, but you always say

944
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,650
是人都会出乱子
part of being human is messing up sometimes

945
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,600
你也许是唐娜  但你也是人
and you may be Donna, but you're still human.

946
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,740
该死
Holy shit.

947
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,710
你蓄势待发了
You are ready.

948
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,610
奥利佛
Oliver.

949
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,540
你来这儿有什么事
Hey, what are you doing here?

950
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,740
我想知道我之前是否看错你了
I want to know if I was wrong about you.

951
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,100
-你在说什么  -我想知道
- What are you talking about? - I wanna know

952
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,560
你是否利用此案想重回皮尔逊-斯佩克特律所
if you're using this case to get back to Pearson Specter.

953
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,160
奥利佛  我们谈过此事
Oliver, we talked about this.

954
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,750
我以为你了解我不是那样的人
I thought you understood that's not who I am.

955
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,690
我也这么认为  但后来我一想
I thought so, too, but then I got to thinking.

956
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,390
你这么长时间把好多人骗得团团转
You fooled so many people for so long.

957
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,770
如果你现在也在骗我呢
What if you're fooling me now?

958
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,090
因为你告诉我你还在皮尔逊-斯佩克特律所时
Because you said Pearson Specter would never take on

959
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,600
他们绝不会接这种案子
a case like this when you were there before.

960
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,410
没错  因为他们绝不想在一场公司诉讼中
Yeah, because they never wanted to be on the wrong side

961
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,510
站错了队
of a corporate lawsuit.

962
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,100
那现在他们为什么选择错的一队
Then why are they on the wrong side of one now?

963
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,210
-奥利佛  -拜托  别骗我  迈克
- Oliver-- - Please, don't lie to me, Mike.

964
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,890
跟我说实话
Just tell me what's going on.

965
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:43,050
说来话长  但我们接这个案子
It's a long story, but we brought the suit

966
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,540
这样我就能进律师协会
so that i could get into the Bar.

967
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,100
所以你骗了纳森  只不过不是他想的那样
So you were lying to Nathan, only not about what he thought.

968
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,720
-听我说  -我不听
- Listen to me-- - I'm not gonna listen

969
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,130
你得告诉他到底发生了什么
and you need to tell him what's going on.

970
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,180
我不能这么做  我说我不会
I can't do that and I wasn't lying to him

971
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,410
重回之前的律所  我没有骗他
when I said I'm not going back to my old firm.

972
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,610
我说我很重视这些人的生活
I wasn't lying to him when I said

973
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:56,970
我也没有说谎
these people's lives matter to me

974
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,130
我说我在意你会成为一名怎样的律师
and I wasn't lying to either one of you when I said

975
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,200
我也没骗你们任何一个人
I care about what kind of lawyer you're gonna be.

976
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,190
如果你在意我会成为怎样一名律师
Well, if you care what kind of lawyer I'm going to be,

977
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,870
那就做个好榜样
set the right example

978
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,490
因为纳森需要知道事情的真相
because you owe it to Nathan to tell him the truth.

979
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,340
-你好  -你好
- Hi. - Hey.

980
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,400
-这是什么
- What's this?

981
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,260
这是我所有的年鉴
It's every yearbook I've ever had.

982
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,380
那晚我们一起看你的年鉴真的很温馨
It was so nice doing it with yours the other night

983
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,930
我想今晚我们可以一起来看我的
I thought maybe tonight we could do it with mine.

984
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,890
路易  怎么了
Louis, what's wrong?

985
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,020
没什么  今天  有点不顺
Nothing's wrong. I, uh--had a bad day

986
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,230
我想和你谈谈此事
and I wanted to talk to you about it.

987
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,190
但你费事做了这些
But you went to all this trouble

988
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,500
我不想来烦你
and I don't want to bring you down.

989
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,100
路易  我的年鉴又跑不了
Louis, my yearbooks are always gonna be here.

990
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,030
而且聊聊对你来说很重要的工作
And hearing about something as important to you as your work

991
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,410
不会烦到我的
isn't going to bring me down.

992
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,070
这只会让我们更亲密
It's going to bring us closer.

993
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,790
你确定吗  因为我好多天都不好过
Are you sure because I have a lot of bad days at work.

994
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,170
这就更有理由这么做了
Which is all the more reason

995
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,970
你需要回家后能有人让你舒服些
for you to have someone to make you feel better at home.

996
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,110
好吧  但说起来有点长
Okay, but it's kind of a long story.

997
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,450
那你先坐好  我给你拿杯喝的
Well then you sit right here, I'll go make you a drink

998
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,050
然后你就能对我一诉衷肠
and then you can tell me all about it.

999
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,860
你知道我想喝什么吗
You know what I'm in the mood for?

1000
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,780
我还说不上  但我确定荷产桃味杜松子酒和
I can't tell which one yet, but I'm pretty sure its either

1001
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,810
上好的冷梅酒  两者选其一
a Peach Schnapps or a nice, cold Prunie.

1002
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,590
你真的越来越懂我了  对吗
You really are getting to know me, aren't you?

1003
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,680
那当然
I sure am.

1004
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,420
我的天  你来这儿干嘛
Jesus Christ. What are you doing here?

1005
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,460
你们不是告诉我要离你远点
You guys told me to stay away from you.

1006
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,000
没错  那是在我和你的伙计
Yeah, that was before I had a chat

1007
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,540
詹姆斯・帕默谈过之前
with your buddy James Palmer.

1008
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,730
听着  我不认识什么詹姆斯・帕默
Look, I don't even know James Palmer,

1009
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,520
-所以不管他说了什么  -他不用说什么
- so whatever he said-- - He didn't have to say anything,

1010
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,040
他只要指一指就好
all he had to do was point.

1011
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,030
那又怎样  一个用我名字注册的离岸账户
So what? This is an off-shore account in my name.

1012
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,620
一个存了三十万美金的离岸账户
An off-shore account with $300,000 in it,

1013
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,170
正好发生在所谓的极速公司

你不是因为你结婚了才想低调处理此事
And you didn't have to keep this quiet because you're married.

你是因为牵涉其中才这么做
You kept it quiet because you're in on it.

1019

We need to keep this suit going and get that technology back.

1026
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,350

Nuh-uh, buddy.

1027
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,430
你根本不在乎你的员工
You don't give a shit about your employees

1028
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,860
我也根本不在乎你

所以你不仅要给迈克安排面试
So you're not just getting Mike an interview,

1033
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,420
如果你不这么做  你老板就会
