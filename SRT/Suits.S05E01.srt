你是我见过的最出色的女人
You're the most amazing woman I have ever met.

16
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,430
你是在做我认为你在做的那件事吗
Are you doing what I think you're doing?

17
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,340
瑞秋・伊丽莎白・赞恩

00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,840
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

19
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,590
-愿意  -愿意吗
- Yes. - Yes?

20
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,760
你想把迈克从我身边夺走
You want my permission to take Mike

21
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,450
然后强迫他做你的助理
and force him to be your associate.

22
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,740
要么现在说  要么永远别出声
Speak now, or forever hold your peace.

23
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,580
我给咱俩弄了点东西
I got us something.

24
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,020
正好配我们的完美联手
The perfect way to consummate our relationship.

25
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,240
-等我一下  我去厨房拿  -好的
- So just wait right here. It's in the kitchen. - Sure.

26
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,760
我可不能放任你这么做
I can't let you do this.

27
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,770
你只是回到你本来的家
You're going back where you belong.

28
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,990
你从来不关心我
You never cared about me.

29
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,480
你只关心你自己
All you care about is yourself.

30
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,090
路易  我不是诺玛
Louis, I'm not Norma.

31
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,330
我说过不会让你出事
I told you I'd never let anything happen to you,

32
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,720
就绝对会遵守诺言
and I won't ever.

33
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,980
我该走了
I should go.

34
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,890
为什么
Why?

35
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,600
你知道我爱你  唐娜
You know I love you, Donna.

36
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,000
在你告诉我你爱我之后就跑掉了
You ran away, but not before you told me you loved me.

37
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,940
我之所以那么说是为了让你好受点
I did that because I wanted to make you feel better.

38
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,200
我不需要你的怜悯
I don't want your pity.

39
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,530
你得开始想着找新秘书了
You need to start thinking about a new secretary.

40
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,440
哈维根本不知道拥有你是多幸运的一件事
Harvey has no idea how lucky he is to have you.

41
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,840
我要离开你了  哈维
I'm leaving you, Harvey.

42
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,080
不能就这样辞职
You can't just quit.

43
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,410
我不是要辞职
I'm not quitting.

44
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,540
我要去为路易工作
I'm going to work for Louis.

45
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,770
我告诉他  律师费的事我可以让步
So I told him I'll cave on the billables,

46
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,570
但如果他要个成天巴结他的人
but if he wants someone to kiss his ass all day,

47
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,110
他得去找路易
he'll have to settle for Louis.

48
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,570
那他怎么说
And what did he say?

49
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,270
不知道  但我们拿到了钱
I don't know, but we got paid

50
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,930
他一周也没来烦我了
and I haven't heard from him in a week.

51
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,240
我得说  哈维  总体看来
I have to say Harvey, all things considered,

52
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,870
你对唐娜去为路易工作这件事还挺豁达的
you're taking this whole Donna-Louis thing in stride.

53
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,530
我虽然也有困难  但那只会让我更坚强
Well, I may have my issues, but they only make me stronger.

54
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,030
很好  因为我们马上要走进一间
Good, because we're about to walk into a room

55
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,050
坐满自以为掐着我们命脉的人的屋子了
packed with people who think they've got us by the balls.

56
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,260
我才不管他们怎么想呢
Well, I don't care what they think,

57
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,860
我一定会大杀四方
cause I'm gonna kill it.

58
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,890
怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

59
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,140
情况就是  我给你留了五通留言
What's going on is I left you five messages

60
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,460
你却没回话
and you never called me back.

61
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,790
会议一小时前就结束了  而你们不在
The meeting was over an hour ago and you weren't here.

62
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,010
五通留言
Five messages?

63
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,930
请你理解  我的秘书走了
Please, you have to understand, I lost my secretary.

64
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,600
我才不管  我的公司都丢了
I don't give a shit. I lost my company.

65
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,460
不  还没有
No, you haven't.

66
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,580
我们能拿回来的
We can get them back.

67
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,680
我可以解决
I can take care of it.

68
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,750
扯淡
Bullshit.

69
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,580
你连自己的事都解决不了
You can't even take care of yourself.

70
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,860
抱歉  哈维  你只能靠自己了
Sorry, Harvey. You're on your own.

71
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,610
然后呢
And then what happens?

72
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,660
然后我醒了
And then I get up.

73
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,690
你醒来之后是什么感觉
And how do you feel when you get up?

74
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,590
我说了  我不想谈感受
I told you I don't wanna talk about how I feel.

75
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,640
那你为什么来呢
Then what are you doing here?

76
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,920
这你清楚
You know what I'm doing here.

77
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,180
我说了  你要想治好失眠
I told you, your sleepless nights aren't going to stop

78
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,230
就必须接受
until you accept the fact that your secretary

79
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,150
你的秘书不会再回来这个事实
isn't coming back.

80
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,140
我也说了  等她回来了  我就不会再失眠了
And I told you they'll stop when she does.

81
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,550
再给我写个处方
So just write me another prescription

82
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,270
让我在那之前能睡个安稳觉
and let me get some sleep in the meantime.

83
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,510
那样是不行的
It doesn't work that way.

84
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,560
那要怎么才行
Then how does it work?

85
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,920
你先跟我说说
Why don't we start with you taking me

86
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,170
到底怎么回事吧
through the whole story again?

87
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,800
那有什么用
What the hell good is that gonna do?

88
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,950
你想听真话吗
You want the truth?

89
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,270
我觉得你可能有所隐瞒
I think you might have left some things out.

90
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,800
我没有  我也不会
Well, I didn't, and I'm not about to

91
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,320
再回顾那点烂事了
go through this whole damn thing again.

92
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,850
那就另找个医生吧
Then go and find yourself another doctor.

93
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,690
你不跟我开口  我是不会
Because I'm not writing a prescription for anything

94
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,930
给你写处方的
without you talking to me.

95
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,460
{\an8}六周前

96
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,030
我就是忍不住不盯着它看
I...I can't stop staring at it.

97
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,270
我发现了
Oh, I noticed.

98
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,730
嗯  其他人也会发现的
Yeah. So will everyone else.

99
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,810
是啊  要的不就这效果吗
Well, I mean, yeah, that's the point.

100
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,540
让大家知道你属于我了
For everyone to realize that you're my property.

101
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,640
好吧
Okay.

102
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,990
我现在归你了吗
Are you saying you own me now?

103
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,230
当然  这个
Oh, hell yeah, and this here

104
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,790
就是你手指的项圈
is just like a little collar for your finger.

105
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
迈克  说真的
Mike, seriously...

106
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,370
我们昨晚告诉我父母了
I know we told my parents last night,

107
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,540
但我在考虑  律所方面
but I was thinking that, in terms of work,

108
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,930
或许我们暂时还是别说出去
maybe we should keep it to ourselves for a bit.

109
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,090
我明白
I understand.

110
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,010
-真的  -嗯
- You do? - Sure.

111
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,570
我们身边像是有一个泡泡
You know, it's like there's this bubble around us,

112
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,030
你暂时还不想戳破
and you just don't want it to burst yet.

113
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,280
你不介意吗
And you're okay with that?

114
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,630
瑞秋  你刚刚答应跟我共度余生
Rachel, you just agreed to spend the rest of your life with me.

115
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,610
现在  我什么都不介意
Right now I'm pretty okay with everything.

116
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,950
那就说定了
Then it's settled.

117
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,620
我们就只告诉唐娜
We'll tell Donna and that's it.

118
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,640
什么
What?

119
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,840
那个泡泡呢  唐娜不在泡泡里啊
What about the bubble? There's no Donna in the bubble.

120
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,590
得了  唐娜当然在泡泡里
Come on, there's room for Donna in the bubble.

121
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,630
你知道我可以
You realize I get to sleep with

122
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,860
跟泡泡里的人上床吧
whoever's in the bubble, right?

123
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,020
你知道我爸爸也在泡泡里吧
So long as you realize that my dad's in the bubble.

124
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,400
那就告诉唐娜
Donna it is.

125
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,180
过来  好了
Come here. All right.

126
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,700
记得网上那个吗
Remember that thing online?

127
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,830
我们要实行一下
We're doing it.

128
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,990
唐娜  你干什么呢
Donna, what the hell are you doing?

129
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,170
你觉得呢
What does it look like I'm doing?

130
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,870
丢掉这些简历
I'm getting rid of these résumés.

131
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,200
天呐  女人  你疯了吗
No, no. Oh, my God, woman, are you crazy?

132
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,810
我十分钟后要见诺玛的接替者
I have interviews with Norma's replacements in ten minutes.

133
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,330
这要麻烦了  因为
Oh, that's gonna be hard considering the fact

134
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,010
我取消了你所有的会面
that I canceled all your interviews.

135
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,570
该死的  唐娜
Damn it, Donna,

136
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,910
那都是本市最佳的应聘者
those were the best candidates in the city.

137
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,390
不  路易  本市最佳的应聘者
No, Louis, the best candidate in the city

138
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,290
就站在你面前
is standing right in front of you.

139
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,670
但你拒绝我了啊
But you told me no.

140
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,050
现在我答应你了
And now I'm saying yes.

141
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,660
这是我这辈子最棒的时刻
This is the most amazing moment in my entire life.

142
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,830
很好
Good.

143
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,670
这两周我会给你找个临时工
I'll get you a temp for a couple of weeks

144
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,820
然后我们就正式开始
and then we'll get started.

145
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,700
等等  对不起  等等
Wait, I'm sorry, wait.

146
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,330
你还没告诉哈维吗
You haven't told Harvey yet?

147
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,880
我告诉他了  但我得给他两周时间
I told him. I just-- I have to give him two weeks.

148
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,990
好吧  你知道吗  我又想了一下
Okay, you know what, on second thought,

149
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,310
虽然我非常感激你的好意
as much as I appreciate the gesture,

150
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,780
我认为你还是应该和哈维在一起
I think you should just stay with Harvey.

151
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,300
你说什么呢  这不是什么好意
What are you talking about? This isn't a gesture.

152
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,390
不  听着
No, look, you just--

153
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,200
你记得之前迈克差点成为我的助理律师吗
Do you remember Mike almost became my associate?

154
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,320
我说什么呢  你当然记得
What am I talking about? Of course you do.

155
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,710
那你一定也记得
Well then, you'll also remember that

156
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,440
迈克刚刚答应了我
just as Mike had said yes,

157
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,680
哈维就搅了进来
Harvey swoops in

158
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,680
在最后一秒钟把他抢了回去
and he takes him back from me at the last second.

159
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,740
不会发生那种事的
That isn't gonna happen.

160
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,180
你不知道的是我离开了办公室
What you don't know is that I left the room.

161
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,770
我去给迈克拿了个蛋糕
I went to get Mike this cake that said,

162
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,300
上面写着"欢迎来到利特团队"
"Welcome to Team Litt."

163
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
等我两分钟后回来的时候
Two minutes later, I come back and there they are,

164
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,940
他们两个就在击掌  欢笑  然后一起走了
high-fiving, laughing, and then they leave.

165
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,220
我就把蛋糕扔了
I threw the cake out.

166
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,860
我不能接受你再做一次那样的事
I cannot have that happen again with you.

167
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,710
路易  我说了不会再发生那种事了
Louis, I told you that isn't gonna happen.

168
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,160
你没听到我的话吗
Did you not just hear me?

169
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,890
哈维只用了两分钟就把迈克抢回去了
It took Harvey two minutes to steal Mike back from me.

170
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,860
在你这儿  他有两周时间
With you, he has two weeks.

171
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,410
所以还是不用了
So no thank you.

172
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,220
唐娜  我需要在午餐之前联系上亨德森
Donna, I need to get in touch with Henderson before lunch,

173
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,270
我还要给布拉克斯顿准备一瓶红酒
And I need to get Braxton a bottle of wine.

174
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,390
都办完了
I took care of all that.

175
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,860
好的  谢谢
Good. Thanks.

176
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,890
你还有什么想说的吗
Is there anything else you want to talk about?

177
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,410
我想不到什么了
Not that I can think of.

178
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,100
你真的认为只要你装作我该主意了
Did you really think that if you just

179
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,100
我就真的会改主意吗
acted like I changed my mind that I'd change my mind?

180
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,590
得了吧  唐娜  路易
Oh, come on, Donna, Louis?

181
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,490
你觉得你俩能维持多久
I mean, how long do you think that's going to last?

182
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,120
我想维持多久就多久
It's gonna last however long I want it to last.

183
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,630
-唐娜  -哈维  这件事已经定了
- Donna-- - Harvey, this is happening.

184
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,820
这是给你的正式通知
This is my formal notice.

185
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,710
但我不会立刻把你晾下
But I have no intention of leaving you high and dry,

186
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,840
所以我们还是讨论一下
so let's talk about finding you

187
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,120
在两周内为你找一个新秘书吧
someone in the next two weeks.

188
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,510
-找个新秘书  -是的
- Finding me someone? - Yes.

189
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,370
我已经准备了一份市里最优秀法务秘书的名单
I already have a list of the top legal secretaries in the city.

190
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,750
你是说在你决定抛弃我之前
You mean you made a list for Louis

191
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,270
为路易准备的那份名单吗
before you decided to abandon me?

192
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,890
我没有抛弃你  哈维
I'm not abandoning you, Harvey.

193
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,180
我是为了自己着想
I'm doing what's best for me.

194
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,120
既然我们都在为自己着想
Well, as long as we're doing what's best for ourselves,

195
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,430
那你知道怎样对我最好吗
you know what's best for me?

196
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,480
直面伤痛
Ripping the Band-Aid off.

197
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,660
-哈维  -所以你还是赶快
- Harvey-- - So why don't you clean out

198
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,630
收拾你的东西搬去路易那里吧
your desk, walk yourself over to Louis,

199
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,140
顺便带上你的名单
and take that with you?

200
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,350
这不是两个互相在意的成年人向前看的方法
This isn't how two adults who care about each other move on.

201
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,370
在我看来  两个互相在意的成年人
As far as I'm concerned, two adults who

202
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,760
根本不用向前看
care about each other don't move on at all.

203
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,690
所以如果你要走  那就走吧
So, if you're gonna go, just go.

204
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,960
你在这干什么呢
What the hell are you doing in here?

205
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,040
凯文・斯莱特里已经等了20分钟了
Kevin Slattery's been waiting 20 minutes.

206
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,280
-什么  -凯文・斯莱特里
- What? - Kevin Slattery.

207
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,450
唐娜没告诉你吗
Didn't Donna tell you?

208
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,310
没有  她
No, she, um--

209
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,740
哈维  到底怎么了
Harvey, what's going on?

210
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,380
没怎么
Nothing's going on.

211
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,750
凯文・斯莱特里来这里干什么
Why is Kevin Slattery here?

212
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,930
他在找新律师
He's looking for a new lawyer,

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,420
我想让你去搞定他
and I'm looking for you to close him.

214
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,350
-为什么是我  -为什么不是你
- Why me? - Why not you?

215
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,100
因为全世界都知道
Because everybody and their mother knows

216
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,270
他们两周内就会破产
they're going bankrupt in two weeks

217
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,910
但我不是破产方面的专家
and I'm not a bankruptcy expert.

218
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,060
你在听我说话吗
Aren't you listening to me?

219
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,250
他不想宣布破产
He doesn't want to declare bankruptcy.

220
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,070
他想让你为他尽力一争
He wants you to fight for him.

221
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,350
那他今天可是来对了
Then he's come to me on the right day.

222
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,670
凯文  我听说你想打场硬仗
Kevin, I hear you're looking for a fight

223
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,180
我也知道我们的时间不多了
and I understand we don't have much time.

224
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,160
确实  但我刚浪费了半个小时等你
We don't, and I just wasted half an hour waiting for you.

225
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,200
所以在正式合作之前  你需要说服我
So, before we get to anything, you're gonna convince me

226
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,140
我为什么要和你合作
why I should go with you in the first place.

227
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,540
好吧  那我们没得谈了
Okay, we're done.

228
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,460
出去的时候别撞到门
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

229
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,820
-什么  -你听到我的话了
- What? - You heard me.

230
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,730
我们之中只有一个人面临破产  而那不是我
Only one of us is facing bankruptcy and it isn't me.

231
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,480
所以比起责骂我迟到
So instead of scolding me for being late,

232
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,560
你更需要说服我
you needed to be convincing me

233
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,280
为什么我要拯救你那濒死的公司
why I should save your dying company.

234
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,660
很高兴见到你
So, nice to meet you.

235
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,770
忠诚
Loyalty.

236
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,230
你刚说什么
What did you just say?

237
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,090
我现在有个能改变局面的合同
I have a game-changing contract that's guaranteed

238
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,410
只要我们能证明有偿付能力  六周内一定能拿到
to come my way in six weeks if we can show solvency.

239
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,640
谁来保证能拿到
Guaranteed by who?

240
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,810
我的大学室友
My college roommate.

241
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,320
你把这事告诉了你的银行家们
And you tell that to your bankers,

242
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,970
消息传出去了  有人来争
word gets out it's up for bid,

243
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,340
你的竞争对手出低价压制你
your competitors undercut you,

244
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,480
你的室友就帮不上你了
and your roommate won't be able to help you anymore.

245
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,870
但如果能撑六周  就能有转机
But if we make it six weeks, we're back in business.

246
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,740
我保证绝不抛弃你
And I guarantee we'll never leave you.

247
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,540
事情是这样的  凯文
Here's the thing, Kevin.

248
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,650
我才不在乎一家只能让我们的营业额
I don't give a shit about a regional trucking company

249
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,180
增加1%的地区货运公司
that's only going to increase our billings 1%.

250
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,230
我帮你起死回生
I get you out of this,

251
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,610
你们的股票肯定一路疯涨
your stock's gonna go through the roof.

252
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,150
-你想入股  -我要20%
- You want a piece. - I want 20%.

253
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,080
没门
No way.

254
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,950
别忘了  是你来找的我
You're the one coming to me. Okay?

255
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,910
握住80%总比一无所有强
80% of something is a whole lot better than 100% of nothing.

256
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,390
你对外也能像现在这么厉害吗
You gonna fight out there like you just did in here?

257
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,030
这只是赛前热身  凯文
This is the preseason, Kevin.

258
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,750
我连汗都没出呢
I haven't even broken a sweat.

259
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,060
有空吗
Do you have a second?

260
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,470
有  怎么了
Yeah, sure. What's going on?

261
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,670
唐娜  你在发抖吗
Donna, are you shaking?

262
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,320
我就不该期望...他能...
I never should have - expected him to--

263
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,190
出什么事了
What's going on?

264
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,580
没事  别在意  抱歉
You know what? Never mind. Sorry.

265
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,620
你想说什么
What did you want to talk about?

266
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,800
你不该期望谁怎么样
You never should've expected who to what?

267
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,860
出什么事了
What happened?

268
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,850
我要离开哈维
I'm leaving Harvey.

269
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,550
天哪
Oh, my God.

270
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,150
为什么
Why?

271
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,500
还记得我跟你说你再也回不了头了
You remember when I told you you could never go back,

272
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,090
然后我说我在撒谎吗
and then I said I lied about that?

273
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,970
结果发现我说自己在撒谎就是个谎言
Turns out I was lying when I said I lied.

274
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,070
所以你就要离开吗
So you're just gonna leave?

275
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,830
我不走  我去帮路易
No, I'm going to work for Louis.

276
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,220
什么  什么时候开始
What? When?

277
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,190
今天
Today.

278
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,260
对不起  瑞秋
I'm sorry, Rachel.

279
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,580
你不是来找我说这个的
You didn't come in here to talk about this.

280
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,510
-你想跟我说什么  -没事
- What did you wanna talk-- - No.

281
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,790
没什么
It's nothing.

282
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,280
不着急
It can wait.

283
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,910
-有东西要给我吗  -我什么时候空手过
- You got something for me? - When don't I?

284
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,530
我重写了你那个撤销科特案的烂动议
I redid your shitty motion to dismiss on Colter.

285
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,780
我的烂动议
My shitty motion?

286
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,300
你提到的那个判例就跟
Yeah, your precedents might as well have been

287
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,800
火石跟硬汉[摩登原始人主角]的关系
Flintstone v. Rubble.

288
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,470
《摩登原始人》是经典象征
Listen to me, The Flintstones is an iconic classic

289
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,790
能清晰的传达出一个事实
that clearly conveys the fact--

290
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,190
-你很老的事实吗  -这可是你
- That you're old? - Hey, you're the one

291
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,050
先提起那部动画的
who came up with the reference.

292
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,660
这传达出我很聪明的事实
Which conveys the fact that I'm smart.

293
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,190
今早有人用了自信爆棚
Wow, somebody took their confidence booster shot

294
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,020
-加速器啊  -其实  我是昨晚用的
- this morning. - Actually, I took it last night.

295
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,420
这个加速器就是我向瑞秋求婚了
And by took it, I mean I asked Rachel to marry me.

296
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,340
见鬼  我不该告诉你这个的
Oh shit, I wasn't supposed to tell you that,

297
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,450
但我说漏嘴了
but I just did.

298
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,950
那我先不祝贺你了
Then I won't say congratulations yet.

299
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,830
不  你还是可以祝贺的
Oh, no, you can still say it.

300
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,030
我也可以让你列出
I can also say I need a list

301
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,890
斯莱特里公司所有债权人的名单
of every one of Slattery Corp's creditors,

302
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,040
我昨天就要了
and I need it yesterday.

303
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,010
你为什么说这个而不是祝贺我
Now, why would you say that instead of congratulations?

304
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,450
因为我们只有不到两周时间
Because we have less than two weeks

305
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,630
阻止他们破产
to keep them out of bankruptcy

306
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,430
要做到这一点  就要知道凯文・斯莱特里
and we can't do that without knowing every person

307
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,100
究竟都欠谁的钱
Kevin Slattery owes a nickel to.

308
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,260
哈维  那估计得有五十多个人
Harvey, that list is gonna be over 50 names long.

309
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,010
两周之内不可能全都说服
There's no way we can get to all of them in two weeks.

310
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,050
与其告诉我做不到什么
You know what? Instead of telling me what we can't do

311
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,670
还管我要《新娘》杂志
and asking me for a copy of Brides Magazine,

312
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,750
你不如赶紧去把名单列好
why don't you just get the damn list together?

313
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,110
我们订婚的事你告诉他了
You told him we're engaged?

314
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,890
我没忍住  但现在我后悔了
I couldn't help myself. But I wish I hadn't told him.

315
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,920
哈维  出什么事了
Harvey, what's going on with you?

316
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,950
没事
Nothing's going on.

317
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,560
恭喜你们  好了  我说了
Congratulations. There, I said it.

318
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,000
我的日程表呢
Where the hell is my calendar?

319
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,170
昨天就在桌上
You know, I had it right here yesterday.

320
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,450
我不知道  我去叫唐娜
I don't know. I'll go get Donna.

321
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,630
不  别叫唐娜  我自己找
No, don't get Donna. I'll take care of it.

322
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,780
别叫唐娜是什么意思  
What do you mean don't get Donna?

323
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,550
我说了我自己找
I said I'll take care of it.

324
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,570
我找到了
I've got it right here.

325
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,600
谢谢  瑞秋
Thanks, Rachel.

326
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,750
这里是哈维・斯佩克特办公室
Harvey Specter's office.

327
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,240
他现在不在
No, he's not available right now.

328
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,420
需要留言吗
Can I take a message?

329
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,510
你为什么没告诉他唐娜的事
Why didn't you tell him about Donna?

330
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,550
因为我知道瑞秋知道  她会告诉他
Because I knew Rachel knew, and she'd tell him,

331
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,500
我就不需要浪费时间了
and then I wouldn't have to waste my time with it.

332
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,650
你是怕浪费时间还是怕有情绪
Waste time or feel something?

333
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,360
你觉得我不说就没有情绪了吗
You think I wasn't feeling something anyway?

334
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,800
你有什么情绪
And what were you feeling?

335
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,540
眼下  我感觉这个取证会
Right now, I'm feeling this deposition

336
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,600
-不会有尽头了  -这不是取证会
- is never going to end. - This isn't a deposition,

337
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,270
你也别想能轻易结束
and you're not getting out of this that easily.

338
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,940
我有点受够你这种态度了
You know what, I'm getting a little tired of your attitude.

339
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,220
什么态度
And what attitude is that?

340
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,800
你是指我拒绝为
The attitude where I'm not gonna supply

341
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,310
一个不肯向我说实话的人
prescription narcotics to someone

342
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,630
开麻醉药物吗
who won't tell me the truth?

343
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,970
是你那种一副比我自己还
The attitude that says you know me

344
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,060
了解我的态度
better than I know myself.

345
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,130
我没有说过我比你还了解你自己
I never said I know you better than you know yourself.

346
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,990
但你说我有事瞒着你
You said I'm keeping things from you.

347
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,960
你跟我一样清楚那就是事实
And that's something you know just as much as I do.

348
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,680
胡扯  我说的都是实话
Oh, bullshit. I've been telling the truth

349
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,880
我一句都没隐瞒全都告诉你了
this whole time and I haven't left out a goddamn word.

350
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,210
哈维  如果你非要这样
Okay, Harvey, if that's how you wanna play it.

351
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,180
那我就是比你了解你
I do know you better than you know yourself.

352
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,260
你进我门来四秒钟
I had you pegged about four seconds

353
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,580
我就看穿你了
after you walked in my door,

354
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,070
所以我知道杰西卡去找你时
which is why I know you weren't just

355
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,320
你不只是去洗脸了
washing your face when Jessica walked in.

356
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,340
你洗脸是因为你吐了
You were washing your face because you threw up.

357
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,480
你骗自己说是因为你病了
And you told yourself that you were coming down with something

358
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,610
或者吃坏东西了
or you had some bad clams.

359
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,140
但我来告诉你真相
But I'll tell you what really happened.

360
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,740
你吐了是因为你惊恐发作了
You threw up because you had a panic attack.

361
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,540
你来找我也不是
And you're not coming to me

362
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,170
因为你晚上睡不好觉
because you're having trouble sleeping.

363
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,570
你来找我是因为你害怕
You're coming to me because you're scared to death

364
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,730
这种事再次发生
that it'll happen again.

365
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,200
迈克  我能跟你谈谈吗
Mike, can I talk to you for a minute?

366
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,590
谈什么
What do you wanna talk about?

367
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,110
那位混蛋队长吗
Captain Dickhead back there?

368
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,580
我觉得我们现在不该对他这么苛刻
Look, I think maybe we should cut him a little slack.

369
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,510
他不知道我们订婚时
No, I cut him some slack when he

370
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,200
我就有放他一马
barely acknowledged our engagement.

371
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,520
然后我说要找唐娜来帮他
Then I tried to get Donna to help him

372
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,480
结果他要吃人一样
and he bites my head off.

373
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,510
干什么啊
What are you doing?

374
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,010
唐娜要离开他
Donna's leaving him.

375
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,920
还要去为路易工作
And she's going to work for Louis.

376
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,310
发生了什么
What the hell happened?

377
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,110
他们一起经历了那么多
They've been through everything together.

378
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,250
还有什么能
What could possibly--

379
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,600
天哪  他们越线了
Oh, my God, they crossed the line.

380
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,190
没那么简单
It's more complicated than that.

381
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,230
什么意思
What does that mean?

382
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,620
他们多年前就越线了
They crossed the line years ago.

383
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,270
那都无所谓了
You know what? It doesn't matter.

384
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,750
我也不想知道更多了  当然
I don't need to no anymore. Of course...

385
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,240
我们会尽量让着哈维的
we'll cut Harvey all the slack in the world.

386
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,880
我得晚点下班
Okay, I am going to stay late

387
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,310
帮他把事情整理好
and help him get everything in order.

388
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,070
但要记着
Hey, just keep in mind that

389
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,280
我让着他是一码事
cutting him some slack is one thing.

390
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,530
你去做唐娜的工作是另一码事
Doing Donna's job is another.

391
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,750
就一天
It's just one day.

392
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,300
又不是永远这样
It's not gonna last forever.

393
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,100
-你怎么知道我在这儿的  -很简单
- How'd you find me here? - Easy.

394
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,460
我知道今早那样吵架后  你肯定
I knew after this morning, you'd come in here

395
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,700
要来这里吃你的自怜三明治套餐
and your standard sandwich of commiseration.

396
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,050
我才没有什么自怜三明治套餐
I don't have a sandwich of commiseration--

397
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,080
黑麦面包  加培根不要俄式调味酱
Rueben on rye, with bacon instead of Russian dressing.

398
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,850
是全熟培根
Well-done bacon.

399
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,820
如果你不介意的话
And if it's all the same to you,

400
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,250
我喜欢一个人吃
I would prefer to eat by myself.

401
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,260
可以
Fine.

402
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,320
我只是来给你这个的
I just came in here to give you this.

403
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,120
{\an8}皮尔逊・斯佩克特・利特
唐娜・鲍尔森

404
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,290
你是说
You mean...

405
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,960
从今天起我就开始为你工作
Today is the day I work for you.

406
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,930
天哪
Oh, my God.

407
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,050
我简直不敢相信  这是真的吗
I can't believe it. This is really happening?

408
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,550
我们先做什么
What do we do first?

409
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,070
我现在好激动
I mean, I'm so goddamn turned on right now.

410
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,380
不知道  也许可以开始着手
I don't know. Maybe we could get a jump on

411
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,200
解决诺玛留下的山一样的事情
some of the things that have been piling up since Norma.

412
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,310
我的录音笔都满了
Well, my Dictaphone's at full capacity,

413
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,320
都快溢出来了
it's about to burst.

414
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,080
我可以帮你解决这个问题
Well, I could help you with that.

415
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,360
-真的吗  -当然
- Would you? - Of course.

416
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,860
那就是我的工作嘛
That's my job.

417
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,980
处理录音笔里堆积的内容
Relieving the pressure on your Dictaphone.

418
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,770
其实  也许我们
Okay, you know what? Maybe we're, um...

419
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,830
进展太快了
moving too quickly.

420
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,020
好吧  要不然
Okay. Well, how about

421
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,390
我先重新梳理你的日程
I just redo your calendar,

422
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,920
把你的每个案子都加上索引
and index every live case you have, and then get to know

423
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,990
彻底摸清你的文件整理系统
every single inch of your filing system.

424
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,250
我觉得这进展一点也没比刚才慢
I don't think that's moving less quickly.

425
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,870
最终到达终将来到的那一刻
Culminating in that inevitable moment

426
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,870
当你的电话响起
when your phone finally rings

427
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,540
我将说出那个带有魔力的词
and I say those three magic words.

428
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,530
我的神啊
Oh, good sweet Jesus.

429
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:09,180
路易・利特办公室
"Louis Litt's office."

430
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,930
该死的  女人  我们现在就回去
God damn it, woman, we're going back right now.

431
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,420
你结账  小费给10%
Take care of the bill. 10% tip.

432
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,720
让全熟培根滚蛋吧
Well-done bacon, my ass.

433
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,720
他可没在想滚床单的事
He's totally not thinking about sex right now.

434
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,300
告诉我你找到了全部五十个债权人
Tell me you found all 50 creditors.

435
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,480
不只找全了五十个  我还找到了该找的那个
Not just all 50. I found the one.

436
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,940
你怎么知道你找到的是该找的
How do you know you found the right one?

437
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,550
因为我知道你会怎么做
Because I know exactly what you're gonna do.

438
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,050
那你来看看我要怎么做吧
Then let me show you how I'm gonna do it.

439
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,490
你真打算要求他们这么做吗
You're really gonna make them do that?

440
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,170
-当然  -所有人
- Sure am. - All of them?

441
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,460
有几个人不吃这套
Doesn't work with some of them.

442
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,520
北方还是南方
North or South?

443
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,750
随你挑
Take your pick.

444
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,700
哈维  这主意太棒了
Well, Harvey, that's brilliant.

445
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,660
只有一个问题  这么做是违法的
There's only one problem. It's illegal.

446
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,690
让他们告啊  这是民事案件  又不是刑事案件
Let 'em sue us. It's civil, not criminal.

447
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,200
反正我们就是要吓唬他们一下
Besides, we're bluffing anyway.

448
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,500
要是我告诉你  我可以让它变得合法呢
What if I told you I have a way to make it legal anyway?

449
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,870
那你的点子最好快点生效
I'd say your idea better work fast

450
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,790
因为我们一小时后就得过去
because we're going over there in an hour.

451
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,510
文斯・山菲利普
Vince Sanfillipo?

452
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,470
正是
Yes.

453
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,380
你不转过来是有什么特殊原因吗
Is there a reason you're not turning around?

454
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,620
我喜欢跟一些来访者玩点小游戏
I like to play a little game with some of my visitors.

455
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,780
比如说  你用依云护肤霜
For example, you use Evian skin cream

456
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,530
偶尔会喷比翼双飞香水
and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

457
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,330
-但今天没有  -当然
- But not today. - Of course I do.

458
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,180
{\an8}出自《沉默的羔羊》

459
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,180
我是南部白种穷鬼的后代
I'm just one generation away from poor white trash.

460
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,850
一心想着走出去
And I could only dream of getting out.

461
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,080
走去天涯海角
Getting anywhere.

462
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,130
直走到联邦调查局
Getting all the way to the FBI.

463
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,960
曾经有个人口调查员也这么诈我来着
A census taker tried to test me once.

464
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,000
我就着蚕豆和美味的基安蒂红葡萄酒
I ate his liver with some fava beans

465
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,660
把他的肝脏吃了
and a nice Chianti.

466
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,420
你很有观察力  医生  但你能否用
You see a lot, Doctor. But are you strong enough

467
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,830
-你敏锐的观察力...  -等价交换  克拉丽斯
- to point that high-powered-- - Quid pro quo, Clarice--

468
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,540
行了  够了
All right. That's enough.

469
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,200
我们不是来对台词的
We didn't come here for a quote-off.

470
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,050
当然不是
No, you didn't.

471
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,850
你们是来让我多给凯文・斯莱特里一点时间
You came here to get me to give Kevin Slattery more time,

472
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,080
而这是不可能的
and that's never going to happen.

473
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,200
事实上  我们是来让你
Actually, we're here to get you to

474
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,250
收购与斯莱特里货运有关的全部债务
buy up every piece of debt associated with Slattery Freight

475
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,300
然后说服你多给他一点时间
and then get you to give him more time.

476
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,280
我为什么要这么做
And why would I do that?

477
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,390
为什么  因为你是最大的债权人
Why? Because you're the biggest debtholder,

478
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,090
如果其他债权人提出索赔
and if any of the others makes a claim,

479
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,520
将会使之破产  而你得在五年之后
it'll trigger bankruptcy, and you get 50 cents

480
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,230
才能收回一美元债务里的五十美分
on the dollar five years from tomorrow.

481
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,460
你以为你们能引用《沉默的羔羊》的台词
You think I'm gonna double down on a loser,

482
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,310
我就会在失败者身上加注吗
because you can quote Silence of the Lambs?

483
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,390
不  你会这么做是因为
No, you're gonna do it

484
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,170
一旦我们申请破产
because the day we file bankruptcy,

485
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,850
运输队的货车会直接开去加拿大
every truck in that fleet's going straight to Canada.

486
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,510
到时五十美分就只剩二十五美分了
And that 50 cents on the dollar just hit 25.

487
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,020
这是违法的  我会告你
But that's illegal and I will sue you

488
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,460
把你和你的客户告到死
and your client into the ground.

489
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,100
如果我们没有用一美元买下
Well, it would be illegal

490
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,550
一个倒闭的加拿大汽车货运公司的话
if we hadn't just a bought a defunct

491
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,360
确实是违法的
Canadian trucking company for a dollar.

492
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,320
胡扯
Bullshit!

493
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,830
你们的合同条款不允许你们这么做
Your covenants prohibits you from doing that.

494
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,880
赶在有人申报债权前就没事
Not if we do it before anyone calls in our debt.

495
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,230
而我们已经买了
Which we did.

496
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,730
你个狗娘养的
You're a son of a bitch.

497
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,870
我想到这个主意的时候
That's exactly what I thought of myself

498
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,080
也是这么觉得的
when I came up with the idea.

499
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,670
说句公道话  加拿大汽车货运公司
To be fair, I was the one that came up with

500
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,550
这个点子是我想出来的
the defunct Canadian trucking company thingy.

501
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,680
-所以...  -对  没错
- So... - Oh, yeah, you're right.

502
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,600
你也是个狗娘养的
You're a son of a bitch, too.

503
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,040
谢了  哈维  感激不尽
Oh, thanks, Harvey. I appreciate that.

504
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,750
你说我们是狗娘养的我们也认了
Well, now that we agree what we are,

505
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,500
现在的问题是  你打算怎么做呢
the question is, what are you gonna do about it?

506
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,370
笑什么呢
What's so funny?

507
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,290
我在想那个白痴
I was just thinking about that nutbag.

508
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,220
谁会那样跟人会面
Who starts a meeting off like that?

509
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,480
是啊  不过还是值得夸奖
Yeah, you got to give him credit, though.

510
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,550
多有意思啊
It was pretty fun.

511
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,590
你觉得他跟债权人也会玩这套吗
You think he's gonna do that bit with the creditors?

512
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,650
只要他肯收购债务
I don't care

513
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,390
就算他让他们把乳液往篮子里放
if he makes them put the lotion in the basket,

514
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,800
我也不在乎
as long as he buys up their debt.

515
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,650
不然又得用水冲[《沉默的羔羊》台词]
Or else it gets the hose again.

516
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,310
等一下  她是不是身材肥胖[台词]
Wait, was she a great big fat person?

517
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,490
今天干得漂亮  迈克
Good job today, Mike.

518
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,620
谢谢
Thanks.

519
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,900
这是不是意味着我争取到了
Does this mean I've earned the right

520
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,110
跟你聊聊唐娜事件的权利
for us to talk about the Donna situation?

521
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,130
没有什么唐娜事件
There is no Donna situation.

522
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,640
得了  我知道你不是感性的人  但是
Harvey, come on, I know you're not touchy-feely, but--

523
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,040
听着  没什么好聊的
Look, there's nothing to talk about,

524
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,530
因为这种情况不会长久
because it isn't gonna last.

525
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,830
好吧
Okay.

526
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,550
烤箱里有乔治亚的外卖  我重新热了
I got some Georgio's reheating in the oven.

527
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,260
你真是我的大救星
Oh, you are my hero.

528
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,710
我知道
Oh, I know.

529
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,820
谁说男人不会下厨了
I mean, who says that men can't cook?

530
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,440
我猜是乔治亚说的
I think Georgio's does.

531
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,970
这个观点很正确
That's a fair point.

532
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,430
你的考试怎么样了
So how was your test?

533
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,240
有那么差吗
Whoa, it was that bad?

534
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,510
你都学疯了
You studied like crazy.

535
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,750
不  不是考得差
No, it's not that it was that bad.

536
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,990
而是
I just...

537
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,680
我没去考
I didn't take it.

538
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,390
你说没考是什么意思
What do you mean you didn't take it?

539
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,390
我决定熬夜帮哈维
I decided to stay late and help Harvey.

540
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,760
帮哈维干什么
Help Harvey what?

541
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,210
算了  我知道干什么
Never mind. I know what.

542
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,120
肯定是唐娜的工作
Something that would've been done by Donna

543
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,850
应该由他的新秘书做
and should've been done by his new secretary

544
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,920
但他还没有雇新的
except he hasn't hired one yet.

545
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,140
是你说我们应该尽可能地
You're the one who said we should cut him as much slack

546
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,090
体谅他
as he needs.

547
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,010
我是说容忍他的混蛋行径
I meant tolerating him being a dick.

548
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,610
可不是让你逃学
Not you flunking out of school.

549
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,030
上次我向哈维要求放假
The last time I asked Harvey for time off,

550
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,450
他告诉我说  工作就是我的法学课
he told me work is my law school,

551
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,790
而他是对的
and he was right.

552
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,710
我不会在他最需要我的时候要求休息
I'm not gonna ask him for time when he needs me the most.

553
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,450
怎么了
What?

554
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,290
-怎么了  -我只是想到
- What? - I was just thinking about

555
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,560
当我向你求婚的时候
when I asked you to marry me,

556
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,570
我说  你是那么坚强
I said how tenacious you are.

557
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,910
我知道
Well, I know.

558
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,930
你该知道自己爱上的是什么样的人
It's like you should know what you're getting yourself into.

559
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,750
但你知道你不戴戒指
But you see what happens when you don't wear that collar

560
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,120
-会发生什么吗  -闭嘴
- on your finger? - Stop it.

561
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,030
简直不能相信  你真的属于我了
I can't believe you're really mine.

562
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,830
那么  放哪里比较好呢
Now, where would be the perfect place to...

563
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,110
早上好  路易
Good morning, Louis.

564
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,740
老天  我都被你吓尿了
Holy shit. You just scared the shit out of me.

565
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,160
你怎么来的这么早
What are you doing here so early?

566
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,380
已经八点十五分了
It's 8:15.

567
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,590
没错  但昨晚我们工作到很晚
Well, yeah, but we worked late last night,

568
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,080
我让你今天上午休息一下
and I told you to take the morning.

569
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,260
路易  我才来第二天  我不会休息的
Louis, it's day two, I'm not taking anything.

570
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,250
该死
Oh, shoot.

571
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,770
我懂了
I get it.

572
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,880
你来得早是因为你给我买了
You came in early because you bought me

573
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,200
很贵重的礼物  而且你想
an expensive gift and you wanted to

574
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,380
放在我桌上  让我惊喜
surprise me by putting it on my desk.

575
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,300
差不多吧
Something like that.

576
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,200
你想让我走开吗  这样就可以给我惊喜了
Do you want me to go? You can still surprise me.

577
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,980
还是算了
Never mind.

578
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,540
鉴于你已经来了
Uh... Being that you're here,

579
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,930
有个潜在客户九点会来
I have a prospective client coming in at 9:00.

580
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,360
不会来了
No, you don't.

581
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,310
什么意思  那混蛋取消了约会
What do you mean? The asshole canceled?

582
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,540
不  那混蛋故意提前了一小时  来过了
No, the asshole intentionally showed up an hour early

583
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,390
我让他回家了  让他一小时后再来
and I sent him home, telling him he was an hour late.

584
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,520
什么  你疯了吗
What, are you crazy?

585
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,520
那可是卡尔・菲尔茨  唐娜
That was Carl Fields, Donna.

586
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,760
没准能赚他一千二百万  你却让他回去了
$12 million in billings you let walk out the door.

587
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,540
不  一千二百万已经到手
No, that's 12 million in billings that's coming your way

588
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,770
因为现在他知道你不会随他摆布
because now he knows you're not someone to be trifled with.

589
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,130
不  你怎么知道
No, you can't know that.

590
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,520
是吗  因为我刚刚接到
Really? Because I just got off the phone

591
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,580
他秘书打来的电话  他们希望你能一小时后
with his secretary, and they're expecting you to come by

592
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,740
带着委托书过去一趟
with an engagement letter in an hour.

593
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,680
不是吧
Holy shit!

594
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,830
-该死  -怎么了
- Oh, shit. - What?

595
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,690
什么问题
What's the problem?

596
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,560
我还在用旧打印机打印
I'm still printing to my old printer.

597
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,920
什么  打印委托书吗
What, for the engagement letter?

598
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,930
唐娜  拜托  你做得够多了
Donna, please, you've done enough.

599
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,940
我过去拿就好
Let me take care of it.

600
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,510
以为我没注意到吗
Like I wouldn't notice.

601
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,430
这是才你的位置  小东西
There you go, little fella.

602
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,710
我  我只是
I was, I was just...

603
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,150
没事  路易  不管你在干什么
It's fine, Louis. Whatever you were doing,

604
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,020
-没事的  -哈维
- it's fine. - Hey, Harvey,

605
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,150
如果你对唐娜的事有任何不愉快...
if there are any hard feelings with Donna...

606
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,640
不  路易  没有不愉快
No, Louis. No hard feelings.

607
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,680
但我只想说  如果万一有...
Okay, but I just want to say, if there was...

608
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,450
我说了  没有
I said there's no hard feelings.

609
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,550
既然说到这
As a matter of fact,

610
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,200
帮我告诉唐娜  我让她拿走这个
why don't you tell Donna I want her to have this?

611
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,340
{\an8}路易的秘书候选名单

612
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,310
她要抛弃你了
She's leaving you.

613
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,110
你想见我
You wanted to see me?

614
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,760
那是一小时前的事了
That was an hour ago.

615
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,720
我刚刚听说
Well, I just heard.

616
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,730
而我刚刚听说你和迈克的
And I just heard the results

617
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,860
小小强硬策略
of your little strong-arm tactic with Mike.

618
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,300
你是说  你听说那办法行得通
You mean you heard that it worked.

619
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,000
我知道你逼迫他们照你希望做事了
Oh, I know you got them to do what you wanted.

620
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,730
他们欺压了所有其他债权人
They bullied all the other creditors,

621
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,680
买了他们所有的债务
bought off all their debt,

622
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,890
而且他们会等待八个星期
and they're going to back off for eight weeks.

623
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,980
为什么你看起来有点生气
Why do you seem pissed?

624
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,170
因为你的名单上  少了一个债权人
Because you left a creditor off the list.

625
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,290
什么  怎么可能
What? How could that happen?

626
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,320
我不知为什么会出这种事
I don't know how it happened,

627
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,440
但我知道这意味着什么
but I know what it means.

628
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,780
他们会用这个来要挟我们的
We're gonna get held hostage.

629
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,970
我会处理的
I'll take care of it.

630
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,860
而如果你处理不了  斯莱特里真的破产了
And if you can't take care of it and Slattery goes bankrupt,

631
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,730
你最好能想出办法把他留住
you better figure out a way to keep him here.

632
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,960
这是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

633
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,150
意思是杰克・索罗夫正在律所里到处说
It means Jack Soloff's been going around the firm

634
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,200
你不可能挽救那家公司
saying you're never gonna save that company

635
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,290
而如果你真的不成功  我们也没有计划
and we don't have a plan to retain their business

636
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,410
能留住他们
when you don't.

637
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,510
你什么时候开始在乎杰克・索罗夫说什么了
Since when do you care about what Jack Soloff says?

638
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,280
自从他成了一个有野心的资深合伙人
Since he's a senior partner with ambition

639
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,140
而你在两天之内失误了两次
and you dropped the ball twice in the two days.

640
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,540
如果你这么害怕他  干吗不直接炒了他
If you're so afraid of him, why don't you just fire him?

641
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,530
我不害怕任何人
I'm not afraid of anybody,

642
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,470
我也从没说过有野心是坏事
and I never said ambition was a bad thing.

643
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,770
-杰西卡  -哈维
- Jessica-- - Harvey,

644
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,830
我不知道你和唐娜之间是怎么回事
I don't know what's going on between you and Donna,

645
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,190
但我知道你选择不用我参与这件事
but I do know you chose not to let me in on it,

646
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,960
所以我就让你自己处理
so I'm gonna let you in on this.

647
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,790
如果想不出没有她怎么好好工作
If you can't figure out how to get shit done

648
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,900
我可就要想办法了
without her, I will.

649
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,750
和菲尔茨先生的会面怎么样
How'd it go with Mr. Fields?

650
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,740
还行  不过在你拍断胳膊
Fine, but before you dislocate your arm

651
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,720
夸自己做得很好之前
patting yourself on the back,

652
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,870
我需要你今天离开前把这些归档
I need you to file those before you leave today.

653
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,620
全都要吗
All of them?

654
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,920
是的  全都要  "这些"就是全部的意思
Yes, all of them. That's what "those" means.

655
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,540
还有  明早前把我的办公软件升级好
And then I want you to update my Word Perfect by the morning.

656
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,220
路易  我买了剧院八点场的票
Louis, I have tickets to the theater at 8:00.

657
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,750
刚工作第二天你就绝不加班吗
Second day and you're already taking banking hours?

658
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,070
好吧  我可不认为八点算是...
Okay, I hardly think 8:00 constitutes--

659
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,850
诺玛全年无休地每天工作到深夜
Norma worked till midnight eight days a week

660
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,880
还从没嘟囔过
and never bunted an eye.

661
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,170
-嘟囔  -对  嘟囔
- Bunted? - Yes, bunted.

662
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,420
你现在对我用词也有意见了吗
You have a problem with my words now?

663
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,530
好吧  路易  我不知道
Okay, Louis, I don't know

664
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,280
你是漏喝你的美容饮料了还是怎么着
if you skipped your afternoon prunie or what,

665
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,690
但你现在让我非常不舒服
but you're making me feel uncomfortable.

666
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,310
那咱们就把话说清楚
Well, let's get something straight.

667
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,490
我不是来让你的生活变舒服的
I'm not here to make your life comfortable.

668
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,520
应该是你让我的生活变舒服
You're here to do that for me.

669
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,390
还有下次你再用错误的打印机打了东西
And the next time you print something to the wrong copier,

670
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,710
你自己去拿
get it yourself.

671
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,440
我就给了你一项任务  找到斯莱特里
I gave you one job-- to find every single one

672
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,390
所有的债权人  然后你还搞砸了
of Slattery's creditors, and you screwed it up.

673
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,290
-你在说什么  -你漏了一个
- What are you talking about? - You left one off the list,

674
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,330
等他们意识到
and as soon as they realize

675
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,260
我们买断了其他所有人的债权
that we bought out everyone else,

676
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,220
他们就会知道我们达成了协议
they'll know we have a deal

677
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,660
然后他们就会申报债权
and they'll call in their debt

678
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,970
然后整个事情就全完了
and the whole thing will blow up.

679
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,420
等等  他们还没申报债权吗
Wait a second, they haven't even called it in yet?

680
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,550
没有  当然还没有
No, they haven't called it in yet,

681
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,280
因为他们会等到最后一刻
because they're gonna wait till the last second

682
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,440
那样他们就可以任意摆布我们了
so they can hold us over a barrel

683
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,210
就因为你没做好你的工作
because you didn't do your job.

684
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,280
现在我得去找能制衡凯森金融公司的筹码了
And now I gotta find some leverage on Katzen Financial.

685
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,540
我没有漏掉凯森金融公司
I didn't miss Katzen Financial.

686
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,720
那为什么他们不再单子上
Then why weren't they on the list?

687
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,620
我不知道  他们明明就在单子上  我给了
I don't know, they were on the list when I sent it--

688
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,230
见鬼  瑞秋
Goddamn Rachel.

689
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,110
哈维
Harvey!

690
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,260
凯森是单子上最后一家
Katzen was the last name on that list

691
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,030
而且是最后一页上唯一一家  好吗
and the only name on that page, all right?

692
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,670
肯定是打印机没纸了
The printer must have just run out of paper.

693
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,790
这不是瑞秋的错
This isn't Rachel's fault.

694
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,810
那我要怎么和凯文・斯莱特里说
What am I supposed to tell Kevin Slattery?

695
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,950
"你失去你的公司是因为
"The reason you're losing your company

696
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,010
我的助理律师没给打印机装纸吗"
is because my associate didn't load the printer"?

697
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,320
我不知道  为什么不告诉他真相
I don't know, how about you tell him the truth?

698
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,730
他可能失去他公司的原因
That the reason he may lose his company

699
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,490
是你不肯雇个新秘书
is because you didn't hire a secretary.

700
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,170
这话什么意思
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

701
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,170
你知道什么意思
You know what it means.

702
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,950
瑞秋一直在拼了命地照顾你
Rachel has been killing herself to take care of you,

703
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,960
而我们什么都没说
and we haven't said anything

704
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,840
就因为我们俩都同意要体谅你
because we both agreed to cut you some slack.

705
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,130
-我们  -是的  我们
- We? - Yeah, we,

706
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,360
但我不能让你因为搞砸了一件
but I'm not gonna let you come down on her

707
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,090
本来就不是她工作的事而训斥她
for screwing up something that wasn't her job.

708
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,780
她的工作就是照我说的去做
Her job is to do what I say,

709
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,430
你最好意识到这一点
and you better wrap your head around that.

710
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,990
不  哈维  你最好意识到唐娜已经走了
No, Harvey you better wrap your head around the fact

711
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,820
而且她不会再回来了这个事实
that Donna is gone and she is not coming back.

712
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,700
我告诉过你  她和路易之间不会长久的
And I told you, it's not gonna last with her and Louis.

713
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,910
你坚持这样说
You keep saying that,

714
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,940
可我眼见唐娜坐在路易的办公室外
but all I see is donna outside Louis's office

715
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,580
而你办公室外却空无一人
and no one outside yours.

716
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,580
所以你最好放下身段去请她帮忙
So you better swallow your pride and ask her for help,

717
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,120
或者雇个新秘书  反正不管怎么样
or hire a new secretary, but either way,

718
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,580
你不能拿瑞秋撒气
you're done taking it out on Rachel.

719
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,960
你有时间吗
Hey, there, you got a minute?

720
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,840
几乎没有
Barely.

721
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,010
我需要你之前跟我说的那两个星期
I need those two weeks you offered me before.

722
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,410
恐怕现在说太晚了
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

723
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,290
唐娜  我快完蛋了
Donna, I'm drowning.

724
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,910
斯莱特里这个案子...
This whole thing with the Slattery deal is--

725
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,320
对于你的案子我很遗憾  哈维
I'm sorry about your deal, Harvey,

726
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,850
但你当初拒绝我前就该想到这一点
but you should have thought about that before you turned me down.

727
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,210
所以你在惩罚我吗
So you're punishing me?

728
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,560
我没有惩罚你
I'm not punishing you.

729
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,480
可我自己的活都堆积如山  就算没有
But I have a mountain of work, and even if I didn't,

730
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,850
如果我突然又开始为你做事了
how do you think Louis would feel if I suddenly

731
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,200
你觉得路易会怎么想
started working for you again?

732
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,320
我才不管路易怎么想
I don't give a shit how Louis feels.

733
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,960
那你考虑过我的感受吗
Well, what about how I feel?

734
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,810
你现在又在动摇我的心意
Which is that you're trying to undermine my decision.

735
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,010
我怎么能动摇你的心意呢
How the hell am I trying to undermine your decision?

736
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,800
那这个算什么
What do you call this?

737
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,170
那是之前...
That--that was before--

738
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,340
什么之前  在你碰到路易之前
Before what? Before you ran into Louis?

739
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,200
在你需要我的帮助之前  什么之前
Before you needed my help? What?

740
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,900
唐娜
Donna--

741
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,170
你知道我在哪里找到的吗
Do you know where I found this?

742
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,370
出于关心我还留着那份秘书候选名单
Louis put it right on top of the list of secretaries

743
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,620
而路易恰恰把它放在了那份名单上
that I have been keeping for you because I still care about you,

744
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,130
你知道这两件事共同的结果是什么
and you know what they both did?

745
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,860
刚好触发了他的噩梦
They fed right into his nightmare

746
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,940
让他觉得我要离开他
that I'm gonna leave him,

747
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,520
而这就是你想要的结果
which is exactly what you wanted.

748
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,620
你知道要我放下身段
Do you know how hard it is for me

749
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,700
到这里来找你有多难吗
to swallow my pride and come over here?

750
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,400
那你知道要我拒绝你又有多难吗
Do you know how hard it is for me to say no to you?

751
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,830
那就别拒绝
Then don't.

752
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,090
我只是要你帮我做一件小事
I am asking you for one little thing.

753
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,020
不  哈维  不是一件小事
No, Harvey, it's not one little thing.

754
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,200
今天是斯莱特里收购案
Today it's the Slattery deal,

755
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,320
明天是韦斯合并案
tomorrow's the Weiss merger,

756
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,530
而后天
and then the day after that,

757
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,670
就会是成千上万其他事情
it will be a million other things

758
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,160
直到你觉得一切恢复原样了
until you think everything is back to normal.

759
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,250
但回不去了  这就是新常态
Well, it's not. This is the new normal.

760
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,930
现在我的办公桌在这  对你我爱莫能助
This is my desk now, and I wish I could help you, but I can't.

761
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,250
唐娜  别这样
Donna, please.

762
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,420
抱歉  哈维  你得靠自己了
I'm sorry, Harvey, you're on your own.

763
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,490
就在那一刻  对吧
And that's when it happened, isn't it?

764
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,350
你的恐慌症又发作了
You had another one.

765
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,300
我不...不想谈了
I don't--I don't want to talk about it.

766
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,740
要解决问题第一步就是不回避
Step one to making them stop is talking about it.

767
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,420
我无法思考  也看不见  我...
I couldn't think, I couldn't see, I c--

768
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,800
不能呼吸
I couldn't breath.

769
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,770
然后你做了什么
And what did you do?

770
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,060
你明知故问
You know what I did.

771
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,460
对  但我要你说出来
No, I know. I need you to say it.

772
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,310
为什么
Why?

773
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,730
因为说得越多  它对你的影响就越小
'Cause the more you say it, the less power it has over you.

774
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,700
我走进洗手间
I made my way into the bathroom,

775
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,790
我听见心脏剧烈跳动  然后
and my heart was p-pounding, and

776
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,650
我的胸要炸开了
my chest cracked open.

777
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,330
就像...就像我溺水了一样
It was--it was like I was under water.

778
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,960
我看着隔间  那有两只鞋
I looked at the stall, and there was...two shoes there,

779
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,770
屎色棕的鞋  没系鞋带  两个人在笑
a piece-of-shit brown shoe, untied, two guys laugh--

780
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,960
好的  然后呢
Yeah, and then?

781
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,420
我冲进隔间  开始呕吐
I ran to the stall, I threw up,

782
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,450
然后我就待在那里  直到那种感觉结束
and I just waited until it was over.

783
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,640
那天晚上你就来找我了
And that's the night you came to see me.

784
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,430
没错
Yeah.

785
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,870
还编了一个睡眠障碍的谎话
And you made up a story about having trouble sleeping

786
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,420
来骗我开抗焦虑药
to get antianxiety medication,

787
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,800
从那之后你就每天吃一粒
and you've been taking a pill a day since.

788
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,240
没错
Yes.

789
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,200
在忙
Busy.

790
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,750
路易
Louis...

791
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,730
我没有要离开你
I'm not leaving you.

792
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,480
上面写着"路易的秘书候选名单"
It says, "Replacements for Louis"

793
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,950
那上面就这么写着"路易的秘书候选名单"
Right here on top, "Replacements for Louis."

794
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,090
因为那是诺玛死后我做的
That's because that's the list I made after Norma died.

795
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,550
那你为什么还留着
Then why do you still have it?

796
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,180
我留着给哈维的
Because I was saving it for Harvey.

797
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,930
这是给哈维的
This is for Harvey?

798
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,700
对  路易  因为我现在替你做事了
Yes, Louis, because I work for you now,

799
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,080
我想告诉你别再怀疑
and I'd like to tell you to stop questioning

800
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,450
我是否会改变心意了
whether I'm gonna change my mind,

801
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,120
我们都知道这不可能
but we both know that's never gonna happen,

802
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,790
所以我想说...
so instead, I'll say...

803
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,060
如果你怀疑我就直接告诉我
you need to talk to me about it when it does.

804
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,780
我告诉过你啊  唐娜
But I did talk to you, Donna.

805
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,150
我先是加大你的工作量  然后吼你
First, I loaded you up with work, then I yelled at you,

806
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,090
后来还把开罐器放在名单上面
and then I put the can-opener on top of that list.

807
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,560
我不能再直接了
I mean, I can't be more direct than that.

808
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,250
可以的  路易
Yes, you can, Louis.

809
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,510
我不想再有任何不坦诚的关系了
Because I don't want that kind of relationship anymore.

810
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,240
那是做什么用的
What's it for?

811
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,150
什么是做什么用的
What's what for?

812
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,260
那个开罐器
The can opener.

813
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,670
就是一个开罐器  路易
It's just a can opener, Louis.

814
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,010
不  没那么简单
No, it's not.

815
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,330
哈维给我的时候想传达某种信息
Harvey was sending me a message when he gave it to me.

816
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,450
那个信息不是给你的
That message wasn't meant for you.

817
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,740
是要传达给我的
It was meant for me.

818
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,040
唐娜  你要我开诚布公
Donna, you want me to talk to you,

819
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,480
但你现在却含糊其辞
but now you're not talking to me.

820
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,980
那是哈维和我在每次出庭前
It was a ritual that Harvey and I would do

821
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,490
都会有的一个仪式
before we went to trial.

822
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,450
所以他想表达的意思是
So the message was,

823
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,420
唐娜  你和我就永远不会有那样的仪式
Donna, you'll never have something like that with me.

824
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,190
不  路易  不是那样
No, Louis, that's not what--

825
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,700
我们该有一个仪式
We should have a ritual.

826
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,750
等我们赢下第一件大案子再考虑吧
Let's worry about that after we win our first big case.

827
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,180
我本来还想请你喝一杯呢
I was just about to offer you one of those.

828
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,080
杰西卡  如果你是来再骂我一通的话
Jessica, if you're here to yell at me again--

829
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,580
我不是来吼你的
I'm not here to yell at you.

830
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,510
我是来跟你道歉的
I'm here to apologize to you.

831
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,340
那就一起喝一杯吧
Then you can have a drink.

832
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,360
事实上  一个好的合伙人知道这其中的区别
The truth is, there's a time for yelling

833
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,290
既要有骂人的时候
and there is a time for understanding,

834
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,560
也要有理解人的时候
and a good partner knows the difference.

835
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,390
你是指一个好的管理合伙人吧
You mean a good managing partner.

836
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,600
不  就是好的合伙人
No, I mean a good partner.

837
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,340
那晚你发现唐娜有麻烦了
The night you found out Donna was in trouble,

838
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,020
但你做的第一件事  却是挤了时间
the first thing you did was take the time...

839
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,730
和我喝一杯  聊了杰夫
to have a drink with me about Jeff.

840
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,990
所以  至少我能花点时间
So the least I could do is take the time

841
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,830
来理解你的情况
and understand your situation.

842
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,930
你是指  我已经没有秘书的事实吗
You mean, the fact that I don't have a secretary.

843
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,870
我是指  你一定要打包一起来工作的女人
I mean that after 12 years, the woman you wouldn't

844
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,310
十二年后  却在为别人做事
come work here without is now working for someone else.

845
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,410
所以你想知道原因
And you want to know why.

846
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,940
我不用知道原因
I don't need to know why.

847
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,460
我要知道你想不想让我帮你恢复原状
I need to know if you want me to undo it.

848
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,820
什么
What?

849
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,730
我知道你和唐娜不像我跟杰夫
I know you and Donna aren't me and Jeff,

850
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:37,310
但是你们俩的亲密无间
but you are as close as two people can be

851
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,930
不是恋人胜似恋人
without being that.

852
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,880
该死  哈维  斯科特走的时候
Shit, Harvey, Scottie leaving

853
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,930
你都没这么受打击颓废过
didn't throw you off your game this much.

854
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,570
谢谢你的好意
I appreciate the offer.

855
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,320
但只要唐娜想为路易工作
But as long as Donna wants to work for Louis,

856
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,920
我就不会强迫她再回来为我做事
I am not gonna force her to work for me.

857
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,560
好吧
Okay.

858
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,780
哈维  你有没有想过
Harvey, have you thought about

859
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,140
要是唐娜真的不回来了怎么办
what's going to happen if she doesn't come back?

860
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,160
她会回来的
She will.

861
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:18,890
哇
Wow.

862
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,480
哇什么
Wow what?

863
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,800
杰西卡听着真是个女中豪杰
This Jessica sounds like a hell of a woman.

864
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,480
这跟我说的事有什么关系
What does that have to do with anything?

865
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,500
没什么关系  我  我只是
No, it doesn't. I-I was just--

866
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,210
我不管你在干嘛
Look, I don't care what you were doing.

867
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,660
我们已经待得够久了
We've been here long enough.

868
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,440
是的
Hmm, we have.

869
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,200
但我不会给你另外开药了
But I'm not gonna give you another prescription.

870
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,000
你说要是我敞开心扉
You said if I opened up--

871
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,320
我说要是你不敞  我就不开
I said if you didn't, I wouldn't.

872
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,230
我可没说你敞了我就会开啊
I didn't say if you did, I would.

873
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,190
这可不是一回事
They're not the same thing.

874
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,300
该死
Goddamn it.

875
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,160
等等  你听我把话说完
Hold on, you didn't let me finish.

876
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,920
我不会再给你另开药
I'm not gonna write you another prescription.

877
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,250
但给你这个
I'm gonna give you these.

878
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,720
够你吃一周的了
That's enough for another week.

879
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,840
你想让我下次再来
You want me to come in here again.

880
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,990
当然
Mm, I sure do.

881
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,630
你也可以摇着骰子慢慢吃
Or you can roll the dice and spread them out,

882
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,090
但你不再来我这儿就拿不到新的
but you're not getting anymore without seeing me again.

883
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,640
还有
One more thing.

884
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,100
恐慌症会一直发作
These episodes are gonna keep happening

885
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,170
直到你接受唐娜有可能再也不会回来的现实
until you accept the fact that Donna may never come back.

886
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,570
你整个早上都去哪儿了
Where the hell have you been all morning?

887
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,930
你是我什么人  老妈吗
What are you, my mother?

888
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,380
我去开会了  怎么了
I was at a meeting. Why?

889
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,760
还记得你说凯森要
Remember when you said Katzen was gonna

890
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,040
等到最后一秒让我们不得翻身吗
wait till the last second to hold us over a barrel?

891
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,940
可是他们没有  他们把所有的债务
Well, they didn't. They sold all of their debt

892
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,140
卖给了凯文・斯莱特里最强的竞争对手
to Kevin Slattery's biggest competitor.

893
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,820
他们想把我们一击击倒  一劳永逸
They're gonna want to put us in the ground for good.

894
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,580
那幸好我已经想出办法
Well, then it's a good thing I figured out a way

895
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,050
说服他们别这么干了
to convince 'em not to.

896
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,220
那我们还傻站在这儿干嘛
What the hell are we still doing here?

897
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,120
你说呢
You tell me.

898
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,840
到底是怎么回事
What the hell happened?

899
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,330
大西洋货运公司是我的主要对手
Atlantic Freight is my chief rival.

900
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,320
如果他们要收回债务
If they call in the debt,

901
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,070
他们会强制宣告我破产的
they'll force me into bankruptcy.

902
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,770
前提是他们要收回债务
If they call in the debt.

903
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,610
他什么意思
What is he talking about?

904
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,040
他的意思是  我们刚和他们开了个会
He's talking about the fact that we just came from a meeting with them,

905
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,730
并且你是对的
and you're right.

906
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,340
对他们来说  把你彻底击倒  一劳永逸
They'd love nothing more than to put you down

907
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,700
是最好不过了
once and for all.

908
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,460
他妈的
Goddamn it.

909
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,810
但好消息是  我们告诉他们
But lucky for you, we told them

910
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,710
如果他们迫使你破产
that if they force you into bankruptcy,

911
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,750
那未必会搞垮你的公司
that doesn't necessarily kill your company,

912
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,460
但买下你的冠名权会
but buying your name does.

913
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,690
所以我现在归他们了  这就是你的天才方案
So they own me? That's your brilliant solution?

914
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,730
不是  他们有的是斯莱特里的商标
No, they own the Slattery trademark,

915
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,710
并且认为这是打垮你的最有效方法
which they think effectively puts you under,

916
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,210
但是他们不知道我们知道的事
but they don't know what we know.

917
00:35:59,210 --> 00:35:59,950
你们知道什么
And what is that?

918
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,360
你还有另外一份合同
That you have another contract

919
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,440
这份合同不管你公司的名称
that doesn't care about the name of your company.

920
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,100
他们只在乎所有者的名称
They only care about the name of the owner.

921
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,380
凯森是怎么知道要卖债权的
How the hell did Katzen even know to sell their debt?

922
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,110
因为我失误了
Because I made a mistake.

923
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,830
妈的你是失误了
You sure as hell did!

924
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,940
你要了我公司20%的股份
After asking for 20% of my company

925
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,060
还夸下海口说你能救下它
and bragging that you could save it.

926
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,650
结果却证明  你只是个自大的说嘴货
Well, it turns out it, you're just an arrogant mouthpiece

927
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,340
觉得自己能拯救一切
that thinks he can save anything.

928
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,370
但其实你做不到
But you can't.

929
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:26,070
凯文  没人比我更讨厌改变
Kevin, nobody hates change more than I do,

930
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,710
但无论你是否喜欢  改变都会发生
but it's coming whether we like it or not.

931
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,700
如果我可以同时拯救你的公司和你的冠名
And if I could save both your company and your name,

932
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,570
我会  但你说对了  我做不到
I would, but you're right, I can't.

933
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,370
所以接受交易吧  明天醒来  去上班
So take the deal, wake up tomorrow, and go to work.

934
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,520
哈维
Hey, Harvey?

935
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,020
怎么
Yeah.

936
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,350
我只想说谢谢
I just want to say thanks...

937
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,480
谢谢你没让我们承担责任
for not throwing us under the bus back there.

938
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,400
什么意思
What do you mean?

939
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,700
你本可以告诉凯文・斯莱特里实话
Well, I mean, you could have told Kevin Slattery the truth.

940
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,720
错误是我和瑞秋犯下的
That mistake was mine and Rachel's.

941
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,730
不  不是
No it wasn't.

942
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,360
你之前说对了  是我的错
You were right, that mistake was mine.

943
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,770
你这么晚在这儿干嘛
Hey. What are you doing here so late?

944
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,730
你没听说吗
You didn't hear?

945
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,180
戴维斯兄弟的案子解决了
We closed the Davis brothers.

946
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,810
-那可是大事  -是的
- That's huge. - It is.

947
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,360
我在想这可能是个绝佳的时机
So I thought maybe this was the perfect time

948
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,960
来建立我们的仪式
to start our ritual.

949
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,650
唐娜  我在想
Oh, Donna, listen, I've been thinking.

950
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,180
我们或许不需要仪式
I don't think we need to have a ritual.

951
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,420
来吧  这是我们第一个大胜利
Come on. It's our first big win.

952
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,360
跟我给迈克的蛋糕一模一样
That's the same exact cake I got Mike.

953
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,200
我知道
I know.

954
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,460
你怎么知道的
How did you know?

955
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,890
我可是唐娜
I'm Donna.

956
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,230
你确实是
You sure are.

957
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,420
什么口味的
What flavor is it?

958
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,720
我打电话给埃斯特  她说
Well, I called Esther, and she said

959
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,560
你最爱是德国巧克力味
German Chocolate was your favorite.

960
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,460
我讨厌德国巧克力
I hate German Chocolate.

961
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,220
所以我买了摩卡软糖味
Which is why I got you Mocha Fudge.

962
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,270
完美
It's perfect.

963
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,970
有什么事吗  哈维
What can I do for you, Harvey?

964
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,590
我想看看那个名单还在不在你这里
I just wanted to see if you still had that list.

965
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,720
当然在
Of course I do.

966
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:42,680
这是什么
What's this?

967
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,210
你的订婚礼物
Your engagement present.

968
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,140
拜托  瑞秋  你觉得
Come on, Rachel, how long did you think

969
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,760
你浑身那光芒还能藏多久
you could keep that glow a secret?

970
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,410
我有光芒
I'm glowing?

971
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,370
跟除夕夜的时代广场一样亮
Like Times Square on New Year's Eve.

972
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,420
在我看来
To me.

973
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,990
世界其他人都没法
The rest of the world can't even see you

974
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,610
在你担下的大堆哈维的工作底下看到你
under that pile of work you took on to help Harvey.

975
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,290
你还知道那个
You knew about that too?

976
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,230
我当然知道
Of course I did,

977
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,870
所以你得到了这个
which is why you're getting this.

978
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,610
唐娜  你不用...
Donna, you didn't have to--

979
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,440
我是不用  但哈维需要
I didn't, but Harvey did.

980
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,730
但他不会想到要送你俩礼物
And he won't think to get you two a gift,

981
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:09,420
因为平时都是我
'cause I was always the one

982
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,480
来搞定这种事的  所以...
who took care of things like that, so...

983
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,010
我不知道说什么好了
I don't know what to say.

984
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:14,870
说谢谢就可以
Say thank you.

985
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,290
谢谢你
Thank you.

986
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,480
然后跟我保证
And promise me,

987
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,300
不管我生活中发生什么事
no matter what is going on in my life,

988
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,790
你都不会为跟我说你的好消息而不好意思
you won't feel bad about telling me all the good things in yours.

989
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,620
我保证
I promise.

990
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,700
这是什么
What is this?

991
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,520
一本《新娘》杂志
A copy of Brides Magazine.

992
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,900
放我桌上干嘛
Why is it on my desk?

993
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,660
不然你们要怎么选颜色
How else are you gonna pick your colors?

994
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,690
选颜色
Colors？

995
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,920
选什么颜色
What are colors?

996
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,320
你怎么会懂这些
How do you know what they are?

997
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,590
因为我是个成年男人
Because I'm a grown man.

998
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,280
是吗  可你听着更像个成年女性啊
Really? 'Cause you sound more like a grown woman.

999
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,490
这话很伤人
That's very hurtful.

1000
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,580
我到处找才找到的
I looked everywhere for that issue.

1001
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,630
谢谢  哈维
Thanks, Harvey.

1002
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,550
路上再谢吧
Thank me on the way.

1003
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:02,930
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

1004
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,750
去办你订婚当天就该办的事
To do what we should have done the day you got engaged.

1005
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,880
去看篮球赛
Nets game.

1006
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,960
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

1007
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,620
第一排哦
Front row.

1008
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,920
我的老天
Holy shit.

1009
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,160
Jay-Z会去吗
Is Jay-Z gonna be there?

1010
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,360
会呀  他座位就在我旁边
Yeah, right next to me.

1011
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,320
你旁边  等等  这是给我的礼物
Next to you? Wait, this my gift, hey?

1012
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,150
我不管是谁的礼物  我不能残忍地让Jay-Z挨着你
I don't care whose gift it is. I'm not doing that to Jay-Z.

1013
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,910
好吧  我坐碧昂丝旁边算了
Oh, you know what, I'll just sit next to Beyonc.

1014
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,120
就算我们扯平了
We'll call it a draw.

1015
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,610
得了  不用想了
You know what, never mind.

1016
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,330
我带瑞秋去
I'm taking Rachel.

1017
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,070
是吗  你不如把票给我俩算了
Yeah, well, why don't you just give it to both of us?

1018
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:28,040
等等  那谁留在这儿做你的工作呢
Oh, wait, then who would stay here and do all your work?

1019
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,160
要命  玩笑开太早了吗
Shit. Was that too soon?

1020
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,040
抱歉  兄弟  我们走
Oh, I'm so sorry, bud. Let's go!
