所以这些卵子  就是我唯一的希望

你可以先把施暴的警察都关进监狱

180
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,770
我为什么就没想到这点呢
Now, why didn't I think of that?

不  那样会显得太饥渴了
No, we'll sound desperate.

你今天又是什么说辞  迈克

211
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,750
为什么所有人都在怀疑我
Why is everybody so suspicious of me?

212
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,560
我才进你办公室  什么都还没说

约束警察暴力执法的那边

别担心  他走的时候没有痛苦

230
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,760
他高中毕业了

真是太遗憾了  我简直难以想象

236

他想要的  不过是让这个世界更好一些

237
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,920
这就是我做这份工作的原因

238
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,550
如果我们能让警察暴力执法的案件不再发生
And if we can stop police brutality cases,

239
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,190
那将会是一个很好的开始  对吗

240
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,660
总之
Anyway...

241
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,230

不  我是一名律师
No, a lawyer. 

255
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,440
你以前是湖道生育诊所的吧  医生

好的  我还是会说好几年前
Okay. I would call that years ago.

259
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,740
湖道在财务上遇到了麻烦  而我们没有

260
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,020
再问一下  我能帮你做些什么
How may I help you again?

261
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,360
我们代表当事人劳拉·萨勒诺前来拜访

贵所库存中有她的12个卵子

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,370
实际上  是在我们所替代的
Actually, that was Lake Drive who had them in storage,

264
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,750
湖道生育诊所的库存里
the fertility clinic we replaced.

265
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,080
你说的那家诊所跟贵所在同一幢建筑里
You mean the fertility clinic in the same building, 

266
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,530
用同一个医疗主任  也就是你
with the same medical director... you?

267
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,930
是的
Yes.

268
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,690
你还需要别的什么吗  女士
Is there anything else you might need, ma'am?

269
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,770
那些卵子的地点
The location of the eggs.

270
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,810
合同是跟湖道签的
You see, this contract was with Lake Drive.

271
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,200
自湖道关门之日起就无效了
It was voided the day Lake Drive closed its doors.

272
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,480
不  先生  这合同要求如果你们关门停业
No, sir. This contract required that you contact our client

273
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,340
要事先联系我们的当事人
if ever you were to close your doors.

274
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,780
那些卵子都已经不在了
Well, the eggs are gone.

275
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,850
我们重新开业的时候清理了整个系统
We flushed out the system when we reopened.

276
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,030
那你就等着我们的传票吧
Then you can expect our filing.

277
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,790
等等  等等  我们没做错什么
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wai... We did nothing wrong here.

278
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,250
你可以随便告湖道  但不能告我们
You're welcome to sue Lake Drive, but not us.

279
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,410
不  我们起诉你  针对个人起诉  医生
No, we will be suing you, personally, Doctor.

280
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,920
你掌管一家设施相同
You are in charge of a clinic

281
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,840
医疗主任相同的诊所
with the same facilities and same director?

282
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,720
我猜你是不想让州政府办公室
My guess is you don't want the secretary of state's office

283
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,350
好好查查欺诈转移
looking closely into a fraudulent transfer.

284
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,800
好吧  等下
Okay, hold on.

290
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,600
芝加哥理工大学
for humanitarian reasons.

291
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,930
你是因为失误  卵子到这来了
You're saying the ovum ended up here by mistake?

292
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,430
-是的  湖道送过来的  -你说啥
- Yes, from Lake Drive. - Pardon?

293
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,490
从湖道生育诊所送过来的

295
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,880
你想知道它们现在在哪里

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,350
查查吧
Well, let's see.

297
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,610
是的  它们送到我们的干细胞研究实验室了
Yes, they were transferred to our stem cell research lab.

298
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,680
很好  实验室在哪儿
Good. Where is that?

299
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,450
-实验室在哪  -你在那里是找不到它们的
- Where is that? - Oh, you won't find them still there.

300
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,860
他们已经受精了并且丢销了
No, they've already been fertilized and D&Ded.

301
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,560
丢销
D&Ded?

302
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,460
是的  丢弃并销毁
Yeah, discarded and destroyed.

303
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,030
11个全都是
All 11 of them.

304
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,160
对不起
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,640
等等  应该有12个
Wait, there were 12.

306
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,350
不  11个  一共11个
No, 11, there were 11...

307
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,050
不  一共捐了12个
No, there were 12 donated.

308
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,720
第12个卵子在哪里
Where is the 12th egg?

309
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,130
被标为"保密"了
Ah, it's marked "Confidential."

310
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,330
什么  什么保密
What? What is?

00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,220
卵子
The egg.

312
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,960
你能明白我说的话吗
Can you understand what I'm saying?

313
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,480
有时候我自己都听不清我自己说什么
Sometimes I find it difficult to hear myself.

314
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,790
不  我能听清
No, I can hear you.

315
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,890
可是你们是公共机构啊  医生
But you're a public institution, Doctor;

316
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,760
为什么会标为保密呢
why is it marked confidential?

317
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,610
不  看上去不像下雨的样子
No, it doesn't look like rain.

318
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,920
所以  我的卵子有一个还在
So, one of my eggs still exists,

319
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,330
但是我们不知道在哪里
but we don't know where?

320
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,370
是的  它被列为保密内容了
Yes, it was listed as confidential.

321
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,290
-但是其他的都没了  -是的
- But none of the others were? - No.

322
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,490
他们为什么要藏起来一个
Why would they keep one egg hidden?

323
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,240
病人隐私
Patient confidentiality?

324
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,630
理工大学里的研究员有没有给患者治疗的
Do any of the Poly-Tech researchers see patients?

325
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,780
我不能告诉你  那被列为保密信息了
I can't tell you. It's listed as confidential.

326
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,670
你能不能至少告诉我们
Can you at least tell us

327
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,080
哪些带教医生接诊患者
which teaching doctors see patients?

328

什么
What?

329
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,730
你能告诉我们哪些医生接诊患者吗
Can you tell us which doctors see patients?

330
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,360
谢谢你们
Oh, thank you,

331
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
但是还没到午饭时间呢
but it's not lunchtime yet.

332
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,150
你知道我们是律师吗  医生
Do you know we're lawyers, Doctor?

333
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,080
你说什么
Pardon?

334
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,410
你知道我们是律师吗
Do you know that we're lawyers?

335
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,720
没什么  感谢你的帮助
Never mind. Thanks for your help.

336
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,660

338
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,020
诺伍德医生  你所拥有的一颗卵子
The ovum that you have, Dr. Norwood,

339
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,850
是归我们的客户所有  现在她想把它要回来
it belongs to our client, and she wants it back.

340
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,270
你们有什么证据
What's your evidence of that?

341
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,340
这份合同
This contract.

342
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,240
这上面承认了湖道接收了12颗卵子

344

345
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,180
你们要这颗卵子干什么
And why do you want the ovum?

346
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,560
她需要她的卵子怀孕
She needs her egg back to fertilize it.

347
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,580
很遗憾  这恐怕...
Regrettably, here's the problem...

348
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,970
你已经把卵子摧毁了
You've already destroyed it?

349
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,870
不  我们已经让它受精了
No, we've already fertilized it.

350
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,060
再笑一下
One more smile.

351
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,010
好的

再笑一下
Just one more smile.

如果要我说话就尽管开口
Tell me if you need me to say anything,

356
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,130
因为我站在一旁就很能吓唬人
because I could just stand here being intimidating,

357
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,620
像这样皱着眉头
you know, frowning like this.

358
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,150
很好  很好  保持微笑
Great. That's great. Now, keep smiling.

359
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,820
看着我  头稍微向左偏一点

你不要再骚扰我了
I want you to stop harassing me.

I'm not doing anything.

364
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,060
-你们进了我的店  -别装了  泰德

那上面有你拍的照片
It has your photographs,

366
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,530
我让你拍的我的照片
the photographs I let you take of me.

367
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,160
你把照片放到了...
You linked them to... 

368
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,820
好吧  玛娅  我不知道你在说什么
Okay, Maia, I don't know what the hell you're talking about,

369
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,450
要不你先预约一下...
but why don't you make an appointment...

370
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,100
她想现在和你谈谈
She wants to talk to you now.

371
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,650
这是你的新女友吗
So this is your new girlfriend?

372
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,060
不是  但这没关系
No, but that shouldn't matter.

373
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,910
我不是拉拉  但我也可以是
I mean, I'm not gay, but I could be.

374
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,210
这是骚扰  泰德
It's harassment, Ted.

375
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,720
我是律师  我可以告得你倾家荡产
I'm a lawyer, and I could sue you for everything you have.

376
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,260
你是说这些吗
Oh, you mean all of this?

377
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,950
我们的事已经过去四年了  放手吧
It was four years ago. Get over it.

378
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,920
我已经放手了  我认识了别人
I am over it; I met someone,

379
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,050
不管你觉得我现在是在干什么...
so whatever it is that you think that I'm doing...

380
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,550
{\an8}希望能早点见到你

381
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,740
这些照片只有你有  泰德
You're the only one who had these photos, Ted.

382
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,880
这是推特机器人发的
It's a Twitterbot.

383
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,690
-天啊  -我两年前放上去的
- Oh, Jesus. - I got it up and running two years ago.

384
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,110
只不过现在因为庞氏骗局才有人关注
It's just getting attention now because of the Ponzi scheme.

385
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,160
什么是推特机器人
What's a Twitterbot?

386
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,470
一个可以生成推特消息的程序
It's a program that imitates a Twitter feed.

387
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,360
为什么是对水果罐头感兴趣
That's why the interest in canning fruit?

388
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,910
它被设定表现出某种有特殊癖好的人的特性
It's programed to take on characteristics of hobbyists sites.

389
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,930
增添点个性
Adds personality.

390
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,370
好吧  关掉它
Okay, so turn it off.

391
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,290
如果是你发明了这个机器人  把它关掉
If you invented this bot, turn it off.

392
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,830
如果我关闭了  它也会自我复制
If I try to kill it, it'll just duplicate itself.

393
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,770
它在假扮我
It's pretending to be me.

394
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,240
别理它就行了
So just ignore it.

395
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:28,830
你真是个混蛋
You're an asshole.

396
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,580
是你把我甩了
Hey, you're the one who broke up with me.

397
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,330
要你女朋友去解决吧
Tell your girlfriend to fix it.

398

这样很成熟  玛娅  非常成熟

你们能告诉我卢卡·奎恩女士
And can one of you point me in the direction

408
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,080

懂了
Got it.

415
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,590

来个八盎司的汉堡  多加洋葱

你有多少时间
How long you got?

418
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,440
15分钟  法官今天心情不好
15. Judge is not happy.

419
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,230
做这个要20分钟  还有个非现做的
It'll take 20. I got a backup.

420
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,080
不是吧
Oh, come on.

421
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,020
这不是法律  是汉堡  做汉堡需要时间
Hey, it's not justice, it's burgers; they take time.

422
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,510
多加洋葱和胡椒
Extra onions, peppers?

423
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,570
当然
Of course.

424
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,740
算了  迈克
Forget it, Mike.

425
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,380
你在这等了我一整天吗
So, what, you've been waiting in here all day for me to come in?

426
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,730
是  你的魅力无人能挡
Yep, your charm is that irresistible.

427
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,780
你想知道我在想什么吗
You want to know what I think?

428
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,700
迫不及待想知道
Can't wait.

429
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,460
我觉得你迫不及待要在见我一面
I think you couldn't wait to see me again,

430
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,580
所以你的汉堡已经切成两半了
and that's why the burger's already cut in half.

431
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,820
被你发现了
You got me.

432
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,390
这可真是个坏习惯  你说呢
This is a bad habit, isn't it?

433
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,330
你挑逗我
You teasing me,

434
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,340
我笑一笑  再挑逗回去
me grinning and teasing you back?

435
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,320
很容易
It's easy.

436
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,240
那什么不容易
As opposed to?

437
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,820
实话
The truth?

438
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,830
有点意思  继续
This should be interesting. Go.

439
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,700
去年  我看了心理医生
Last year, I went to see a, uh, therapist.

440
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,680
吉尔伯特医生
Dr. Gilbert.

441
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,830
因为我恋爱从来不会超过
My problem was that my relationships never lasted

442
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,010
三个星期
more than three weeks.

443
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,170
我想知道是我的问题还是她们的问题
I wanted to know if the problem was me or them.

444
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,740
那肯定是她们的了
Oh, it has to be them.

445
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,760
吉尔伯特医生说因为我的生活太过轻松
Well, Dr. Gilbert said that the ease of my life

446
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,980
导致我总是浅尝辄止
had made me treat things superficially,

447
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,540
所以我需要从我最爱的东西开始
and that what I needed to do was refrain

448
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,470
控制我自己
from the thing that I loved the most

449
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,090
保持一整年
for a full year.

450
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,390
真是胡扯
God, this is such shit.

451
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,150
不  我说的每个字都是真的
No, every word I'm telling you is the truth.

452
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,070
三月十四日  晚上八点半
At 8:30 p.m., on March 14th,

453
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,680
这一年就结束了
the year will be up.

454
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,880
所以你在找一个
And you're looking for someone

455
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,270
和你分享这段深刻经历的人
to share this deep experience with you?

456
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,270
没错  你尽管笑吧
Yeah. Laugh if you will,

457
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,090
我需要一个女人
but I need a woman 

458
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,340
会喜欢我所...
who is able to enjoy what I have...

459
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,680
一个能分享你的床
Someone to share your bed with,

460
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,240
让你知道真爱的意义的人吗
someone to show you the true meaning of love?

461
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,660
不  天哪  才不要
No, God, no.

462
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,050
我在找一个可以在斯库特蛋奶冻店里
No, I'm looking for someone to share a milkshake

463
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,700
和我分享奶昔的人
at Scooter's Frozen Custard.

464
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,280
这一年绝对很难熬
No, been a very long, hard year.

465
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,080
那家店的奶昔真是绝了
God, they are good.

466
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,740
性不过一时欢愉  但波士顿风味奶昔...
Sex is transient, but a Boston Shake...

467
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,300
所以你是邀请我吗
Okay, am I being invited?

468
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,390
正是
Yeah.

469
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,760
下周二
Next Tuesday.

470
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,110
然后我们就可以来一炮了
Afterwards we could have sex.

471
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,820
这是什么
What's this?

472
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,240
这是
It's a subpoena 

473
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,310
司法部给我和律所发的传票
authorized by the D.O.J. for me and my firm.

474
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,260
你今天来就是为了这个
So is this why you came in here today?

475
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,310
没错
Yes.

476
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,730
科林  我找你
As fascinating as I find you, Colin,

477
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,980
就是想知道迈克·克里斯特瓦的目的
I need to know what Mike Kresteva's up to.

478
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,170
克里斯特瓦搞的
This is from Kresteva?

479
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,340
是啊  怎么了
Yeah. Why?

480
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,760
他刚被分配负责警察暴力相关的案件
Well, he was just given the police brutality study.

481
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,160
我知道  但他为什么盯上我们
Yes. So why is he after us?

482
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,140
不知道
I don't know.

483
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,180
我会查清楚的
I'll check it out.

484
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,720
谢谢你的汉堡
Thanks for the burger.

485
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,720
不用
You're welcome.

486
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,470
你出卖我  迈克
You sold me out, Mike.

487
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,420
我想我帮上忙了
Okay, I think I helped here.

488
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,100
-那个推特账号吗  -是的
- With the Twitter account? - Yeah.

489
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,040
刚才是你第一次扇别人耳光吗
Was that the first time you ever slapped anyone?

490
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,360
大概是吧
Yeah, I guess it was.

491
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,420
我联系了推特管理员  告诉他们
Anyway, I contacted Twitter and told them

492
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,830
是推特机器人在冒充你
it was a Twitterbot imitating you,

493
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,930
他们冻结了那个账户  之后会再核实身份
and they froze it until they review it.

494
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,890
太棒了
That's great.

495
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,330
我都没想到还有这个办法
I didn't even realize you could do that.

496
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,330
我也是
I didn't either.

497
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,890
劳拉  问题是...
The, uh, problem, Laura, is...

498
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,680
仅剩的卵子也已经受精了
the last remaining ova has already been fertilized.

499
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,610
是谁
By who?

500
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,940
这就是问题所在
That's the question.

501
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,040
我们不知道
We don't know.

502
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,150
我们查出它被存放在芝加哥理工大学的
We located it at Chicago Poly-Tech,

503
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,210
遗传学实验室
in the genetics lab,

504
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,510
我们会将他们告上法庭
and we're bringing them to court.

505
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,960
这个案子是不错  不过...
There might be a good case here, but...

506
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,310
你想为此打官司吗
do you want to fight it?

507
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,740
毕竟你知道孩子的生父已无从选择
Knowing that you won't be able to choose the genetic father.

508
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,490
你的卵子也已被他受精
Your ova has already been fertilized by someone.

509
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,710
一个你可能与之对簿公堂的人
Someone you may have to fight.

510
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,600
搞什么鬼
What a load of shit.

511
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,940
霍夫女士  每次见面都这么愉快
Ms. Hoff, always good to see you.

512
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,880
她真的不在乎父亲是谁吗
She really doesn't care who the father is?

513
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,850
劳拉  让律师处理
Laura, this should be between the lawyers.

514
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,000
我猜你是代表整个家庭咯
My guess is you're representing the family?

515
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,940
我代表受精卵的拥有者
Mm, I'm representing the owners of the fertilized embryo.

516
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,780
不  你只代表这颗受精卵的
No, you're representing the co-owner

517
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,090
共同拥有者之一
of the fertilized embryo.

518
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,610
我们则代表另一位
We are representing the other co-owner.

519
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,820
她卖出卵子的那一刻就已经放弃了所有权
She abandoned ownership when she sold her eggs.

520
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,890
但有合同为证  她保留了所有权
Contractually, she retained ownership.

521
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,370
我的客户对那份合同完全不知情
My clients knew nothing of that contract.

522
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,650
但这也否认不了合同的存在
That doesn't negate that contract.

523
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,550
对于我的客户而言  就是如此
As far as my clients are concerned, it does.

524
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,700
你应该去告致使合同无效的人...
Your beef is with whoever voided the contract...

525
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,490
还好吗
Everything all right?

526
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,600
没事  我只想看看父亲是谁
Yeah, yeah, I just want to see who the dad is.

527
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,050
他会坐在被告席对吗
He'll be on the other side, right?

528
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,830
是的
I think so.

529
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,170
下一个进那扇门的人
The next person through those doors

530
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,660
就是我孩子的父亲
will be the father of my child.

531
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,350
下一个进那扇门的男性就是我孩子的父亲
The next male through those doors will be the father of my child.

532
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,980
我的客户会支付
My client is willing to pay

533
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,480
-你们寻找另一位卵子捐赠者的费用  -真大方
- for you to find another egg donor. - How gracious.

534
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,510
-他们对现在这个就很满意  -拜托
- They are happy with this one. - Oh, come on.

535
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,280
他们还有其他机会  而她只有这一个卵子了
They have other opportunities. She just has this one egg.

536
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,340
你的委托人尚可以让很多卵子受精
Your client can fertilize a lot of eggs.

537
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,720
而且我们愿意支付18500美元
And we're willing to offer $18,500

538
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,100
给其他卵子捐赠者
to pay for another egg donor.

539
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,720
这家人花了很多年时间才找到一位适格捐赠者
This family has spent years looking for a donor.

540
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,630
我们会付钱让他们去找另一位的
And we will pay for them to find another.

541
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,050
为什么一定要是这一个呢
Why does this one matter?

542
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,140
你在想什么
What do you think?

543
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,170
我觉得那就是我孩子的父亲
I think that's the father to my baby.

544
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,640
这场官司你想继续打下去吗
Do you want to keep fighting?

545
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,870
我打算抚养一个孩子并送他去上大学
There's a kid I plan to raise and send to college.

546
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,320
18年后  他或者她会是我的孩子
18 years from now, he or she will be mine.

547
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,220
我才是抚养他长大成人的最佳人选
I don't see anybody else raising him.

548
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,610
很好  我们就需要你这个决心
Good. That's what we need to hear.

549
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,820
全体起立
All rise!

550
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,970
请各位就坐
Let's all take our seats please.

551

我读过你们的案情陈述了
I've read your briefs.

552
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,980
我知道双方对此案热情都很高
I know there's a lot of passion...

553
00:23:52,830 --> 00:24:01,560
{\an8}蒂莫西·斯坦内克法官  家事法庭

554
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,790
让我看下你的手机
Let me see your phone.

555
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,320
不是我的手机  法官阁下
It's... it's not my phone, Your Honor.

556
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,610
是这块表
It's, uh... it's this watch.

557
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,440
让我看一下
Let me see it.

558
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,610
好的
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,980
这只是个
It's just a... just a...

560
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,280
该...  法官阁下
Oh, sh... Your Honor?

561
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,100
原告希望
The, uh, plaintiff would like

562
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,080
对本案的卵子植入手术施行紧急禁止是吗
an emergency injunction against implantation?

563
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,270
是的  法官阁下  卵子的所有权上有争议
Yes, Your Honor. There is some question about the ownership.

564
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,790
原告在以两万美元售出
The plaintiff relinquished ownership

565
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,240
她的卵子之时就已经放弃了所有权
when she sold her ova for $20,000.

566
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,170
不  她在卵子售出五年后拥有
No, she has contractual control

567
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,270
契约处置权
after five years.

568
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,630
我的委托人对那份合同毫不知情
My clients knew nothing about that contract.

569
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,510
如果原告把她的车抵押给了第三方
If the plaintiff had loaned her car to a third party,

570
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,530
而第三方把这辆车卖给了我们
and that third party sold the car to us,

571
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,650
那么原告所提出的任何争议
the plaintiff's disagreement

572
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,210
都应针对那个第三方  而不是我们
is with the third party, not with us.

573
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,090
我们讨论的不是车
It's not a car,

574
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,770
法官阁下  这是一枚胚胎
Your Honor, this is an embryo.

575
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,550
一枚双亲共同拥有的胚胎
An embryo that is co-owned by two parents.

576
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,340
并不是双亲  那使其个人化了
Not two parents. That personalizes...

577
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,510
我的委托人的DNA
My client's DNA...

578
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,910
好了  好了  好了
Okay, okay, okay.

579
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,690
我将批准一份针对这项手术施行的
I will grant a temporary injunction against implantation

580
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,970
临时紧急禁止令以便让双方有时间呈上证据
merely to give both of you time to present evidence.

581
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,950
-请准备好证据于明天回到  -法官阁下
- Please return tomorrow ready to... - Your Honor,

582
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,100
我的委托人已经计划于下周前往英国
my clients have a... trip planned to England next week.

583
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,740
如果这案子对他们很重要  他们会留下来的
If this matters to them, they'll stay.

584
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,930
休庭
Adjourned.

585
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,390
抱歉  法官阁下  我能把手表拿回来了吗
Excuse me. Your Honor, can I have my watch back?

586

{\an8}玛娅·林德尔  "丑闻之女"被解雇了

「美国新闻」上有篇文章坚称

595
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,130
什么  没有  为什么这么说

我被解雇了吗
Am I being fired?

603

我甚至都不知道你是谁
I barely even know who you are.

604
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,940

我刚又收到个新谷歌快讯

611
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,470

00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,460
不必谢我
No thanks are necessary.

618
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,710
我是被传唤的
I was subpoenaed.

619
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,740
-我别无选择  -总之
- I had no choice. - Well,

620
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,660
还是谢谢你
thank you, anyway.

621
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,980
我昨天是否去过你办公室
Did I visit your office yesterday?

622
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,370
-是的  -我是否有问你
- You did. - Did I ask you about

623
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,890
关于芝加哥警察暴力执法案件的事宜
police brutality cases in Chicago?

624
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,190
问了
You did.

625
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,050
那我是否有问你关于
And did I ask you for suggestions

626
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,940
如何解决这一问题的建议
on how to address this issue?

627
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,460
是的  你问了
Yes, you did.

628
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,880
而你选择不予回答
And you chose not to answer.

629
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,040
我不确定你的动机
I wasn't certain of your motives.

630
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,960
我的
My...

631
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,510
我的动机能有什么不对
What could be wrong with my motives?

632
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,100
我觉得你经常撒谎
I think you tend to lie.

633
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,680
你们律所靠警察暴力执法案件赚了很多钱
Your firm makes a lot of money on these police brutality cases.

634
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,590
这是提问吗
Is that a question?

635
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,060
是的
Yeah, it is.

636
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,150
"很多钱"是多少
Define "A lot of money."

637
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,630
占你们律所年收入的百分之三十
30% of its annual income.

638
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,590
我刚入职
Well, I'm new to the firm.

639
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,120
这种事情你还是问博斯曼先生比较好
I think it's best that you ask Mr. Boseman.

640
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,610
当我问你  你们律所如何看待
When I asked you about your firm's attitude

641
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,030
警察暴力执法时
about police brutality,

642
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,270
你是不是说问题在于
did you not say that the problem was

643
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,050
库克县人民仇视非裔美国人
the people of Cook County hated African-Americans?

644
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,630
需要我把问题复述一遍吗
Would you like me to repeat the question?

645
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,870
不
No.

646
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,400
是的
Yes.

647
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,800
当我问你
When I asked you

648
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,130
你们律所动机是否纯正时  你是不是说
if your firm's motives were pure, did you not say

649
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,250
问题在于库克县人民仇视非裔美国人
the problem is that Cook County hated African-Americans

650
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,220
且随意看待黑人生命
and treated black lives carelessly?

651
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,120
没有
No.

652
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,090
你没说过吗
You did not say that?

653
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,550
没有  我从未说过这样的话
No, I said nothing like it.

654
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,670
你的意思是我的会议记录并不正确吗
Are you saying that my notes from our meeting are incorrect?

655
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,190
你的会议记录错得一塌糊涂
Your notes on our meeting are bizarrely incorrect.

656
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,960
那你能告诉我这上面
Well, would you be kind enough to show me

657
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,890
哪里写错了
where I was mistaken?

658
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,490
你走进我的办公室
Well, you came into my office,

659
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,530
谈了谈设立你们专案组的性质
you explained the nature of your task force,

660
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,160
又说了你儿子的事情  然后就没了
we spoke about your son, and that was it.

661
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,170
我不清楚你是从哪里弄来的记录
I don't know where you got this quote,

662
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,360
但你说的  没有一个字
but there's not a single word of it

663
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,640
是准确的
that is accurate.

664
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,730
是吗
Really?

665
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,040
我们有谈到我儿子吗
And we spoke about my son?

666
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,240
为什么会谈到我儿子
Why would we speak about my son?

667
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,860
我问他近况如何
I asked you how he was.

668
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,270
我那已经去世的儿子
My son who died?

669
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,080
你...居然问他近况如何
You... asked me how he was?

670
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,500
是的  我不知道他已经过世了
Yes. I didn't know that he had passed.

671
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,420
我在你办公室呆了多久
How long was I in your office?

672
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,380
大概有六分钟
Six minutes, approximately.

673
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,810
你是说我把这其中的大部分时间
And you're saying that I spent the majority of that time

674
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,540
都用来谈我儿子
talking about my son?

675
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,290
没错
Yes.

676
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,730
真的吗
Really?

677
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,200
真的
Yes.

678
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,960
他在给我们下套
He's setting us up.

679
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,080
为什么
Why?

680
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,840
他想要减少警察暴力执法案件的数量
He wants to reduce the number of police brutality cases,

681
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,970
但不是通过减少警察施暴
but not by reducing police brutality...

682
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,340
而是减少立案的数量
by reducing the number of cases.

683
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,910
他想让我们无法起诉
He wants to reduce us? 

684
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,240
但这不可能  不是吗
But he can't, can he?

685
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,440
你那个助理联邦检察官怎么说
What does your AUSA say?

686
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,940
他的确会说谎
Yeah, he lies.

687
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,400
你上司知道吗
Does your boss know that?

688
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,640
所有人都会说谎
Well, everyone lies.

689
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,540
但克里斯特瓦是对我们的事说谎
But Kresteva is lying about us.

690
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,860
他把子虚乌有的罪名强加给我们
He's saying we said things that we didn't.

691
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,210
好吧  我只能这样帮你
All right, here's what I can do.

692
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,920
我能帮你和助理总检察长威尔伯·丁肯
I could argue your case to the assistant attorney general,

693
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,030
说一下这件事
Wilbur Dincon.

694
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,170
他掌控克里斯特瓦的日程
He controls Kresteva's agenda.

695
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,280
你是认真的吗
You're serious?

696
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,820
是啊  怎么了
Yeah. Why?

697
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,140
我也不知道
I don't know.

698
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,400
你太善良了
You're being nice.

699
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,480
我正喝着酒
Well, I'm drinking.

700
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,880
我喝酒时就善良
I'm nice when I drink.

701
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,950
是吗
Really?

702
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,460
我可坏了
I'm mean.

703
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,670
要来我家吗
You want to go back to my place?

704
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,290
-不要  -为什么
- No. - Why?

705
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,440
这看起来会像是在做交易
That would make this seem like a quid pro quo,

706
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,820
你不会希望变成那样的
and you don't want that.

707
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,570
-为什么啊  -因为
- Why don't I want that? - Because,

708
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,770
这是我第一次觉得你是个好人
for the first time, you seem like a good guy.

709
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,990
别毁了它
Don't ruin it.

710
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,170
不管怎么说
Anyway,

711
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,360
这也算一次奶昔之约了
we have a date for a milkshake.

712
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,690
该死  真不想当好人
Fuck, I hate being a good guy.

713
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:33,900
可以继续了
You may continue.

714
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,150
谢谢您  法官阁下
Thank you, Your Honor.

715
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,140
诺伍德医生  我们来谈谈这个胚胎
Dr. Norwood, let's turn to this embryo.

716
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,190
请稍等   法官阁下
Excuse me, Your Honor.

717
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,190
诺伍德下周也要去英国
Norwood is going to England next week, too.

718
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,470
跟海特一家一样
Just like the Haights.

719
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,130
律师  你还有什么要问这名证人的吗
Counselor, do you have something more for this witness?

720
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,080
是的
Yes, I do.

721
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,460
你下周是不是要去英国  诺伍德医生
Are you traveling to England next week, Dr. Norwood?

722
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,900
反对  法官阁下
Objection, Your Honor.

723
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,010
问医生的个人行程有那么重要吗
Are the doctor's travel arrangements really necessary?

724
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,410
我不知道  重要吗
I don't know. Are they?

725
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,440
-重要  法官阁下  -重要
- They are, Your Honor. - They are.

726
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,250
你去英国  是要把这个胚胎
Are you going to England to implant

727
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,710
植入海特女士体内吗
this embryo into Mrs. Haight?

728
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,140
-是的  -为什么是在英国
- Yes. - And why in England?

729
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,530
而不是在美国
Why not in America?

730
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,390
英国批准这种手术的实施
Well, it's a procedure that's approved of in England.

731
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,540
所以这一手术在美国属非法吗
So this is a procedure that is illegal in America?

732
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,060
话倒不至于这么说
I wouldn't put it that way.

733
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,570
那你会怎么说呢
What way would you put it?

734
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,530
在美国还没有获批
It's not approved of in America.

735
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,280
好  你不如详细解释一下这个手术吧
Okay, well, why don't you explain this procedure.

736
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,580
海特夫人携带亚急性坏死性脑脊髓病遗传标记
Mrs. Haight has the genetic marker for Leigh syndrome.

737
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,140
这是一种会导致新生儿死亡的
It's a severe neurological disorder that results

738
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,000
严重的神经障碍疾病
in the death of the child.

739
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,810
英国允许实施的治疗方法
The procedure considered permissible in England

740
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,500
叫做DNA线粒体替换法
is called mitochondrial DNA replacement.

741
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,490
那是什么
What is that?

742
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,200
请用最简单平实的语言
And, please, explain it to me like

743
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,900
解释给我听
I'm an eight-year-old.

744
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,510
萨勒诺女士的胚胎
Ms. Salano's embryo

745
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,390
没有亚急性坏死性脑脊髓病的迹象  很健康
has no trace of Leigh's syndrome; it's clean.

746
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,020
我们从她的胚胎中提取基因
We take genes from that embryo

747
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,730
再把那些基因植入新的受精卵
and place those genes in a new fertilized egg...

748
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,340
这个胚胎是海特夫人的
the embryo belonging to Mrs. Haight.

749
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,840
这样海特夫人就有了一枚没有
In that way, Mrs. Haight has an embryo

750
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,340
亚急性坏死性脑脊髓病的胚胎
without Leigh's syndrome.

751
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,380
那第一个胚胎会怎样
What happens with the first embryo?

752
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,370
萨勒诺女士的胚胎
That one, Ms. Salano's embryo,

753
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,000
会做出遗传贡献  就是这样
is used for its genetic contribution, that's all.

754
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,260
然后它就被毁掉了
Then it's destroyed?

755
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,750
它没有被毁掉  而是无法再用于生育了
It's not destroyed. It's no longer viable.

756
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,570
他们不想要我的孩子
They don't want my baby.

757
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,100
只是想用我的一部分基因
They just want to use some of my genes

758
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,960
来使他们的孩子健康完整
to make their baby whole?

759
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,510
女士  请让你的律师来质询
Please, ma'am, let your lawyers ask the questions.

760
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,890
你可以回答她的问题吗  医生
Can you answer her question, Doctor?

761
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,210
问题不在于是谁的孩子
It's not a question of this baby or that.

762
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,870
当下的一切都只是可能性
Everything is a potentiality at this point.

763
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,760
海特夫妇的潜在胚胎需要植入
The Haights' potential embryo needs to be made whole

764
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,650
另一枚胚胎的遗传物质  才是完整的
with the genetic material from this other embryo.

765
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,960
所以你们通过拿走她的胚胎  攫取基因
So you would destroy Laura's chance of creating life

766
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,200
剥夺了劳拉孕育生命的机会
by taking her embryo and raiding it for its genes?

767
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,670
我不喜欢"攫取"这个词
I don't like the word "Raiding."

768
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,340
好的  我明白了
Okay, I get it.

769
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,710
我们现在讨论的内容是合同法的特殊领域
We are in some very odd areas of contract law now.

770
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,540
不  这事关生命  法官阁下
No, this is about life, Your Honor.

771
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,370
事实上并不是
Actually, no.

772
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,670
现存的胚胎是财产
The existing embryo is property.

773
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,320
唯一的问题就是
The only question is:

774
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,140
它的所有权属于谁
who does it belong to?

775
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,390
是萨勒诺女士还是海特先生
Does Ms. Solano own it or Mr. Haight?

776
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,350
你们明天呈上证据  我们再判决
You bring me evidence tomorrow, and we'll decide.

777
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,670
天呐  我讨厌这样
Oh, God, I hate this.

778
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,500
怎么了
Okay, so what?

779
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,100
雷迪克&博斯曼&科斯达律所
The law firm Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad

780
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,790
感到愤愤不平
is feeling aggrieved.

781
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,850
他们觉得专案组在不公平地针对他们
They feel like the task force is unfairly targeting them.

782
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,910
我猜这说的是我
I guess that means me.

783
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,340
是的  我觉得是这样
Yeah, I guess it does.

784
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,510
你在针对他们吗  迈克
Are you targeting them, Mike?

785
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,820
不  我针对的是警察暴力执法
No, I'm targeting police brutality.

786
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,710
通过针对起诉这类案件最多的律所
By targeting the law firm suing the most?

787
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,440
没错  这将会是统计数据上最伟大的进步
That's right. It'll show the greatest progress for the stats.

788
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,360
我不知道这有什么不妥  科林
I'm not sure what the problem is here, Colin.

789
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,880
迈克有他的策略  他需要实施它
Mike's got a strategy. He needs to pursue it.

790
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,170
我只是在担心这家律所的雇员都是非裔美国人
I'm just worried that it's an all African-American firm.

791
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,270
都是黑人
It's all black?

792
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,020
并非都是黑人
It's not all black.

793
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,510
戴安·洛哈特是白人
Diane Lockhart is Caucasian.

794
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,810
去针对一家雇员全是非裔美国人的律所
It just seems like it would be a public relations disaster

795
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,720
似乎会给公共关系带来灾难
to go after an all African-American firm.

796
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:01,970
尤其是试图阻止起诉警察暴力执法
Especially to try to curb police brutality suits.

797
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,740
我们不仅是因为警察暴力执法案件而针对他们
We're not just after them for police brutality.

798
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,020
还因为什么
Okay, what else?

799
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,490
我在寻找线索
I'm developing leads.

800
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,060
要么快点找
Well, develop them fast,

801
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,260
要么放弃
or drop it.

802
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,350
你有很多回报更丰厚的目标
You have a lot juicer targets.

803
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,590
是  先生  谢谢
Yes, sir. Thank you.

804
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,250
这是假新闻
It's fake news.

805
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,250
关于我的文章
The articles about me?

806
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,040
没错  骗点击率的
Yes. It's click bait.

807
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,800
大家对你父母的庞氏骗局不满
People are angry about your parents' Ponzi scheme,

808
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,220
所以这类文章有很多读者
so there's an audience for these kind of articles.

809
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,060
这是我前男友做的吗
It's from my ex-boyfriend?

810
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,410
可能来自另一个网络机器人
Probably from another bot.

811
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,040
它引用了你发布的被解雇的推文
It quotes your tweets about being fired...

812
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,790
不是我发布的  是假推特发的
Not mine. The fake tweets.

813
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,470
对  它把那些推文重新包装
Right. It repackages those tweets

814
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,050
并引用在文章中
and quotes them in an article.

815
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,990
所以  我们怎么阻止这件事
So, I mean, how do we stop this?

816
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,470
这是什么
What is this?

817
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,630
临限令
A T.R.O.

818
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:44,830
什么
A what?

819
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,720
临时限制令
A temporary restraining order.

820
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,140
库克县巡回法庭签发的
By order of the Cook County Circuit Court,

821
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,560
你必须立刻停止发布
you must immediately cease generating false news

822
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,990
关于玛娅·林德尔的假新闻
about Maia Rindell

823
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,500
直到就此案召开听证会
until a hearing can be held on the merits of her case against you.

824
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,360
你不怎么懂电脑吧
You don't know much about computers, do you?

825
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,260
-我懂的足够用了  -库克县巡回法庭
- I know enough. - Cook County Circuit Court

826
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,860
只对伊利诺伊州有管辖权
has jurisdiction only in Illinois.

827
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,560
我的加密软件通过美国20个州
I bounce my encrypted software through servers in 20 states,

828
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,640
墨西哥和日本的服务器运行
Mexico and Japan.

829
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,790
库克县巡回法庭无权强制执行这项命令
Cook County Circuit Court can't enforce this order.

830
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,760
无管辖权
No jurisdiction.

831
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,030
我们被法律制度限制住了
We've hit the limits of the legal system.

832
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,540
你是说我们束手无策了吗
You're telling me there's really nothing we can do?

833
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,040
-没有合法方式  -等等  你是想告诉我
- Not legally. - Wait, you trying to tell me

834
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,570
有什么不合法的办法吗
there's something I can do illegally?

835
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,620
不是
No.

836
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,700
-我听着就是这个意思  -我也是
- Sounded like that to me. - Me, too.

837
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,320
好了  这种事我不能参与
Okay, look, I can't be a party to whatever this is.

838
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,270
我得走了
I have to go.

839
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,670
你们有什么想法吗
Do you have any ideas?

840
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,600
{\an8}新消息  来自布莱恩
老兄  真的假的

841
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,690

843
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,750
慢点说
Hey, just slow down.

844
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,340
当然是假的  老天
Of course it's not real. Jesus!

845
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,570
这种问题你还用问我
How could you even ask me that?

846
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,820
好了  关键词"妓女"  "肛栓"  "BDSM"
Here we go. Keywords: "Hooker," "Butt plug" And "BDSM."

847
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,570
还有吗
Anything else?

848
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,800
"束缚"怎么样
How about "Leash"?

849
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,890
完美
Perfect.

850
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,050
你来发送吧
You want to do the honors?

851

这不是真的
It's not true.

852
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,860
全都是假的
None of this stuff is true.

853
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,500
孩子  你得处理好这事
Son, you got to take care of this.

854
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
-都已经传开了  -都是假的  罗杰
- It's right here. - That's fake news, Roger.

855
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,800
我不在乎是什么  我脸书首页都是这个
I don't care what it is; it was on my Facebook page.

856
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,820
"酒品店4.5万美元神秘失踪"
"$45,000 missing from liquor store."

857
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,850
这根本说不通
That doesn't even make sense...

858
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,280
我在这工作  又不在酒品店工作
I work here, I don't work at a liquor store.

859
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,070
但是你的名字和照片  你看
But it's your name and your picture. Look.

860
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,720
罗杰  这随便一个黑客都能做到  我也能
Roger, any hacker could do that; I could do that.

861
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,570
别开除我
Please don't let me go.

862
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,390
你得去找警方谈谈  泰德
You got to go talk to the police, Ted.

863
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,170
据说他们正在找你
It says that they're looking for you.

864
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,550
海特先生  当诺伍德医生
Mr. Haight, when Dr. Norwood

865
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,900
找到吻合胚胎后  你就付了治疗的费用
found this matching embryo, and you paid for the treatment,

866
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,360
你付了多少钱
how much did you pay?

867
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,890
总共九千美金
All in, $9,000.

868
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,330
你付钱的时候
And when you paid that amount,

869
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,490
有没有怀疑过这个卵子
did you have any reason to believe that that egg

870
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,240
并不属于芝加哥理工大学
didn't belong to Chicago Poly-Tech?

871
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,820
-没有  -法官阁下
- No. - Your Honor,

872
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,870
我的当事人受到"无辜购买方"规则的保护
my clients are protected by the "Innocent purchasers" doctrine.

873
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,460
即便卵子本不该抵达芝加哥理工大学
Even if that egg shouldn't have arrived at Chicago Poly-Tech,

874
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,210
我的当事人也是合法公平地进行购买
it was purchased legally and fairly by my clients.

875
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,850
洛哈特女士  你有何回应
Ms. Lockhart, how do you respond?

876
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,750
法官阁下
Your Honor,

877
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,990
如果是我当事人的车被偷了
if my client's car were stolen

878
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,510
海特一家要征求你的允许...
and the Haights were asking your permission...

879
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,570
我的天
Oh, dear God.

880
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,970
律师  这不是被盗车辆
Counselor, this is not a stolen car.

881
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,010
不是什么东西都能够拿来类比的
At a certain point, analogy fails us.

882
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:28,120
我很反感我居然要用物权法
I'm disgusted that I have to use property law

883
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,440
来裁定生命的归属问题
to decide issues of life.

884
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,520
但是
But...

885
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,060
"无辜购买方"规则适用于本案
the "Innocent purchaser" doctrine holds.

886
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,130
胚胎属于海特一家
The embryo belongs to the Haights.

887
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,450
我很抱歉  非常抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

888
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,560
你毁了我的生活
You're ruining my life.

889
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,910
出去  泰德
Get out of here, Ted.

890
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,730
否则我报警了
I'll call the cops.

891
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,120
你报啊  你真是个贱人  玛娅
Yeah, just try it. You are such a bitch, Maia.

892
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,070
不好意思
Excuse me.

893
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,190
你有什么想告诉我们的吗
Is there something you want to tell us?

894
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,920
跟你无关
This isn't about you.

895
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,490
事实上  如果与玛娅有关  就与我有关
Actually, if it's about Maia, it's about me.

896
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,370
你还想说什么吗
Anything else you want to say?

897
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,040
你撤下那些文章  我就把我的撤掉
You drop your news articles, and I'll drop mine.

898
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,830
好
Okay.

899
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,960
好
Okay.

900
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,040
你可以走了
Your business is done here.

901
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,920
谢谢你  博斯曼先生
Thank you, Mr. Boseman.

902
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,970
不客气
No problem.

903
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,040
在这家律所  我们会为同伴挺身而出  玛娅
At this firm, we stand up for each other, Maia.

904
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,960
你还好吧
You all right?

905
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,720
她简直伤心欲绝
She was pretty inconsolable.

906
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,350
我知道
I know.

907
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,700
打击太大了
It's tough.

908
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,330
你后悔不生孩子吗
Do you regret not having children?

909
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,510
有时候会
Sometimes.

910
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,460
不常有
Not often.

911
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,970
有时候是什么时候
When are the sometimes?

912
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,910
跟我丈夫在一起的时候
With my husband.

913
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,190
现在我们想生太迟了  但是...
I mean, it's too late for us now, but, uh...

914
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,000
有时候看着他时我会想
I look at him and I wonder what...

915
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,260
他的儿子会是什么样的
you know, what his son would be like.

916
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,130
我女儿会是什么样的
Or my daughter.

917
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,330
说来有趣
Yeah. It's interesting.

918
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,490
大多说人认为我不想要孩子
Most people think I didn't want kids,

919
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,310
所以工作成了我生活的全部
and that's why I made my work my life.

920
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,140
但他们不知道的是  事实恰恰相反
What they don't realize, it's... it's really just the opposite.

921
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,600
是啊
Yes.

922
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,250
工作
Work.

923
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,850
工作让一切有意义
It's what gives it all meaning.

924
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,070
但唯一不同的是
The only difference is...

925
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,230
孩子活得比你长
kids survive you.

926
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,220
这并不总是件好事
That's not always a good thing.

927
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,780
{\an8}库尔特

928
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,760
你还好吗  洛哈特女士
You all right, Ms. Lockhart?

929
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,150
英国
England.

930
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,470
人类受精与胚胎管理局
The Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority?

931
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,990
英国的生育监管部门
Britain's fertility watchdog.

932
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,060
-你给他们打电话了  -是的
- And you called them? - We did.

933
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,000
怎么做到的
How?

934
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,830
我们拨打了区号44  然后拨了电话号
We dialed 44 and then the number.

935
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,480
我是问你们到底是怎么
I mean how in the hell did you manage

936
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,960
把他们牵扯进来的
to drag them into this?

937
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,980
不同的国家有不同的规则
Different country, different rules apply.

938
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,750
英国法律规定卵子的售价
British law says you can't sell your eggs

939
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,160
不能高于750英镑
for more than 750 pounds.

940
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,120
劳拉却将她的卵子卖了两万美元
Laura sold hers for $20,000.

941
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,750
所以你把我们搞惨了
So you just fucked us over.

942
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,520
根据英国法律  这些卵子的销售是无效的
Under British law, the sale of these eggs is invalid.

943
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,470
这有什么区别吗  法官阁下
What difference does that make, Your Honor?

944
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,600
您都已经对这个胚胎的所有权作出判决了
You've already ruled on the ownership of the embryo.

945
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,860
为了将它带到英国进行手术
For the express purpose of taking it to England for this procedure,

946
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,500
而这如今是被禁止的
which they have now been forbidden from doing.

947
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,000
尼古拉斯·海特  考特妮·海特  就我理解
Nicholas Haight, Courtney Haight, I, uh, take it

948
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,710
你们不会再前往英国了对吗
that your sojourn to England is no longer happening?

949
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,080
没错  法官阁下
That is correct, Your Honor.

950
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,950
你的当事人想要如何处理胚胎
And what do your clients want to do with the embryo?

951
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,990
他们想要销毁它
They would like to have it destroyed.

952
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,470
让我
Let-let me, uh,

953
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,640
想想能否找到你们律师喜欢的表达方法
see if I can put this in a way that you lawyers will like.

954
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,450
你的当事人买了一辆偷来的车
Your clients bought a stolen car,

955
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,250
而现在  不去让
and now, rather than see it

956
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,130
它的合法车主驾驶它
driven by its rightful owner,

957
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,850
他们想要丢弃销毁它
they want to bring it to the dump and flatten it.

958
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,440
是海特先生提供了受精卵的精子
Mr. Haight fertilized the egg.

959
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,090
这胚胎有一半属于他  他不想要这个小孩
It's half his. He doesn't want this child.

960
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,110
但我想要
But I do,

961
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:46,990
法官阁下
Your Honor.

962
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,150
好的
Right.

963
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,570
这就是分歧所在
And there's the rub.

964
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,050
你的当事人不需要这个胚胎  霍夫女士
Your clients have no use for this embryo, Ms. Hoff.

965
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,440
萨勒诺女士唯一能
Ms. Salano's only chance

966
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,030
拥有一个小孩的机会就是得到这个胚胎
of conceiving a child is with that same embryo.

967
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,740
所以胚胎判给她
So it's hers.

968
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,400
谢谢你
Thank you.

969
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,510
我的天  谢谢你
Oh, my God, thank you.

970
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,120
我并不觉得我是一个情绪化的人
I did not think that I was an emotional person,

971
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,220
但看看我
but look at me.

972
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,460
这就是个很牵动情绪的事
It's an emotional thing.

973
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,400
不好意思
Excuse me.

974
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:28,840
如果我能怀孕的话  我只是想让你们知道
If I'm able to get pregnant, I just want you to know

975
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,680
这是你们的功劳
that it will be because of you.

976
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,340
这个小孩也是你们的
This child is just as much yours.

977
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,320
所以  如果你们想要参与我孩子的人生
So, please, if you want to play a role in my child's life,

978
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,070
我愿意尽我所能使其成为现实
I would do anything to make that a reality.

979
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:44,050
这个小孩需要懂得什么是爱
This child needs to know love.

980
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,180
滚蛋吧你
Fuck you.

981
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,400
{\an8}林德尔的女儿花费35万美元狂购珠宝

982
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,510
看啊  他还在发这些文章
Look, he's still sending them out.

983
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,350
看啊
Look, there.

984
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,610
-不  这不是他  -这就是他
- No, it's not him. - Yes, it's him.

985
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,770
这是同一篇文章
I mean, it's the same article.

986
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,960
他说过他会停手的  但他没有
He said he was gonna stop, but he hasn't.

987
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,070
不  他停手了
No, he has.

988
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,900
-这些不是他写的  -你在说什么
- These aren't him. - What are you talking about?

989
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,110
我一直留意红迪网的帖子
I've been going on Reddit.

990
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,640
他们正在接手你前男友的工作
They're picking up what your ex-boyfriend dropped.

991
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:08,240
你和你的家庭在那里不受欢迎
You and your family are not liked there.

992
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,440
天哪
Oh, dear God.

993
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,580
等等  那我该做什么
Wait, so what do I do?

994
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,140
这些文章都发表出来了
I mean, these articles are out there.

995
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,830
讲着恶心的话
They say disgusting things.

996
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,770
这可是红迪网  那就是群乌合之众
It's Rreddit; that's, like, the teeming masses.

997
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,890
-你什么也别做  -什么  我不能起诉吗
- You don't do anything. - What, I can't sue?

998
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,010
-我不能  -你要这么做
- I can't... - Uh, here's what you do:

999
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,360
想知道吗
You want to know?

1000
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,160
随它去吧
You let it go.

1001
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,120
-不  我  -不  我是认真的
- Oh, no, I... - No, seriously.

1002
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,160
你就随它去  不去管它
You have to let it go, ignore it,

1003
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,200
不去想它
push it out of your mind.

1004
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:31,520
认识你的人  都会懂你
The people who know you, know you.

1005
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,080
知道你不会做这些事的
And they know you wouldn't do this.

1006
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,910
你要相信这一点
Come on, you have to trust that.

1007
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,810
我们的指控很清楚了
Our charge is clear.

1008
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,440
跟雷迪克&博斯曼律所的
It's not about police brutality

1009
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,060
暴力执法案件无关
with Reddick & Boseman.

1010
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,410
他们做了什么
What have they done?

1011
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,040
他们的律师做了什么
What have their lawyers done?

1012
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:59,970
就是这里
Here we go.

1013
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,510
这是一篇新闻
Here's a news article

1014
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,820
写的是关于雷迪克&博斯曼的一位律师的事
about one of the Reddick & Boseman lawyers now.

1015
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,590
她花了35万美元
She just spent $350,000

1016
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,770
买珠宝

1017
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,790
这些钱是哪来的
Where did that money come from?

1018
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,580
谁给她的
Who gave it to her?

1019
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,010
现在  各位  我们行动起来
