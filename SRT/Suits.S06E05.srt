{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on "Suits"...

15
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,030
我刚听说你拒绝了一位
I just heard you turned down a client

16
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,370
旗下投资机构价值二十亿美元的客户
whose investment firm is worth $2 billion.

17
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,070
我才不在乎它们价值多少
Well, I don't give a shit how much they're worth.

18
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,050
我是不会为威廉・萨特辩护的
I'm not representing William Sutter.

19
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,620
我没杀人
I didn't kill anyone.

20
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,460
这句话我说了十二年了
I've been saying it for 12 years,

21
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,990
而且我也可以证明
and I can prove it.

22
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,070
你到底要不要给彼此一个机会
Do you want to take a chance on each other or not?

23
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,840
肖恩・卡荷尔刚刚来找了我
I just got a visit from Sean Cahill.

24
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,210
他有办法把你弄出来
It turns out there's a way he can get you out.

25
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,130
条件是什么
What's the catch?

26
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,140
他需要你举报你的狱友
He needs you to inform on your cellmate.

27
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,130
-跟我说实话吧  -他拒绝了
- Tell me the truth. - He said no.

28
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,110
但是肖恩  我跟你说  他会回心转意的
But Sean, I'm telling you, he'll come around.

29
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,660
你知道为了让这件事开始进行
Do you know how many strings I pulled

30
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,770
我找了多少关系吗
to put this thing in motion?

31
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,710
你要履行承诺  把我弄出狱
You're gonna get me out of here like you promised.

32
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,010
-我从没保证过  -六周  哥们
- I never promised-- - Six weeks, brother,

33
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,750
我要是发现你在搞我
and if I find out you're screwing me,

34
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,410
你最好在监狱里的某个黑暗角落打个洞
you better hole up in some dark corner of this prison.

35
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,090
你愿意整修我在汉普顿的
How would you feel about renovating my summer house

36
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,530
-避暑别墅吗  -你确定吗
in the Hamptons? - Are you sure?

37
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,630
我这辈子从来没有这么确定过
I've never been as sure of anything in my entire life.

38
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,570
你一直都想把他带到这儿来
The whole time, you were always gonna bring him here.

39
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,230
因为这是完成任务的办法
Because this is the way to get it done.

40
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,770
那你为什么一开始不告诉我
Then why didn't you tell me that in the first place?

41
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,340
因为那结果会变成你想要利用瑞秋
Because it would've ended up with you wanting to use Rachel.

42
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,800
无论如何结果都是这样了  现在给我让开
It ended there anyway. Now get the hell out of my way.

43
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,320
哈维
Harvey!

44
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,610
我把一切都告诉瑞秋了
I told Rachel everything.

45
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,610
我接受协议
I'm taking the deal.

46
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,420
下面我们来研究一下你具体需要什么
All right, let's talk specifically about what you need.

47
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,160
我需要的是定罪
What I need is a conviction.

48
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,220
那当然  但从我这里来看需要什么
Obviously, but what exactly does that look like from my side?

49
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,120
就是一个铁证
It looks like a smoking gun,

50
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,910
因为我已经追查萨特三年了
'cause I've been after Sutter for three years now.

51
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,340
这个狡猾的混蛋
This guy's one slippery son of a bitch.

52
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,450
等等  威廉・萨特吗
Wait a second. William Sutter?

53
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,330
你在跟我开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

54
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,520
哈维  怎么了
Harvey, what's going on?

55
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,400
他上周来找过我让我为他辩护  但我拒绝了
He came to me a week ago to take him on, and I said no.

56
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,900
这件事你倒是做得很对
Well, it's a good thing you did.

57
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,900
-不  并没有  -你什么意思
- No, it isn't. - What are you talking about?

58
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,950
当凯文发现我拒绝了他的岳父
When Kevin finds out I told his father-in-law

59
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,840
他就再也不会相信迈克了
to drop dead, he's never gonna trust Mike.

60
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,360
如果你这话是我想的那个意思
If you're saying what I think you're saying,

61
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,970
你不能做他的律师
you're not taking this man as your client.

62
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,910
我就要做  因为如果我拒绝
Yes, I am, because if I don't,

63
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,780
也许这件事根本就做不了
we might as well not even be doing this.

64
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,940
-那就别做了  -看看我们现在的境况  肖恩
- Then let's not do it. - Look where we are, Sean.

65
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,560
我们正准备把迈克藏在车里带回监狱
We're in a car, sneaking Mike into prison.

66
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,610
你也动用了所有的关系
You pulled every string you have to make this happen.

67
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,400
你现在说要放弃
You're gonna pull out now?

68
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,750
是的  因为我不会让自己陷入
I am, 'cause I'm not gonna put myself

69
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,180
与你串通的境地
in position to collude with you.

70
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,780
我不会让你陷入那种境地的
I won't put you in that position.

71
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,050
我现在就在这种境地
I'm in that position right now.

72
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,410
你没有
No, you're not.

73
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,070
他现在还没有同意为任何人辩护
He isn't even representing anybody yet.

74
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,060
这次谈话完全是假设性的
This conversation is completely hypothetical.

75
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,110
我不需要罪犯的法律建议
I don't need legal advice from the convict,

76
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,650
我也不想因为你蓄意输掉官司
and I don't need to lose my career

77
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,380
而赔上自己的事业
because you tanked this guy's defense.

78
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,680
我没有蓄意做任何事
I'm not tanking anything.

79
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,950
我会为他竭尽全力
I'm gonna kick ass for him up and down the block,

80
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,120
也没有法律阻止我在此同时
and there's no law against me rooting for Mike

81
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,430
帮助迈克
while I'm doing that.

82
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,100
好吧  但你一旦做了任何威胁到我的事
Okay, but you cross one line that puts me in jeopardy,

83
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,950
我就会把这件事叫停
I'm gonna pull the plug on this whole thing.

84
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,890
那迈克在此之前最好找到
Well, Mike better get us what we need

85
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,690
我们需要的信息
before I have to do that.

86
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,390
你好
Hello?

87
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,150
瑞秋  我是邓巴教授
Rachel. Professor Dunbar.

88
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,750
-有什么事吗  -我知道你对
- What is it? - I know how passionate

89
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,840
伦纳德・贝利的案子充满热情
you were about Leonard Bailey,

90
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,010
但我刚收到无罪计划的反馈
but I just heard back from the Innocence Project,

91
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,160
他的案子不符合要求
and...I'm afraid his case doesn't qualify.

92
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,300
什么叫不符合要求
What do you mean it doesn't qualify?

93
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,340
我们有三个不同的证据用于上诉
We have three different grounds for an appeal.

94
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,410
但不幸的是  没有一种
And, unfortunately, none of them revolve

95
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,280
包含之前未被发现的DNA信息
around the existence of previously undiscovered DNA.

96
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
这有什么关系呢
What does that have to do with it?

97
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,530
他是被冤枉的
The man was railroaded.

98
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,190
他的案子应该被重审
He deserves to have his case retried.

99
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,980
关系非常大
It has everything to do with it,

100
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,090
因为在这样的案件中
because in a case like this,

101
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,320
这是是否符合要求的
that's the primary determinant

102
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,640
首要条件
for whether it qualifies or not.

103
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,410
我不在乎这符不符合要求
I don't care whether it qualifies or not.

104
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,070
我答应过伦纳德・贝利我会为他争取
I promised Leonard Bailey that I'd fight for him.

105
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,410
那你不应该那样做
Well, you shouldn't have done that.

106
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,530
教授  我知道我们不该
Professor, I know that we're not supposed

107
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,440
对我们的客户投入太多感情
to become emotionally invested in our clients,

108
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,770
但如果我们没有任何激情
but if we don't have any passion,

109
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,180
那我们最开始
then what's the point

110
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,830
为什么要帮他呢
of trying to help them in the first place?

111
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,460
瑞秋  我知道这件事听起来很难接受
Rachel, I understand this is a difficult thing to hear,

112
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,230
但我也无能为力
but there's nothing I can do.

113
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,110
我答应你
Look, I give you my word.

114
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,350
会给你找到一个新案子
We'll find you a new case.

115
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,100
-迈克  是你吗  -是我
- Mike, is that you? - Yeah, yeah.

116
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,020
睡觉吧  明早再聊
Go back to sleep. I'll talk to you in the morning.

117
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,460
你怎么样  还好吗
How are you? You all right?

118
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,030
还好
Yeah, I'm fine.

119
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,920
-怎么回事  -不管怎么回事
- What was it? - Whatever it was,

120
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,460
他们都没有查出来
they can't find a trace of it.

121
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,990
正式说法就是食物中毒
Officially, it's food poisoning.

122
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,230
我终于见到你的兄弟哈维了
Well, I finally got the chance to meet your buddy Harvey.

123
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,140
-哈维来了  -就在这里
- Harvey was here? - Mm-hmm, in this very cell.

124
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,150
-你跟我开玩笑吗  -骗你是小狗
- You're kidding me. - I shit you not.

125
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,230
你要是能见到就好了
You should've seen him.

126
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,920
我以为他要打加洛呢
Thought he was gonna attack Gallo right then and there.

127
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,130
-怎么没打  -警卫拦住了
- What stopped him? - Guards.

128
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,930
你确定没事吗
You sure you're okay?

129
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,180
没事
Yeah.

130
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,720
就是需要睡一觉
I just need to get some sleep.

131
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,860
很高兴你能回来  伙计
Well, it's good to have you back, buddy.

132
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,700
一旦你习惯身边有个能信任的人
Once you get used to having someone around you can trust,

133
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,420
就受不了自己独处了
it's hard to go back.

134
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,230
不管你在做什么  我希望你停下
Whatever it is you're doing, I want you to drop it

135
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,800
然后帮我在汉普顿买个别墅
and help me buy a house in the Hamptons.

136
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,360
-你说什么  -我说我需要在汉普顿
- Excuse me? - I said I need a large,

137
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,060
买一栋又大又贵的房子  最好靠近水边
expensive home in the Hamptons, preferably on the water.

138
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,570
路易  我不是有意要做你的商务经理
Louis, I don't mean to be your business manager,

139
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,410
但你为什么要在律所刚刚正要
but why are you buying a vacation home

140
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,850
回到正轨的时候买一栋度假住宅呢
when the firm's just getting back on its feet?

141
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,240
因为我告诉塔拉・梅瑟我在那里有一处房产
Because I told Tara Messer that I have a property out there,

142
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,850
而且我雇了她来重新装修
and I hired her to remodel it for me.

143
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,900
好的  让我先整理一下状况
Okay, let me get this straight.

144
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,550
你想花一大笔钱买一栋住宅
You want to spend a fortune buying a home

145
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,500
这样你就可以再花一大笔钱来重新装修吗
so that you can spend another fortune remodeling it?

146
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,210
这是能让我和她共处的唯一合理的方式
It's the only logical way that I can spend time with her.

147
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,180
-是吗  -是的
- Is it? - Yes.

148
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,510
还能有什么其他办法
What other way could there possibly be?

149
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,790
你可以直接约她出去
You could just ask her out.

150
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,380
-我才不要那么做  -为什么
- Well, I'm not gonna do that. - Why not?

151
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,510
-因为我不要  -路易
- Because I'm not. - Louis.

152
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,330
上帝啊  你为什么想要
Jesus Christ, why are you trying

153
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,570
-破坏我的感情生活  -你没有感情生活
- to sabotage my relationship? - You have no relationship.

154
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,420
这就是我想跟你说的
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

155
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,280
我没有感情生活
I have no relationship.

156
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,580
我孤身一人
I'm all alone.

157
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,930
自从希拉拒绝了我之后
Ever since Sheila rejected me,

158
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,050
我从未想过还能再找到真爱
I never thought I would find love again,

159
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,320
但这种感觉  我不知道
but there is something-- I don't know.

160
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,080
这个女人给我不同寻常的感觉
There's just something about this woman.

161
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,490
我觉得这次可能是我最后的机会了
I feel like this may be my last shot.

162
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,750
我明白  路易  而且如果你约她出去
I get that, Louis, and if you ask her out,

163
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,390
她会见到一位体贴
she is going to see a kind,

164
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,330
睿智的  任何女人
intelligent man that any woman

165
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,700
和他在一起都无比幸运的优秀男士
would be lucky to be in a relationship with.

166
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,640
但如果你这样做的话  当她发现真相之时
But if you do it this way, and she finds out,

167
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,320
你就会失去那最后的机会  
then you lose that shot,

168
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,060
因为她再也不会相信你了
because she's never gonna trust you again.

169
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,290
看着我  唐娜
Look at me, Donna.

170
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,560
那样的一个女人
A woman like that...

171
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,600
拜托
Please.

172
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,490
我得先让她了解我
I need her to get to know me first.

173
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,190
好吧  路易
All right, Louis.

174
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,620
我会帮你找栋房子的
I'll help you find a house.

175
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,480
又在看我的照片吗
Looking at my pictures again?

176
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,040
-抱歉  -怎么了
- Sorry. - What's going on?

177
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,030
没什么  我只是
Nothing. I was just...

178
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,470
我只是在想  当时我问你
I was just thinking about when I asked you

179
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,390
是因为什么事情进来的时候  被人打断了
what you were in for. We got interrupted.

180
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,180
你从未告诉我答案
You never told me.

181
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,390
这样挺好
Oh, well, just as well,

182
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,250
因为我不想谈论这事
'cause I don't want to talk about it.

183
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,930
-好吧  为什么不呢  -为什么
- Okay, why not? - Why not?

184
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,310
因为如果我想说
'Cause if I wanted to talk about it,

185
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,600
我会说的
I'd be talking about it.

186
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,560
我明白我们
Look, I understand that we're not

187
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,040
不应该讨论这些事情的
supposed to talk about that stuff,

188
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,690
但是当你觉得你可能被某人下毒的时候
but when you think you might've been poisoned by somebody,

189
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,530
你就会想多了解一点
it makes you want to know something about the guy

190
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,760
和你共处一室的狱友
you're sharing a cell with.

191
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,810
你是想说你不信任我吗  迈克
You saying you don't trust me, Mike?

192
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,790
凯文  我是认真的
Kevin, I'm serious.

193
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,700
我跟你说了关于我自己的一切
I've told you pretty much everything about me,

194
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,720
而除了你不想让你的孩子来探视这个事实以外
and besides the fact that you don't want your kids to visit,

195
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,360
我对你一无所知
I don't know anything about you.

196
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,270
迈克  有很多事情
Look, Mike, there's a lot of things

197
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,390
我都可以告诉你
that I'm ready to tell you.

198
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,170
我只是还没准备好和你说那件事
I'm just not ready to tell you that.

199
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,100
好吗
Okay?

200
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,680
斯佩克特先生  你没有预约
Mr. Specter, you don't have an appointment.

201
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,010
没事的  朱莉
It's okay, Julie.

202
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,920
有人当着我的面叫我一坨屎
Someone calls me a piece of shit to my face,

203
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,630
我想知道返场小段会是什么
I want to know what the encore is.

204
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,070
你是过来往我地板上撒尿的吗
You here to piss on my floor?

205
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,530
我是过来告诉你  我最终决定接你的案子了
I'm here to tell you that I'm taking your case after all.

206
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,670
你怎么知道我没有在被你拒绝之后
Who says I didn't hire someone else

207
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,070
立马就雇佣了别人呢
the second you turned me down?

208
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,040
因为你不是从通讯录里找到的我
I do, because you didn't pick my name out of a phone book.

209
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,620
你来找我是因为你发现
You came to me because you found out

210
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,630
你的人在监狱里和我的人在一起
that your guy's in prison with my guy.

211
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,520
-如果就是如此呢  -别废话了  威廉
- So what if I did? - Cut the shit, William.

212
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,090
你女婿从我送进监狱的一位犯人手里救了迈克
Your son-in-law saved Mike from a guy I put behind bars.

213
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,530
那意味着我欠了你的情  你之前不跟我说
That means I owe you, and you didn't tell me about it

214
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,090
是因为你知道我会发现的
because you knew I'd find out

215
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,850
然后就会自己爬回来找你
and come crawling back on my own.

216
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,280
你没有爬啊
You're hardly crawling.

217
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,270
我小时候就没爬过
I didn't as a baby,

218
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,760
现在也不会
and I'm not gonna start now.

219
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,150
我只能做到这一步了
This is the best you're gonna get.

220
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,730
到底要不要合作
So are we doing this thing together or not?

221
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,490
好吧  你说服我了  哈维
Okay. You got me, Harvey.

222
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,300
现在怎么办
Now what?

223
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,070
现在我要去见你女婿
Now I go see your son-in-law.

224
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,670
为什么去见他
Why the hell would you want to do that?

225
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,180
因为他在坐牢  而你面临着公诉
Because he's in prison, and you're facing an indictment,

226
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,670
这让他成为了你最大的弱点
which makes him the biggest vulnerability you have.

227
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,560
丹伯里联邦监狱有人向你致电
You have a call from Danbury Federal Prison.

228
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,960
你愿意承担费用吗
Do you accept the charges?

229
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,100
愿意
Yes.

230
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,050
哈维  我们有麻烦了
Harvey, we have a problem.

231
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,720
-什么麻烦  -我试图和凯文谈谈
- What is it? - I tried to talk to Kevin.

232
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,660
什么也没问出来
I got nothing.

233
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,410
你想让我怎么做
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

234
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,320
我不知道  如果我有除了
I don't know. It would help

235
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,720
"你到底因为什么事进来的"
if I had something to talk about other than,

236
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,030
以外的话可以说  那应该会有所帮助
"Hey, what exactly are you in here for?"

237
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,290
好吧  迈克  你想要点话题吗
Okay, Mike, you want something to talk about?

238
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,410
我来给你找点话题
I'll get you something to talk about.

239
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,940
这不是我的白马公主嘛
Well, if it isn't my knight in beautiful armor.

240
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,170
你好吗  贝利先生
How are you, Mr. Bailey?

241
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,120
请叫我伦纳德
Please, call me Leonard.

242
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,520
恐怕有坏消息  伦纳德
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Leonard.

243
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,320
无罪计划审阅了那些新的证据  然后
The Innocence Project looked over the new evidence, and...

244
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,850
他们决定不接你这个案子
they decided not to take your case.

245
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,250
什么意思
What does that mean?

246
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,730
意思就是我无能为力了
It means there's nothing else I can do.

247
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,760
我就知道你根本帮不上我
I knew you couldn't do shit for me.

248
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,230
不  不  不  你不明白
No, no, no. You don't understand.

249
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,490
他们几乎从不接没有新DNA证据的案子的
They almost never take cases without new DNA evidence,

250
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,920
而你的案子没有这种证据
and yours had none.

251
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,530
我不在乎这一点
I don't care about that.

252
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,150
你请求我给你个机会冒险一试
You asked me to take a chance on you,

253
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,740
而现在你却过来告诉我你要放弃吗
and now you march in here and tell me you're giving up?

254
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,860
不  不  贝利先生
No, no, Mr. Bailey--

255
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,150
你说你会为我而战的
You said you would fight for me.

256
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,940
我确实努力过了
I did fight for you.

257
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,290
那就他妈的再努力一点
Well, then fight goddamn harder!

258
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,990
我很抱歉
I'm sorry,

259
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,190
我明白你的感受
and I understand how you feel,

260
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,410
但我真的无能为力了
but there's just nothing more that I can do.

261
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,100
你怎么能知道我的感受
How do you know what I feel?

262
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,000
你不知道与你爱的人
You don't know what it's like to be kept away

263
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,460
不能见面是什么滋味
from your loved ones.

264
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,460
-其实  我知道  -怎么回事
- Actually, I do. - How's that?

265
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,220
我的未婚夫也在监狱里
My fiancé's in prison.

266
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,870
刑期多久
How long?

267
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,590
-两年  -两年根本不算什么
- Two years. - Two years is nothing.

268
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,130
可这对我的影响却很大
It doesn't feel like nothing to me.

269
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,110
如果是终身监禁呢  瑞秋
What if it was forever, Rachel?

270
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,730
你会像放弃我一样放弃他吗
Would you give up on him like you did me?

271
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,230
我没有放弃你
I didn't give up on you.

272
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,220
你之前说你已经找到了有力证据
You said you found compelling evidence.

273
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,370
我也说过那点证据根本不够充分
I also said that it wasn't enough.

274
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,450
这话在我听来  就是放弃
That sounds like giving up to me.

275
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,980
哈维  你怎么来了
Harvey, what are you doing here?

276
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,390
我是来给你下正式通知的
I'm here to give you official notice.

277
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,020
现在我已经是威廉・萨特的律师了
I'm now William Sutter's attorney.

278
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,170
恭喜  希望你清楚自己该做些什么
Congratulations. I hope you know what you're doing.

279
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,680
我清楚  因为我此行就是来告诉你
I do, because I'm also here to notify you that

280
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,310
除非你在接下来的四十八小时内提起公诉
unless you bring an indictment in the next 48 hours,

281
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,030
我会起诉你和证监会对我客户造成了骚扰
I'm gonna sue you and the SEC for harassing my client.

282
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,110
你这话什么意思
What the hell are you talking about?

283
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,210
你听到了  你一直在
You heard me. You've been digging

284
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,500
调查他的账户  刺探他的员工
into his accounts, hounding his employees,

285
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,970
并且还审问他的出资人
and questioning his investors.

286
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,910
他因内线交易正在接受调查
He's under investigation for insider trading.

287
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,800
那些都是例行公事
That's how it works.

288
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,730
那样的话  提起公诉吧
Well, if that's how it works, then bring on an indictment.

289
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,410
我明白你的意图了
Ah, I see what you're doing.

290
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,650
我不采取点行动  迈克就撬不开凯文的嘴
Mike can't get Kevin to talk without me bringing an action.

291
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,410
我不知道你这话什么意思
I have no idea what you're talking about.

292
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,360
那也没关系
Oh, well, it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm not

293
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
因为在没有胜诉把握的情况下
bringing an indictment without knowing

294
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,360
我是不会提起公诉的
that I can win at trial.

295
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,500
可如果你连投石问路都不敢
And you're never gonna win at trial

296
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,040
就永远不会胜诉的
if you don't shake the trees and see what falls.

297
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,920
可恶  哈维  我不会在这个案子上和你串通
Damn it, Harvey, I am not colluding on this,

298
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,190
你居然来这里
and you're in here trying to get me

299
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,090
怂恿我对你自己的客户提起公诉
to bring an indictment against your own client.

300
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,190
因为你提起公诉后
Because when you bring that indictment,

301
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,010
我会打赢官司  可你不起诉
I'm gonna beat it, and if you don't bring it

302
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,710
且继续调查我的客户
and continue investigating my client,

303
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,720
我就会去告你  
I'm gonna sue you, which is exactly

304
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,620
不管我的客户是谁  我都会那么做
what I'd be doing no matter who he was.

305
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,750
哈维  你想让我有所行动
You know what, Harvey? You want me to bring an action?

306
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,880
我就给你个行动
You got one.

307
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,010
天啊  原来你在这
Jesus Christ, there you are.

308
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,940
房子找得怎么样了
What's going on with the house hunt?

309
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,320
一切都在我的掌控中  路易
I am on top of it, Louis.

310
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,410
可我没看出来
Well, it doesn't look like you're on top of it.

311
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,200
我只看到你在这喝咖啡
It looks like you're drinking a goddamn cup of coffee.

312
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,190
我喝咖啡也许是因为昨晚通宵上网
Maybe that's because I was on the Internet all night

313
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,670
替你找房子  因为我很清楚
trying to find houses for you because I knew

314
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,240
你要求那么苛刻  肯定什么都看不上
that nothing would ever meet your insane specifications.

315
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,060
-是真的吗  -当然不是
- Is that true? - Not one word.

316
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,840
该死  唐娜  这很重要
Goddamn it, Donna, this is important.

317
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,070
眼下满大街都是
Right now there are hundreds of men out there

318
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,670
有海滨别墅的男人
with beach houses,

319
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,940
塔拉没准现在就在跟其中某个人约会呢
and Tara could be meeting any one of them.

320
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,030
多希望我此刻也在约会那种富豪
Right now I wish I was meeting any one of them.

321
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,610
唐娜  我以为你明白这不是玩笑
Donna, I thought you understood this isn't a joke.

322
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,780
我知道不是玩笑  路易
I know it isn't, Louis,

323
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,290
所以到现在我还没把找到的资料给你看
and that's why I haven't sent you anything I've seen so far,

324
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,780
因为我还没找到最合适的房子
because I haven't found the right thing yet.

325
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,540
我怎么感觉我不再相信你能够
And what if I said I lost confidence in your ability

326
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,560
时时刻刻都理解我的意图了呢
to know what I'm looking for in any given situation?

327
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,780
那我只好告诉你
Then I would say that that is exactly

328
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,880
这正是我一直都在躲着你的原因
why I've been avoiding you,

329
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,320
如果你还有点自知之明的话
and if you had any self-awareness at all,

330
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,140
就不会再来烦我  而是该信任我
you would stop bothering me and instead trust me for once.

331
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,530
你我都清楚这是永远不可能的
Well, we both know that's never gonna happen.

332
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,160
那你就自己去找房子吧  路易
Well, then, why don't you go find your own house, Louis?

333
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,520
-金[纸牌游戏]  -又赢了
- Gin. - Again?

334
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,180
跟你说了多少次了
How many times do I have to tell you?

335
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,520
不要跟过目不忘的人玩牌
Don't play cards with a guy with a photographic memory.

336
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,480
我也说过很多次  我肯定会赢你的
How many times I have to tell you I'm still gonna beat you?

337
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,660
发牌吧
Deal.

338
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,910
抱歉打扰你们钓鱼了
Sorry to interrupt your Go Fish.

339
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,980
有个叫哈维・斯佩克特要见你
There's a Harvey Specter here to see you.

340
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,530
算你运气好
Saved by the bell.

341
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,900
不是见你  罗斯  米勒
Not you, Ross. Miller.

342
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,980
能否告诉我为什么你要见我而不是迈克
Mind if I ask why you're here to see me instead of Mike?

343
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,190
因为我知道他还好
Because I heard he's okay,

344
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,380
并且我也不止是迈克的律师了
and I'm not just Mike's attorney anymore.

345
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,170
也是你的律师
I'm yours.

346
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,140
加洛的事不用你替我操心
I don't need your help with Gallo.

347
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,560
我说的不是加洛
I'm not talking about Gallo.

348
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,420
威廉・萨特找我来当他的代理人
William Sutter came to me to represent him.

349
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,790
我当时拒绝了他  后来却发现他的女婿
I turned him down until I found out that his son-in-law

350
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,770
一直在监狱里关照迈克
is the one who's been watching Mike's back.

351
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,300
谢谢你能这么说
Well, I appreciate that,

352
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,110
但这跟我又有什么关系
but what does that have to do with me?

353
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,680
我一般不会给我不信任的人当代理人
I don't make it a habit of representing people I can't trust.

354
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,730
你的意思是你不信任我
You saying you can't trust me?

355
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,310
我的意思是证监会认为威廉的公司
I'm saying the SEC thinks William's firm,

356
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,740
也就是你曾供职的公司
the one that you worked for,

357
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,970
犯了法
is breaking the law.

358
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,750
所以我想知道
So I need to know right now,

359
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,280
如果他们来找你  你会怎么说
when they come at you, what are you gonna say?

360
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,890
我会把上次对他们说的话
I'm gonna say the same thing I did

361
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,630
一字不差地再说一次
when they came at me the last time.

362
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,660
我岳父是清白的
My father-in-law's innocent.

363
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,720
这可以吗  我能走了吗
Is that it or can I go?

364
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,080
还有件事  凯文
One more thing, Kevin.

365
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,680
公诉方随时都会提起公诉
An indictment's coming down any second,

366
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,760
一旦那样
and once it does,

367
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,910
你就会成为所有狱友的出狱卡
that makes you every single inmate's ticket out of here.

368
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,380
因此  假如你对威廉的清白心存疑虑
So if you ever have a doubt about William's innocence,

369
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,580
就把它烂在肚子里
keep it to your goddamn self.

370
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,560
凯文  聊两句
Kevin, talk to you for a second?

371
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,770
怎么了  乔治
Yeah, sure. What's going on, George?

372
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,180
-是你室友的事  -他怎么了
- It's about your roommate. - What about him?

373
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,230
你还有心思在这玩牌
You got some nerve playing cards here

374
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,130
我的生命正在一分一秒地消逝
while my life is wasting away.

375
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,150
你想说什么
What are you talking about?

376
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
我的意思是
I'm talking about that motion

377
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,700
你不是说好了帮我递交动议吗
you were supposed to file for me.

378
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,950
你还是打听明白再来找我吧
Then you better get your facts straight,

379
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,790
我已经递交了
because I did file it.

380
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,830
没错  可被驳了回来
Yeah, and it got bounced right back.

381
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,000
-什么  不可能  -什么不可能
- What? No, that's not possible. - It is possible.

382
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,170
你在医务室美美地睡着
While you were taking your little siesta in the infirmary,

383
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,930
我却收到邮件说
I got an email that said

384
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,690
这玩意递交得都不对
the damn thing wasn't even filed right.

385
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,680
该死
Oh, goddamn it.

386
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,080
看来你没法信守承诺了
Looks like you can't keep your promises.

387
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,140
不  我能
No, I can keep it.

388
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,350
只是程序上出了问题
This is just some procedural mix-up, all right?

389
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,390
但我需要你的电话
But I'm gonna need to use your phone.

390
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,230
你逗我呢吧
Are you kidding me?

391
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,040
我说  我能解决这件事
I'm telling you that I can have this thing taken care of.

392
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,050
只是需要打个电话
I just need to make a phone call.

393
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,890
监狱里的电话有问题吗
What's wrong with the goddamn phones in here?

394
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,190
没有  但我今天已经用过了
Nothing, but I already used it today,

395
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,940
也就是说我得等两天后才能再用
which means I can't use it for another two days.

396
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,900
所以除非你想浪费这两天时间陪我打扑克
So unless you want to waste that time playing cards with me,

397
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,280
而且我保证你赢不了
which I guarantee you'll lose,

398
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,960
就赶紧把你的手机给我
you'll give me your phone right now.

399
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,310
我喜欢你  你很有种
I like you. You got balls.

400
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,580
我告诉你  我也一样
You know what? So do I,

401
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,060
所以我才能当着狱警的面
which is why I can take this out

402
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,010
拿出这玩意儿晃
in front of any guard in here

403
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,820
还知道我不会有麻烦
and know I'm not getting in any trouble.

404
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,420
给我记住了  赶紧把这事解决了
Don't forget that, and get that shit handled.

405
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,990
哈维  有东西给你
Harvey, I have something for you.

406
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,190
-什么东西  -来自肖恩・卡荷尔
- What is it? - It's from Sean Cahill,

407
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,830
需要你马上看
and I need you to take a look at it right away.

408
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,650
看什么啊  我知道诉状什么样
Why? I know what an indictment looks like.

409
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,920
不是诉状  哈维
It's not an indictment, Harvey.

410
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,340
他要吊销威廉・萨特的交易执照
He's suspending William Sutter's trading license.

411
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,630
给卡荷尔打电话
Get Cahill on the phone.

412
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,150
先生  哈维・斯佩克特的电话
Sir, I have Harvey Specter on the line.

413
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,080
你逗我呢吧
You've got to be shitting me.

414
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,150
哈维  有什么事吗
Harvey, what can I do for you?

415
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,050
你可以给我解释一下你要暂停我的
You can explain to me what the hell you're up to,

416
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,230
委托人的交易执照是想干什么
suspending my client's trading license.

417
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,500
你想让事情往下发展
You wanted to get the ball rolling.

418
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,950
这就是后续剧情
This gets the ball rolling.

419
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,100
这不是我想要的
This isn't what I wanted.

420
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,860
你也不是我老板
And I don't take orders from you.

421
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,820
上了庭我也没法阻止此事
And I'm not gonna be able to stop this in court,

422
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,720
那萨特肯定要解雇我
which means Sutter's gonna fire me.

423
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,980
那也许是你没理解我一开始的打算
Then maybe you didn't understand my initial position.

424
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,960
我才不在乎你会不会被解雇
I don't give a shit if you get fired or not.

425
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,870
你认为你需要代理萨特
You thought that you needed to represent Sutter,

426
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,990
所以你就做了你认为你该做的事
so you went ahead and did what you needed to do.

427
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,660
我认为我在有足够证据前
I thought I didn't want to bring an indictment

428
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,560
不想提起诉讼
before I had enough to win,

429
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,690
所以我就做了我认为该做的事
so I did what I needed to do,

430
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,250
但我现在该做的
but what I need to do right now

431
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,370
是吃完这个美味的火腿三明治
is finish this delicious ham sandwich,

432
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,710
意思就是说我希望下次我们谈话
which means the next time that I talk to you,

433
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,810
会是在法庭上
I expect it to be in court.

434
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,380
怎么回事
What's going on?

435
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,700
什么怎么回事
What do you mean, what's going on?

436
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,580
我们本来在玩牌
I mean, we're playing cards,

437
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,870
哈维来见你
and Harvey's here to see you,

438
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,780
接着我就发现你
and then next thing I know,

439
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,290
远远的对我死亡凝视
you're giving me some death stare,

440
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,370
然后就跑这儿来了
and you come out here.

441
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,420
什么事都没有
Nothing's going on.

442
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,840
哈维找你干什么
Well, what did Harvey want?

443
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,350
他要代理我岳父
He's representing my father-in-law,

444
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,900
所以他现在也是我的律师了
which means now he's also representing me.

445
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,010
满意了吗
That good enough for you?

446
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,850
好吧  凯文  你怎么这个态度
All right, Kevin, what's with the attitude?

447
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,280
-我是你这边的  -你是吗
- I'm on your side. - Are you?

448
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,470
因为哈维说我不该信任任何人
'Cause Harvey said I shouldn't trust anyone in here,

449
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,960
我认为  这应该包括你
and as far as I'm concerned, that includes you.

450
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,120
什么  这毫无道理
What? that doesn't make any sense.

451
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,780
你知道什么最没道理吗
You know what doesn't make any sense?

452
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,690
一分钟前  加洛还是你的敌人
One minute Gallo is your enemy,

453
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,460
一分钟后
and the next minute,

454
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,420
他就像你的好朋友一样把手机给你了
he's handing you his cell phone like he's your best friend.

455
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,970
我是在想办法把他弄出去
I'm trying to help him get out of here,

456
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,100
这样对我们都好
which is good for both of us.

457
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,500
你昨晚离开监狱也是去做这件事吗
Is that what you were doing last night outside of prison?

458
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,170
帮他出狱
You were helping him get out?

459
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,620
是这样吗
Is that what was going on?

460
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,150
凯文  好了
Kevin, come on.

461
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,670
我昨天还很担心你呢  室友
I was worried about you, cellmate.

462
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,140
我以为真的很严重
I thought you were in real trouble,

463
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,010
但他们不让我见你
but they wouldn't let me see you,

464
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,480
所以我托了一个
so I asked a friend of mine

465
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,080
在医务室工作的朋友去看你
who works in the infirmary to check on you,

466
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,580
十分钟前他告诉我  他十分确定
and ten minutes ago he told me that he's pretty damn sure

467
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,680
你至少离开了三个小时
you were gone for at least three hours.

468
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,310
你怎么解释
Well, what do you have to say about that?

469
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,290
我不在是因为去了医院
I was gone because I was in the hospital.

470
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,210
你怎么没告诉我
That's the first I'm hearing about it.

471
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,080
我告诉你干什么
Yeah, and why would I tell you that?

472
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,060
为什么不该告诉我
Why wouldn't you?

473
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,550
有什么事不对劲  我能看出来
Something's going on here, and I can tell.

474
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,940
好吧  凯文  你想知道真相
All right, Kevin. You want to know what happened?

475
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,970
真相就是哈维给了医生钱送我去医院
I went to the hospital because harvey paid the doctor

476
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,750
因为他不相信
because he didn't trust that

477
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,160
我能在监狱医务室活过昨晚
I would make it through the night in here,

478
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,780
而我没告诉你
and I didn't tell you

479
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,100
是因为我不想让你
because I didn't want to put you in a position

480
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,160
-替我说谎  -我告诉你
- where you'd have to lie for me. - You know what?

481
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,530
你这话听起来就是胡扯
That sounds like a whole lot of bullshit to me.

482
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,070
我告诉你  凯文
Yeah, you know what, Kevin?

483
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,000
我觉得最可笑的是你口口声声说你不信任我
I think it's pretty goddamn funny that you don't trust me

484
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,250
但你才是那个连进来的原因
when you're the one that won't even tell me

485
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,500
都不敢告诉我的人
what you're in here for.

486
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,590
不好  不好  不好
No. No. No.

487
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,140
该死  不好
Shit, no.

488
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,760
不好  不好  不好
No. No. No.

489
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,470
忙着呢  哈维
Not now, Harvey.

490
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,050
我正在处理重要的事
I'm in the middle of something important.

491
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,290
不管是什么  都没这个重要
Whatever it is, it's not as important as this.

492
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,580
这是什么
What is this?

493
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,930
暂停威廉・萨特交易执照的通知书
It's notice to suspend William Sutter's trading license.

494
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,460
问题是  怎么解决
The question is, what can be done about it?

495
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,470
没法解决
Nothing can be done about it.

496
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,790
什么叫没法解决
What do you mean, nothing can be done about it?

497
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,350
你不是财务大师吗
You're supposed to be the financial wizard.

498
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,290
我的确是  而且我明确告诉你
I am, and I'm telling you

499
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,820
这种东西是证交所出的
that this kind of thing is at the SEC's discretion.

500
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,560
他们有权力
They have unlimited power

501
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,550
暂停任意交易执照九十天
to suspend trading licenses up to 90 days.

502
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,930
-该死  -只有九十天
- Goddamn it. - It's only 90 days.

503
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,400
九十天我就被解雇了
90 days gets me fired.

504
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,430
没事的  哈维
Well, it's gonna be okay, Harvey.

505
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,820
我知道最近公司状况不太好
I mean, I know things have been rough around here,

506
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,670
但是已经有起色了
but business is picking up.

507
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,190
不是为了生意  路易
This isn't about business, Louis.

508
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,360
是为了迈克
It's about Mike.

509
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,680
你瞒着我什么  哈维
What are you not telling me, Harvey?

510
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,880
我不会告诉你细节
I'm not gonna tell you the details,

511
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,690
是因为不想让你也担风险
because I'm not gonna put you at risk,

512
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,710
但我有个机会让迈克早点出来
but I have a chance to get Mike out early,

513
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,730
要是没了这个动议  这事儿就黄了
and if I lose this motion, it's over.

514
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,310
我会想办法解决这件事的
Well, then I'll figure out a way to get it done.

515
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,340
谢谢你  路易
Thank you, Louis.

516
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,910
-我是哈维・斯佩克特  -哈维  是我
- This is Harvey Specter. - Harvey, it's me.

517
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,050
迈克  你哪里来的私人电话
Mike, what the hell are you doing with a private phone?

518
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,800
你代理凯文又是怎么回事
What the hell are you doing representing Kevin?

519
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
是你没办法让他说实话
You were the one having trouble getting him to open up.

520
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,580
然后你觉得告诉他不要相信这里的任何人
And you thought telling him not to trust anyone in here

521
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,820
就是解决办法吗
was the answer to that?

522
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,750
听着  我这么做是为了让他相信我
Look, I did that to get him to trust me,

523
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,230
因为他相信了我  就会相信你
because if he trusts me, he trusts you.

524
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,920
好吧  但有件事你没料到
Yeah, well, you didn't count on one thing.

525
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,320
他知道我昨晚晚没在医疗室
He knows I wasn't in the infirmary the whole night.

526
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,480
什么  他怎么知道的
What? How the hell does he know that?

527
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,990
他有个熟人在那里工作
Some guy he knows works there.

528
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,950
我骗他说你带我去了医院
I told him some story about you taking me to the hospital,

529
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,920
但他不相信
but he's not buying it.

530
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,380
那你就要想个办法让他相信
Then you figure out a way to make him buy it.

531
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,650
好  我会想办法的
Fine, I'll think of something,

532
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,900
但这不是我唯一的问题
but that's not my only problem.

533
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,990
又怎么了
What now?

534
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,880
加洛的动议被退回来了
Gallo's filing came back.

535
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,200
这个动议需要
It needs to be filed in person

536
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,630
由其辩护律师本人提出
and it needs to be filed by his attorney of record.

537
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,300
你逗我呢吧
You got to be shitting me.

538
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,380
你要我代理那个野兽
You want me to represent that animal?

539
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,820
如果你不这样做  那让凯文说实话
If you don't, then getting Kevin to talk

540
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,550
就只能算是个小问题了
is gonna be the least of my problems.

541
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,830
瑞秋  我需要你帮忙
Rachel, I need your help with something.

542
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,360
什么事
What can I do?

543
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,290
我要你给弗兰克・加洛起草一份保释申请文件
I need you to draft a parole application for Frank Gallo.

544
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,550
迈克不是正在办吗
I thought Mike was doing that.

545
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,510
出现了问题
There was a problem,

546
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,990
所以我还需要你起草一份任命书
which is also why i need you to draw up an engagement letter

547
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,890
让我代理弗兰克・加洛
for me to be Gallo's attorney.

548
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,590
行
Done.

549
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,770
你怎么了
What is it?

550
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,600
你听到了你之前跟路易发脾气
I heard you get upset with Louis earlier,

551
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,210
然后你又因为加洛的事情来找我
and now you're coming to me about Gallo.

552
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,050
所以我只是想知道你是否
So...I just need to know if you think

553
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,250
真的认为卡荷尔这整件事行得通
this whole Cahill thing's really gonna work.

554
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:39,760
瑞秋...
Rachel--

555
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,740
哈维  告诉我真相吧
Harvey, just tell me the truth.

556
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,010
听着  我不知道行不行得通
Look, I don't know if it's gonna work or not,

557
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,820
但是我知道我不会放弃
but I do know I'm not gonna stop trying.

558
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,970
不得不说  作为一个刚在院子
Got to say, you don't look so bad for a guy

559
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,990
晕倒的过人  你的气色还不错
who blacked out in the yard the other day.

560
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,850
是啊  他们照顾得好
Yeah, they took good care of me.

561
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,200
我很高兴你没事
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

562
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,730
有什么事
What's on your mind?

563
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,740
我要你为我给典狱长捎个口信
I need you to get a message to the warden for me.

564
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,730
当然可以
Sure.

565
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,100
我们例行每周早午餐的时候就告诉他
I'll bring it to him at our weekly brunch.

566
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,530
你要我传什么口信
What would you like for it to say?

567
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,520
-我认真的  -我才不管你怎样
- I'm serious. - I don't care what you are.

568
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,830
你想要给典狱长捎口信
You want to get a message to the warden,

569
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,890
你就要通过正当途径
you go through the proper channels

570
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,760
自己跟他说
and get it to him yourself.

571
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,020
我不能走正当程序
I can't go through the proper channels,

572
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,800
因为这事儿得保密
because nobody can know about it.

573
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,530
好吧  迈克  告诉我是什么情况
All right, Mike, tell me what's going on.

574
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,690
为了早出狱我做了交易
I made a deal to get out of here early.

575
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,810
什么样的交易
What kind of deal?

576
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,770
告发某个人之类的
The kind where I inform on someone.

577
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,750
谁
Someone?

578
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,290
凯文・米勒
Kevin Miller.

579
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,710
-迈克  不是吧  -朱利叶斯  容我解释
- Mike, come on. - Julius, let me explain.

580
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,170
我不需要你解释
I don't need you to explain.

581
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,550
你要背叛你的室友  之前还要我保护的那个
You are betraying your cellmate, who you came to me to protect.

582
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,700
不  我是要让那个罪行比我
No, what I am doing is putting away someone

583
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,720
更恶劣却仍逍遥法外的人进监狱
who is out there doing worse things than I ever did.

584
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,910
所以我不需要你的评判  我需要你的帮助
So I don't need your judgment. I need your help.

585
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,710
抱歉  我的工作不是为你做这些
I'm sorry, it's not my job to help you do something like this.

586
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,590
不  你的工作帮我做好出狱生活的准备
No, it's your job to help me prepare for life after prison.

587
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,400
而这个能让出狱生活
Well, this is gonna make life after prison

588
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,840
更快实现
come a hell of a lot faster.

589
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,960
好  你想这么做吗
Well, fine, you want to do this?

590
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,340
那你就去做吧  但我不会帮你的
You go ahead and do it, but I am not gonna be complicit.

591
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,580
你一直说让我相信你  冠冕堂皇
You know what? You talk a big goddamn game about trusting you,

592
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,870
但相信你到底意味着什么
but what does that trust mean?

593
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,450
现在  我要给典狱长捎个信
Now, I need to get to the warden,

594
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,320
我要在守卫不发现的情况下捎给他
and I need to do it without the guards finding out.

595
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,820
你到底帮不帮我
Can you help me or not?

596
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,030
瑞秋  这么晚你怎么来了
Rachel, what are you doing here so late?

597
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,310
教授  您有时间吗
Professor, do you have a minute?

598
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,700
当然  坐吧
Of course. Yeah, sit down.

599
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,740
我今早去看了伦纳德・贝利
I went to see Leonard Bailey this morning

600
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,370
告诉他我们放弃了他
to tell him we were turning our backs on him.

601
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,110
没有人放弃他  瑞秋
No one's turning their back on him, Rachel.

602
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,020
只是我们有了更好的案子
There are just better cases.

603
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,030
无意冒犯  但这是屁话
No offense, but that's bullshit.

604
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,300
-什么  -你也看了他的文件
- Excuse me? - You read his file.

605
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,770
里面有足够的证据能够让他重新受审
There's enough evidence in there for him to get a new trial,

606
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,560
可我们却要让他烂在死囚监狱里
and instead we're gonna let him rot on death row.

607
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,000
瑞秋  我知道你的感受
Rachel, I understand how you feel,

608
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,390
-但有些事情...  -我想我是
- but there are some things that-- - I feel like

609
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,800
弃了您的课才接手的这个案子
I dropped your class to take this case.

610
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,460
我也告诉你我可以再给你一个案子
And I told you I'd get you another one.

611
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,030
我不想要其他的案子  我就想要这个
I don't want another one. I want this one.

612
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,010
瑞秋  我不能再
Rachel, I cannot provide you

613
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,480
提供资源来支持你了
with the resources and the backing anymore.

614
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,000
好  要是如果我自己能找到资源
Okay, so what if I were able to provide my own resources

615
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,220
并找到一位合格律师来监督我呢
and--and to get the supervision of a qualified lawyer?

616
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,110
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

617
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,020
我在皮-斯-利律所工作  教授
I work at Pearson Specter Litt, Professor.

618
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,200
大家都知道他们会时不时地
They've been known to take a pro bono case

619
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,490
接手一些公益案
from time to time.

620
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,970
好
Okay.

621
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,640
好  你赢了  瑞秋  但这是很不合规矩的
Okay, you win, Rachel, but this is highly irregular.

622
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,910
我不在乎
I don't care.

623
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,010
这也不是我们
That's not a good enough reason

624
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,820
放弃伦纳德・贝利的充分理由
to turn our backs on Leonard Bailey.

625
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,090
不要再质疑我高超的财务能力了
Well, don't ever question my financial wizardry again.

626
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,010
说说看
Let's have it.

627
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,980
我想破了脑袋
I was banging my head against the wall,

628
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,880
想要找到一个阻止吊销的办法
trying to figure out a way to stop the suspension,

629
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,580
然后我灵机一动
but then it dawned on me.

630
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,930
我们根本不需要阻止这件事
We don't need to stop it.

631
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,770
如果我们能让萨特的公司成为
If we can turn Sutter's firm into the subsidiary

632
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,370
一个独立控股公司的子公司
of a separate holding company,

633
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,390
我们就能让其他人来帮他运营
we can find someone else to execute the trades for him.

634
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,760
-漂亮  -是啊  但唯一的问题是
- Beautiful. - Yeah, but the only issue is,

635
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,070
我们需要找到些愿意
we need to find traders that are willing

636
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,510
资助那个混蛋的交易员
to bankroll the son of a bitch,

637
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,450
鉴于他的名声
given his reputation.

638
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,510
这不是什么问题
Well, that's not gonna be a problem.

639
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,940
不  哈维  这不是个小问题
No, Harvey, this is not nothing.

640
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,460
没人愿意和那家伙共事
Nobody wants to work with this guy.

641
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,520
你忘记在我们对面的朋友了
You're forgetting our new friends across the hall.

642
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,160
什  什么  你在逗我吗
What? What, are you kidding me?

643
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,010
你认为那个混蛋会答应我的要求吗
You think that asshole's gonna say yes to me?

644
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,580
没关系  我知道他会答应谁的要求
It's okay. I know who he'll say yes to.

645
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,840
哈维
Harvey,

646
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,750
我知道迈克走后你心里不好受
I know how tough it's been not having Mike here,

647
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,390
我只是想让你知道我也很想念他
and I just want to let you know that I miss him too.

648
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,220
我很感谢  路易  但你没有必要说这些
I appreciate that, Louis, but you didn't have to say it,

649
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,850
因为行动胜于言语
because actions speak louder than words,

650
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,480
你所做的这些已经说明了一切
and you doing this says it all.

651
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,370
哈维  我找了你一天了
Harvey, I've been looking for you all day.

652
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,660
你找到我了
Well, here I am.

653
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,760
或许你可以告诉我为什么
Then maybe you can tell me why all of a sudden

654
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,330
我们突然又代理威廉・萨特了
we're representing William Sutter.

655
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,430
-我改变主意了  -你改变主意了
- I changed my mind. - You changed your mind?

656
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:36,490
是你告诉我为萨特辩护就如同出卖灵魂
You told me taking Sutter on would be like selling your soul,

657
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,150
但是现在你突然180度大转弯
and now you're doing a complete 180.

658
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:38,980
杰西卡  我
Jessica, I--

659
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,780
不  哈维
No, Harvey,

660
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,000
我不是说我不高兴
I'm not saying I don't like it.

661
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,460
我只是想知道到底是为什么
I just want to know what's going on.

662
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,340
萨特是卡荷尔的目标
Sutter's the one Cahill's after.

663
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,610
你逗我呢吧
You've got to be kidding me.

664
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,040
绝对没有
I shit you not.

665
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,600
好吧  我懂了
well, I get it.

666
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,470
你为他全力辩护
You give him a full-throttle defense,

667
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,720
取得他的信任
gain his trust,

668
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,910
然后向上帝祈祷迈克能釜底抽薪
and hope to God Mike cuts his legs out.

669
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,010
正是这样
Exactly.

670
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,710
怎么了
What?

671
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,730
他会把他的投资业务交给我们打理吗
Is he gonna give us his investment business?

672
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,100
除非我们赢了这场官司
Not until after we win.

673
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,460
但我们又不能赢
Which we're hoping we don't.

674
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,320
-杰西卡  我必须要这样做  -哈维  别紧张
- Jessica, I have to do this. - Harvey, relax.

675
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,080
我同意  代理他能减少经济负担
I'm on board. It pays the bills,

676
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,310
我们还能利用它来找到更多的业务
and we can leverage it into more business anyway,

677
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,450
但我们最好尽快利用
but we'd better leverage it fast,

678
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,310
因为输掉这场官司对迈克也许是好事
because losing this case might be good for Mike,

679
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,990
但对我们来说不是
but it's not gonna be good for us,

680
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,850
我不知道你怎么想的
and I don't know about you,

681
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,320
但我想再次回到顶峰
but I'd like to get back on top.

682
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,010
这正是我所想的
There's nothing I'd like more,

683
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,910
也是我来这里的原因
which is why I came in here.

684
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,290
你需要什么
What do you need?

685
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,470
我需要你让那些交易员帮个忙
I need you to get something from those traders.

686
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,510
站起来  罗斯  你被单独监禁了
On your feet, Ross. You're going to solitary.

687
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,010
什么  等等  你什么意思
What? Wait, what are you talking about?

688
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,870
你听到我说的了  单独监禁24小时  走吧
You heard me. 24 hours, let's go.

689
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,060
不  我哪也不跟你去
No, I'm not going anywhere with you

690
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,020
除非你告诉我到底发生了什么
until you tell me what's going on.

691
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,070
我让你去哪你就去哪
You'll go where I tell you to,

692
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,620
否则你就等着尝尝这个的滋味
or you'll get acquainted with this.

693
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,490
听着  我只想知道为什么
Listen to me. I just want to know why--

694
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,790
再问问题  监禁时间就翻倍
Next question makes it 48 hours.

695
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,390
走不走
You coming or not?

696
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,690
你做了什么
What did you do?

697
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,370
杰西卡  太好了  我找到你了
Jessica--good, I caught you.

698
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,950
瑞秋  怎么了
Rachel, what is it?

699
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,080
你还记得无罪计划的案子吗
Do you remember my Innocence Project case?

700
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,040
我怎么能不记得呢  厉害的瑞秋
How could I not? Badass Rachel.

701
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,890
谢谢你  我接了那个案子
Well, thank you. So I took it,

702
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,120
但现在他们说那个案子不符合无罪计划
but now they're saying that it doesn't qualify.

703
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,010
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

704
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,710
你想让我们作为公益诉讼来接下那个案子
You want us to take it on as a pro bono.

705
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,870
我需要的仅仅是你每周花一个小时监督我
All I need is one hour a week of supervision,

706
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,640
如果我需要出庭  你得陪着我
and if I need to appear in court, you come with me.

707
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,610
我知道我要求很多  但是
I know that that's a lot to ask, but--

708
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,350
瑞秋  我希望我能告诉你我有额外的一小时给你
Rachel, I wish I could tell you I had an extra hour to give,

709
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,130
-但我没有  -杰西卡  拜托了
- but I don't. - Jessica, please.

710
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,740
如果你能跟我来见见这个男人
If you would just come with me and meet this man--

711
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,060
不  这正是我所说的
No, this is my point.

712
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,790
我才发现我们拥有的将律所扶上正轨的时间
I just found out we have less time than I thought we did

713
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,050
比我们想得更少
to get this firm back on its feet,

714
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,050
我负担不起花任何额外的时间在其他事情上
and I can't afford to spend one minute on anything else.

715
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,090
但  我真的
But, I mean, really--

716
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,530
瑞秋  我很抱歉
Rachel, I'm sorry.

717
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,840
失陪了
Now if you'll excuse me.

718
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,410
谢谢你
Thank you.

719
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,140
谢谢你的心理咨询师吧  罗先生
Thank your counselor, Mr. Rowe.

720
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,950
-我会的  -你一定很信任他
- I will. - You must trust him a lot

721
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,580
才敢让他知道你的打算
to let him in on your little arrangement.

722
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,510
我确实信任
I do.

723
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,260
他帮了我  虽然他不认同这件事
He helped me, even though he doesn't approve of this.

724
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,930
听起来你也不太认同
Sounds like you don't either.

725
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,750
这与我认同与否毫不相关
It's not up to me to approve or not.

726
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,330
你来这里就是为了告诉我这些
Is that what you came down here to tell me?

727
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,040
不  我来这里是想告诉你
No, I came down here to tell you I've been doing this

728
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,150
我做这行很久了
a long time,

729
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,190
我见过很多犯人来了又走
and I've seen a lot of inmates come and go.

730
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,530
这种交易  它们并不总是很顺利的
These kind of deals, they don't always work out so well.

731
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,070
你是说我会在这待上整整两年
You saying you think I'll be here for the whole two years?

732
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,930
我是说  我希望最终结果不会变得更糟
I'm saying I hope it doesn't turn out even worse than that.

733
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,350
不是已经休市了吗
I thought the markets were closed.

734
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,820
《华尔街:  金钱永不眠》
Did you ever see "Wall Street

735
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,510
看过吗
Money never sleeps"?

736
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,870
-这是什么  -看看就知道
- What's this? - Have a look.

737
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,110
让我把话说清楚  我雇了你
Let me get this straight. I hire you,

738
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,100
结果你做的第一件事就是来找我帮忙
and the first thing you do is come to me for a favor?

739
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,010
之前你是我的租客时  我来找你帮过忙
I came to you for a favor when you were my tenant.

740
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,550
现在作为你的律师  我是来给你一个商机
Now, as your lawyer, I am coming to you with an opportunity.

741
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,590
什么意思
What are you talking about?

742
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,710
这不是一个慈善捐赠
That's not a charitable donation.

743
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,880
你接了它  你会得到该有的报酬
You do this, you'll get paid for it.

744
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,080
-多少  -足够多
- How much? - Enough.

745
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,730
我怎么知道没有风险
How do I know I'm not leaving something on the table?

746
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,370
因为我做事从来把握十足
Because I never leave anything on the table.

747
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,080
好吧
All right.

748
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,920
我不明白
You know, I don't get it.

749
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,910
你明显是个顶尖的律师
You're obviously a big-time attorney,

750
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,400
现在你却转租给我
and now you're subletting to me.

751
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,340
这是怎么一回事
What the hell happened here?

752
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,680
-你不知道吗  -我为什么会知道
- You don't know? - Why would I?

753
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,880
-谷歌一下  -这么糟啊
- Google it. - That bad?

754
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,170
我们雇了个律师
We hired a lawyer.

755
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,120
后来发现他说了谎  这毁掉了我们的声誉
Turns out he was a fraud. It ruined our reputation.

756
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,090
发现他说谎  还是你一直都知道
Turned out to be a fraud, or you knew he was a fraud?

757
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,570
晚安  斯图  明天见
Good night, Stu. See you in the morning.

758
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,650
典狱长  你这是...干什么
Warden, what are you-- what are you doing?

759
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,660
你知道迈克・罗斯
Did you know Mike Ross

760
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,140
那天晚上离开了监狱吗
left the prison grounds the other night?

761
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,450
-什么  -别跟我打哈哈
- What? - Don't bullshit me.

762
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,310
你知道他的律师  就我所知现在也是你的律师
Did you know his lawyer, who I understand is now also your lawyer,

763
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,670
贿赂了某些人把他带出去了吗
paid someone to get him out of here?

764
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,700
我完全不知道这事
I don't know anything about it.

765
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,900
那我想如果我问你
I suppose if I asked you

766
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,930
他贿赂了谁  你也会是一样的答案了
who he paid, you'd have the same answer.

767
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,420
如果下次我发现你说谎
I find out you're lying, next time,

768
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,550
进单独监禁的就会是你了
you are gonna be the one in solitary,

769
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,410
而且绝不只是一晚
and it won't be just one night.

770
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,490
-什么  -我只是在想象
- What? - I'm just thinking about

771
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,690
当这个混蛋发现
when this asshole finds out

772
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,410
你要废掉他吊销执照那招时的表情
you're gonna blow his bullshit suspension out of the water.

773
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,280
威廉  我会废掉它的
William, I am gonna blow it out of the water,

774
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,350
但我需要你先签了这个
but I'm gonna need you to sign this first.

775
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,240
史蒂芬投资集团是什么东西
What the hell is Stevens Investment Group?

776
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,770
是你以后所有交易都要由其经手的公司的名字
It's the company you're trading through from now on.

777
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,660
胡闹  他们还成我的主人了
Bullshit. They own me?

778
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,110
他们谁的主人都不是
They don't own anything.

779
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,560
只是纸面上看起来控制着你
They control you on paper,

780
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,160
除非你接下来90天想继续停业
and unless you want to shut down for the next 90 days,

781
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,470
否则就得这么办
this is what you have to do.

782
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,800
胡说
Well, bullshit.

783
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,460
那家伙要告我  你要怎么办
What are you gonna do if that guy indicts me,

784
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,990
让我签认罪协议  然后缓刑吗
cut a deal where I plead guilty, and I get probation?

785
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,560
因为如果这就是你的赢局
'Cause if this is what you consider winning,

786
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,000
那我还是换个律师比较好
I might as well find myself another lawyer.

787
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,720
好了  先生们  我准备听听辩论了
Okay, gentlemen, I'm ready to hear arguments,

788
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:33,820
但我得告诉你们
but I have to tell you,

789
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,310
除非昨晚国会出台了新法律
unless Congress passed a new law last night,

790
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,150
否则停业不会取消
this suspension stands.

791
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,340
没关系  法官大人
That's okay, Your Honor.

792
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,240
我客户的公司
My client's firm is now

793
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,960
目前是一家上市公司的子公司
the subsidiary of a holding company

794
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,550
并不使用已被吊销的营业执照
with a different trading license.

795
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,530
-什么  -文件都在这里
- What? - It's all right here.

796
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,310
这样的话
In that case,

797
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,420
我动议暂时吊销那家公司的执照
I move to have that company's license suspended.

798
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,980
出于这个原因
And that, right there, is why I'd like to ask the court

799
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,420
我申请法庭
to have Mr. Cahill removed

800
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,560
裁定卡荷尔就未来
from any investigation

801
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,130
对我当事人的所有调查进行回避
regarding my client in the future.

802
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,850
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

803
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,850
法官大人  我们曾经强烈敌对
We have an antagonistic history, Your Honor.

804
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,020
所有人都知道  而这次调查
Everyone knows it, and this action

805
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,490
无非是在找借口
is nothing more than a stunt

806
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,470
试图通过我的客户来惩罚我
designed to punish me through my client.

807
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,220
荒谬之极
This is ridiculous.

808
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,770
我已经调查威廉・萨特18个月了
I've been investigating William Sutter for 18 months.

809
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,200
而在这过去的18个月中
And in the last 18 months,

810
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,520
他什么行动都没有
he took no action,

811
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,420
而昨天  当我通知他
and then yesterday, when I informed him

812
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,290
我成为了萨特先生的律师后
I am Mr. Sutter's attorney,

813
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,760
不到5小时他就吊销了他的执照
within five hours he suspends his license,

814
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,550
现在他还想再来一次
and now he's trying to do it again.

815
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,390
这才叫赢局
That's what I call a win.

816
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,410
卡荷尔先生  这看起来可不太好
Mr. Cahill, this doesn't look good.

817
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,310
我倾向于要求你回避
I'm inclined to take you off this case.

818
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,610
法官大人  斯佩克特先生说得对
Your Honor, Mr. Specter is right.

819
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,500
我们是有过节  但我处理此案
We have history, but I've been involved

820
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,120
时间比他要长得多
in this case a lot longer than he has.

821
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,110
如果说有谁应为利益冲突回避
So if anyone has to be thrown out for a conflict,

822
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,690
那也是他  不是我
it is him, not me.

823
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,250
我哪也不去  法官大人
I'm not going anywhere, Your Honor.

824
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,370
那么就请萨特先生
Then let Mr. Sutter waive

825
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,970
声明放弃所有利益冲突权利
any claims to conflict altogether,

826
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,700
除非你想开个先例
unless, of course, you want to set a precedent

827
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,800
让所有不喜欢公诉人的被告
that any time a defendant doesn't like his prosecutor,

828
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,180
只要雇个以前跟公诉人
all he has to do is hire a lawyer

829
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,860
起过冲突的律师就能解决问题
he's gone up against before.

830
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,430
萨特先生  你想要继续雇佣你的律师
Mr. Sutter, would you like to keep your attorney

831
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,280
还是换一个呢
or hire another one,

832
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,020
因为我不会要求卡荷尔先生回避
because I am not taking Mr. Cahill off this case.

833
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,200
法官大人  我就选哈维
Harvey's my guy, Your Honor.

834
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,300
那没有其他问题的话
Then unless there's some other issue,

835
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,090
本次庭审到此结束
the court has a full docket.

836
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,730
狱警说有人来访
Guard tells you you have a visitor,

837
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,380
但不说是谁  会让人误以为
doesn't say who it is, you start thinking

838
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,090
是安吉丽娜・朱莉终于看了人家的信呢
maybe Angelina Jolie opened your letters after all.

839
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,620
坐吧  加洛
Sit down, Gallo.

840
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,810
你是来继续诬告我的吗
You here to make more false accusations?

841
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,750
我是来跟你说  从现在开始
I'm here to tell you that, as of this minute,

842
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,330
我是你的新律师
I'm your new attorney.

843
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,620
什么
Come again?

844
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,090
你需要有人帮你申请动议
You need someone to file that motion.

845
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,480
我就是那个人
I'm that someone.

846
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,700
要是我不想要你帮忙呢
What if I don't want your help?

847
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,470
那你就可以烂在这里等刑期结束了
Well, then you can rot in here for the rest of your sentence.

848
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,430
其实挺好笑的  不是吗
It's actually kind of funny, isn't it,

849
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,610
现在你努力地想要弄我出去
you fighting to get me out

850
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,850
而当初也是你花了那么大力气才把我弄进来
when you fought so hard to put me away.

851
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,760
这肯定让你痛不欲生
Must kill you.

852
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,680
我确实觉得很恶心
Makes me sick to my stomach,

853
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,690
但我会忍下去
but I'm gonna live with it,

854
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,650
因为你会给我回报的
because you're gonna give me something in return.

855
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,610
是吗  什么回报
Oh, yeah? What's that?

856
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,030
事情进行过程中
Until this thing goes through,

857
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,450
你不仅不能找迈克的麻烦
not only are you gonna keep your hands off Mike,

858
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,510
还要做他的私人保镖
you're gonna be his personal protector in here.

859
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,830
-胡说八道  -不是胡说
- Bullshit. - Not bullshit.

860
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,480
就算他放风的时候扭个脚
He so much as twists an ankle in the yard,

861
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,790
我也会撤回动议
I'll withdraw that motion.

862
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,280
你是不是忘了点什么  大人物
Now, aren't you forgetting a little something, champ?

863
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,260
我不需要你帮我做这件事
I don't need you to handle this thing for me.

864
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,840
我现在知道情况了  自己会找律师
Now that I know what's what, I'll get my own attorney.

865
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,020
你去找  我就跟法庭说
Yeah, you do that, and I'll tell the courts

866
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,350
你向我承认了曾试图给迈克下毒
that you just admitted to me that you tried to poison Mike.

867
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,010
你知道那会给你加多少年刑吗
You know how much time that's gonna add to your sentence?

868
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,020
-我什么都没做  -那真好
- I didn't do shit to him! - Good for you.

869
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,360
但你觉得他们会信谁
Who do you think they're gonna believe,

870
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,100
我这样的前任检察官
a former prosecutor like me

871
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,680
还是你这样被判刑的线人
or an informant convict like you?

872
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:45,060
当然  如果我是你的律师
Of course, if I'm your attorney,

873
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,570
我就什么都不能说了
I can't tell them any of that.

874
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,120
你这个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

875
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,560
你陷害我
You set me up.

876
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,070
一点没错
I sure as hell did.

877
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,720
所以决定权在你
So it's up to you.

878
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,310
你同意  还是不同意
You in or you out?

879
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,350
能跟你说句话吗
Can I talk to you a second?

880
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,570
什么事  路易
What is it, Louis?

881
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,990
我找不到房子
I can't find a house.

882
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,870
房子  什么房子
A house? What house?

883
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,810
我不知道什么房子的事
I don't know anything about a house,

884
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,830
特别是当这个房子
certainly not for a person

885
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,680
是为一个不相信我有能力在特定情况下
who doesn't have any confidence in my ability

886
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,530
知道他需求的人找的
to know what he's looking for in a given situation.

887
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,260
唐娜求你了  我们不能假装我什么都没说吗
Donna, please, can't we just pretend that I didn't say

888
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,580
就像我们一直以来那样
what I said, like we usually do?

889
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,570
不  路易  不行  因为我得确定
No, Louis, we can't, because I need to know

890
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,450
你至少花了点时间好好反省了
that you have spent at least one second contemplating

891
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,320
你那股无名火是从哪来的
what your little outburst was about.

892
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,030
我知道是从哪来的
I know what it was about.

893
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,040
是吗  哪来的
Really? What is that?

894
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,830
我想你了  唐娜
I miss you, Donna.

895
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,320
想念你做我秘书的一切
I miss having you as my secretary.

896
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,300
我也想你  路易
I miss you too, Louis.

897
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,940
但别误会
And don't get me wrong.

898
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,740
我没说格雷琴不好
I'm not saying Gretchen's not great.

899
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,280
谁这么说了啊
Who would?

900
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,210
我只是说...她不是你
It's just--I'm just saying she's not you.

901
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,200
-那谁是  -没人能是
- Who is? - Nobody.

902
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,060
这是你要找的东西吗
Was this the kind of thing you're looking for?

903
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,480
天呐  太完美了  还能下手吗
Oh, my God, it's perfect. Is it still available?

904
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,660
-今早有人开了价  -那我们得出个高点的
- An offer went in this morning. - We have to beat it.

905
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,670
不  路易  不用
No, Louis, we don't.

906
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,610
那个价是你开的
That offer was yours.

907
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,450
他们接受了吗
Did they take it?

908
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,840
明天就知道了
We find out tomorrow.

909
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,100
-唐娜  -不许
- Donna-- - No.

910
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,400
典狱长的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry about what happened with the warden.

911
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,460
哦
Yeah.

912
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,320
如果你有什么需要...
If you need anything--

913
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,680
我会跟你说
I'll let you know.

914
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,440
我没有  我没有告诉他们
Look, I didn't-- I didn't tell them

915
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,800
你跟我说的哈维带你出去的事
what you told me about Harvey getting you out.

916
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,320
我得让你知道  这对我很重要
I need you to know that. It's important to me.

917
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,450
好  随你怎么说吧  凯文
Yeah, whatever you say, Kevin.

918
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,030
我知道我没跟你说我为什么在这里  迈克
I know I haven't told you why I'm in here, Mike...

919
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,350
但你懂
But you don't understand.

920
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,510
我一进这里  就得注意
From the second I got here, I've had to watch

921
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,320
我说的话  每个字都得小心
what I say, every single word,

922
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,030
每天早上醒来
and every morning I get up,

923
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,370
我都提醒自己
and I remind myself

924
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,940
不要跟错误的人说错误的话
not to say the wrong thing to the wrong person,

925
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,790
没晚我上床时都会想
and every night I go to bed and think,

926
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,210
"终于又小心翼翼过完了一天"
"Another day down where I didn't."

927
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,030
你觉得我不懂这种感觉吗
Yeah, you think I don't know what that's like?

928
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,150
我在一个谎言里生活了好几年
I've been living a lie every day for years.

929
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,210
是  但你只是在保护你自己
Yeah, but you were just protecting yourself.

930
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,480
你没有家庭
You don't have a family.

931
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,880
凯文  你做了什么
Kevin, what did you do?

932
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,570
我跟妻子吵了一架
I got in a fight with my wife.

933
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,600
状况...
It was...

934
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,070
很糟糕
it was bad.

935
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,550
我们都对对方说了从未有过的过分的话
We said things to each other we never said before.

936
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,720
我离开了家
I went out.

937
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,700
喝醉了
I got drunk.

938
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,210
我开着车
I got into my car,

939
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,370
差点撞死人
and I almost killed someone.

940
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,670
之后我记得的  就是我在救护车上
Next thing I knew, I woke up in an ambulance,

941
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,270
面前坐着位警官
looking up at a police officer.

942
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,280
什么
What?

943
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,010
我犯了一个非常愚蠢的
I made one stupid,

944
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,850
非常愚蠢的错误
stupid mistake.

945
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:45,580
代价是我得离开家庭3年  而且我错过的
And it's gonna cost me three years with my family,

946
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,300
不光是他们生命中重要的时刻  朋友
and it's not just the special things, man.

947
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,300
我错过了上千次
I'm missing a thousand chances

948
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,170
早晨抱抱我的孩子的机会
to hug my kids in the morning...

949
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,510
晚上亲吻我妻子的机会
and kiss my wife good night,

950
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,760
只是因为我没有控制好自己
all because I couldn't control myself.

951
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,760
你跟你妻子是因为什么吵的架
What were you fighting with your wife about?

952
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,320
你说你在保护家庭  是什么意思
What do you mean, you were trying to protect your family?

953
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,690
凯文
Kevin.

954
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,880
我...不能说
I--yeah, I can't.

955
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,610
不能说
I just can't.

956
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,780
好
Okay.

957
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,440
我接受
I'll do it.

958
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,630
-你说什么  -你的法律援助案件
- Excuse me? - Your pro bono.

959
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,450
明早带文件来
Bring me the file tomorrow morning.

960
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,230
抱歉杰西卡  我能问问为什么吗
Jessica, I'm sorry. Can I just ask why?

961
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,390
原因重要吗
What does it matter?

962
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,660
对我重要
It matters to me.

963
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,620
我在外面忙了一天
I've been out all day,

964
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,960
尝试招揽客户  但很艰难
trying to drum up business, and it hasn't been easy.

965
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,730
所以从现在开始  人们搜索我们的名字时
So from now on, when people Google our name,

966
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,330
我更希望他们看到
I'd rather they see,

967
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,530
"皮尔逊-斯佩克特律所救下无辜之人"
"Innocent man freed by Pearson Specter"

968
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,750
而不是"曼哈顿律所雇佣诈骗犯"
than "Manhattan law firm hires a fraud."

969
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,840
谢谢你
Thank you.

970
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,320
晚安  瑞秋
Good night, Rachel.

971
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,440
肖恩  你来干什么
What are you doing here, Sean

972
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,760
你很清楚我来干什么
Oh, you know what I'm doing here.

973
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,190
你怎么想的  要法庭强迫我回避我的案子
What were you thinking, trying to get me thrown off my own case?

974
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:33,200
他在找我麻烦  我得做点事保证他的信任
He was coming at me. I had to do something to keep his trust.

975
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,160
那我告诉你
Well, for your information,

976
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,440
如果我被要求回避了
if I get thrown off this case,

977
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,030
那个你不知道的
that deal that you don't know about

978
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,700
让某人提前出来的协议  也就不存在了
getting that certain someone out early doesn't exist anymore.

979
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,780
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know that?

980
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,470
不  我觉得你不知道
No, I don't think you do,

981
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,130
因为如果不是我灵机一动
because if I hadn't pulled that shit out of my ass,

982
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,010
这件事已经黄了
this whole thing would've been for nothing.

983
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,030
你在高兴什么
What are you so pleased with yourself about?

984
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,570
没什么  只是...
Nothing. It's just...

985
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,660
你一开始就不想让我接这个案子
you didn't want me to take this case,

986
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,850
现在又因为我辩护太得力
and now you're getting pissed at me

987
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,990
而对我不满
because I'm too good a job defending my client.

988
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,470
你要这么说的话...
Now that you put it that way...

989
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,170
你的招接得很漂亮  肖恩
It was a good fix, Sean.

990
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,560
你的招出得也不错  哈维
It was a good move, Harvey.

991
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,690
想去喝一杯吗
Want to get a drink?

992
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,650
不如就在这儿喝怎么样
Why don't we just have one here?

993
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,480
最后一杯  恐怕我们很久都不能一起喝酒了
This might be the last one that we have together for a long time.

994
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:11,640
为什么
Why?

995
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,850
现在你还没有针对我客户的动作
As of right now, you have no action pending against my client.

996
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,400
但明早就有了
But as of tomorrow, I do,

997
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,020
因为明早起诉书就要提出了
'cause those indictments are coming down in the morning.
