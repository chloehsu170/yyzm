这是你最后一次骗爸爸了

23
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,190
-哈维  -鲍比
?- Harvey-- - Bobby

24
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,070
你滚出我父亲的房子
You get the hell out of my father's house.

25
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,620
我要么拿走那个东西
I am walking out of here with that thing in my hands,

26
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,500
要么明早把你的律所置于死地
or I am putting your firm in the ground.

27
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,090
-画是你的了  -你跟我说过那幅画
- Take the painting. - You told me that painting

28
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,780
是你跟你妈妈唯一的快乐回忆
was the one happy memory you had of your mother.

29
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,840
我今天填的每张申请表
Every application I filled out today

30
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,650
{\an8}安全与保密信息
你受过任何安保训练吗
你是否曾被判刑

31
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,610
都问我有没有被判过罪
asked if I was a convicted felon.

32
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,410
我选了那个选项  没有地方会雇我
None of these places are gonna hire me after I check that box.

33
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,320
去法律诊所不是重回正轨的唯一途径
A legal clinic isn't the only way to get back.

34
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,380
你是在给我提供一份教书的工作吗
Are you offering me a teaching job?

35
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,210
-没错  -这很好玩吗
- I am. - You think this is funny?

36
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,390
想到我们的老师上周还在坐牢就快把我笑死了
Cracks me up that our teacher was in prison last week.

37
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,150
你想的从来只有
All you care about is proving to me

38
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,770
向我证明你该做管理合伙人
that you should be managing partner,

39
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,090
即使全世界的人都认为你不应该
when everyone in the world knows that you shouldn't.

40
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,420
所以如果你认为我会让你成为管理合伙人
So, if you think I'm gonna let you be managing partner,

41
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,540
那你真是脑子坏掉了
you're out of your goddamn mind!

42
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,440
有个学生告诉了他父母你进过监狱
One of the students told his parents that you were in prison.

43
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,050
我试着向他们解释  但...
I tried to explain the situation to them, but...

44
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,140
很抱歉  迈克
I'm sorry, Mike.

45
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,670
他们都要走了  唐娜
They're all leaving, Donna--

46
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,260
先杰西卡  现在又是迈克
first Jessica and now Mike.

47
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,270
他们是我的家人
They're family.

48
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,740
你一直说的像只有我们是你的家人一样
You always talk like we're your only family.

49
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,650
你得处理好和你母亲之间的关系
You need to go make things right with your mother.

50
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,330
迈克  你怎么在这儿
Mike, what are you doing here?

51
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,980
学校不是7点上课吗
I thought school started at 7:00.

52
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,670
课是开始了  只是带课的不是我了
It does. I just don't work there anymore.

53
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,470
什么
What?

54
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,360
怎么回事
What happened?

55
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,710
有个学生告诉家长我是个罪犯
One of the students told their parents I was a criminal.

56
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,570
他们去找了总主教
They went to the archdiocese, and...

57
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,910
沃克神父也没办法
you know, Father Walker had no choice.

58
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,420
你昨晚怎么没跟我说
Why didn't you tell me this last night?

59
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,220
因为我不想破坏你的兴头
'Cause I didn't want to step on your moment.

60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,990
路易的邀约让你那么开心
You were so happy about Louis' offer.

61
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,400
你打算怎么办
So what are you gonna do?

62
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,520
我要花一天  享受我作为自由人的生活
I'm gonna take the day to enjoy my life as a free man.

63
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,860
明天
And then tomorrow...

64
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,820
我要再重新开始
I'm gonna start all over again.

65
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:08,800
{\an8}七年前

66
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,400
雷在楼下等你
Ray's downstairs waiting for you.

67
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,240
我没叫他来
I didn't call him.

68
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,970
是我叫的
I did.

69
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,210
他拿了你的黑西装和过夜包
He's got your black suit and an overnight bag,

70
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,790
他会送你去火车站
and he's taking you to the train station.

71
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,020
唐娜
Donna...

72
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,260
你得去参加你父亲的葬礼  哈维
You need to go to your father's funeral, Harvey.

73
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,730
我不能  这里事太多
I can't. There's too much going on here.

74
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,130
听我说  你刚刚经历了丧亲
Listen to me--you just suffered a huge loss,

75
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,110
却还一副照常办公的样子
and you're acting like it's business as usual.

76
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,210
我是一副我有工作要做的样子
I'm acting like I've got a job to do.

77
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,690
哈维  如果你不为他哀悼
Harvey, if you don't grieve him--

78
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,940
我会以我自己的方式哀悼父亲
I will grieve my father in my own way.

79
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,380
你不会的
No, you won't.

80
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,240
你只会封闭情感  硬撑下去  但是
You'll bottle it up, and you'll try to move on, but--

81
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,370
她也会去  唐娜
She's gonna be there, Donna.

82
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,950
我知道
I know she is.

83
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,160
但葬礼的重点不是她
But this funeral isn't about her.

84
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,810
也不是你
And it's not about you.

85
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,710
是你父亲
It's about your dad...

86
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,460
那个你在这世界上爱他超过任何人的人
the man you love more than anyone in the entire world.

87
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,410
如果你不去跟他道别
And if you don't say good-bye to him,

88
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,540
你会后悔一辈子
you're gonna regret that for the rest of your life.

89
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,120
唐娜  你来这儿干什么
Donna, what are you doing here?

90
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,140
问题是  你怎么还在这儿
The question is, what are you still doing here?

91
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,710
{\an8}如今

92
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,630
我给你定了早8点去波士顿的班机
I made you an 8:00 reservation to Boston,

93
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,430
所以你现在应该在路上了
which means you should be halfway there by now.

94
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,040
我错过了班机
I missed my flight.

95
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,030
哈维  你从不会错过班机
Harvey, you never miss your flight.

96
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,990
上次你说你错过时
And the last time you said you did,

97
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,330
也是在对我撒谎
you were lying to me then, too.

98
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,570
-唐娜  -告诉我
- Donna... - Please tell me

99
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,260
你不是改主意不想见她了吧
you didn't change your mind about seeing her.

100
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,170
我没有
I didn't.

101
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,470
那问题在哪
Then what's the problem?

102
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,700
我已经七年没见她了
I haven't seen the woman in seven years.

103
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,380
而上次
The last time I did--

104
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,020
我知道上次发生了什么
I know what happened the last time you did.

105
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,410
听我说
Listen to me.

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,760
每天  你都在这个世界里
Every day you go out in the world,

107
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
想办法赢一把
and you find a way to win.

108
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,160
你就是这样的人  你就做这个
It's who you are. It's what you do.

109
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,400
唐娜  这无关输赢
Donna, this isn't about winning.

110
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,490
是有关的
Yes, it is.

111
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,470
但这次这事并不是只关系到一个人
But it's not just one person in this case,

112
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:09,980
而是两个
it's two,

113
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,630
现在  你们都在输
and right now you're both losing.

114
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,170
如果我做不到呢
What if I can't do it?

115
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,270
那就别上飞机
Then don't get on that plane.

116
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,240
但那边的那个包
But that bag sitting over there

117
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,050
让我觉得你愿意原谅她了
tells me that you're ready to forgive her.

118
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,850
如果是这样  你只需要原谅就行
And if you are, then that's all you need to do.

119
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,520
{\an8}诉讼双雄 第六季 第十二集

120
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,900
-纳森  -你还记得我
- Nathan. - You remember me.

121
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,250
我记得每个人  你来做什么
I remember everyone. What are you doing here?

122
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,700
我来是因为你去送简历时
I'm here because I may not have been there

123
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,890
我虽然没在诊所
when you dropped off your résumé,

124
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,840
但那里还是归我管的
but I still run that clinic.

125
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,870
我是来给你份工作的
I'm here to offer you a job.

126
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,010
-我不明白  -海克特・苏雷兹
- I don't understand. - Hector Suarez.

127
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,400
你应该也记得他吧
I'm assuming you remember him, too, right?

128
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,690
-他怎么了  -你走后
- What about him? - Well, after you left,

129
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,210
我把你写的文件捡回来了
I picked up your file.

130
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,250
我猜猜  你把他留在了国内
Don't tell me--you kept him in the country.

131
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,810
不  迈克  是你做到的
No, Mike. You did.

132
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,260
我还想"这人或许有天真能当上律师"
I thought, "Maybe this guy will become a lawyer someday."

133
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,820
然后去年我在报纸上读到了你的事
And then I read about you in the paper last year

134
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,250
才得知你没当上
and found out you never did.

135
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,970
你知道我两次假扮律师
So you knew that I faked being a lawyer twice,

136
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,600
却还来给我一份工作
and you're still here to offer me a job?

137
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,730
我本不会  但我看到了这个
I wouldn't be, except for this.

138
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,680
你说了实话
You told the truth.

139
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,990
就我看来
As far as I'm concerned, 

140
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,670
这意味着你值得我冒险试试
that means you're worth taking a chance on.

141
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,330
你还真是个圣母
Wow, you really are a do-gooder.

142
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,630
我不是为你
I'm not here to do good for you.

143
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,520
是为了我的诊所
I'm here to do good for my clinic,

144
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,030
因为我能雇城内顶尖律所
because I'm hiring a partner-level attorney

145
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,680
能达到合伙人级别的律师
from one of the top firms in the city

146
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,930
还只付他倒咖啡的小哥一样低的工资
for the price of the kid who gets me my coffee.

147
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,470
你还有专给你倒咖啡的小哥
You have a kid who gets you coffee?

148
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,840
没有  付不起
No, we can't afford that.

149
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,270
但如果付得起  我会付他跟你一样的工资
But if we could, I'd pay him what I'm gonna pay you.

150
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,870
你来不来
So are you in or not?

151
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,500
什么时候上班
When do I start?

152
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,790
我从没见过你穿西装
I don't think I've ever seen you in a suit before.

153
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,700
哈维  你来了
Harvey, you made it.

154
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,650
我绝不会错过
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

155
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,560
哈维  听我说
Harvey, listen, um--

156
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,270
你不用说  我知道
You don't have to say it. I know.

157
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,120
-她也在  -不止如此
- She's here. - It's not just that.

158
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,910
她问她能不能为爸爸说几句
She asked if she could say a few words about Dad.

159
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,740
怎么  你要让她说吗
And what, you're gonna let her?

160
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,130
-哈维  -只要我在这里
- Harvey-- - She is not saying

161
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,000
她就说不了一个字
a single word as long as I'm here.

162
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,810
不  她能  如果你当着我孩子的面
Yes, she is, and if you make a scene in front of my kids

163
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,980
在我们父亲下葬时闹事
on the day that we put our dad into the ground,

164
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,390
我发誓一定把你打得屁滚尿流
I swear to God, I will beat the shit out of you,

165
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,680
因为她是我的母亲
because she's my mother,

166
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,600
我会让她致辞的
and I'm gonna let her say her piece.

167
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,640
哈维  见到你很高兴
Harvey... It's good to see you.

168
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,000
莉莉  我也想说我很高兴  但是
Wish I could say the same thing, Lily, but...

169
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,710
那就是撒谎了
I'd be lying if I did.

170
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,870
很抱歉你会这么想
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

171
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,190
不管你相信与否  我爱你的父亲
And whether you believe it or not, I loved your father.

172
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,340
他的离世让我很痛苦
And I am sad to see him go.

173
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,730
是的  我不相信
Yeah, well, I don't believe it,

174
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,000
我来也不是为了探望你
and I didn't come here to see you.

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,450
而是来纪念我的父亲
I came here to honor my father,

176
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,430
你就上去吧  说完你想说的
so get up there, say what you're gonna say,

177
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,590
快点把这事搞定
and let's get this over with.

178
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,090
哈维
Harvey.

179
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,180
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

180
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,810
我想跟你谈谈
I wanted to talk to you.

181
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,940
真不敢相信  太好了
I can't believe it. This is wonderful.

182
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,720
不知道今晚你愿不愿意和我一起吃饭
I thought maybe you wanted to get dinner tonight.

183
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,260
没有什么比与你共进晚餐
There is nothing I would rather do

184
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,580
更让我高兴的了  但是今晚不行
than get dinner with you, but I can't tonight.

185
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,620
真希望你提前给我打了电话
I wish you would have called.

186
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,460
我想打  但是
I would have, but, uh...

187
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,050
你没有我的电话号码
You didn't have my phone number.

188
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,600
是的
No, I didn't.

189
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,150
明晚怎么样
How about tomorrow night?

190
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,490
我没打算在这里过两
I wasn't really planning on being here two nights.

191
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,670
我的律所现在
My firm is in a...

192
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,780
正处于危险期
vulnerable spot right now.

193
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,560
哈维  今晚有儿童艺术展
Harvey, it's the kids' art show.

194
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,560
一年举行一次  我不能取消
It's once a year. I can't cancel it.

195
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,310
你知道吗  这真是太傻了
You know what? This is silly.

196
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,120
你这么大老远飞过来
You flew all the way up here.

197
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,820
不
No.

198
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,070
我们可以明晚一起吃饭
We can do it tomorrow night.

199
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,520
我猜猜  你接受了这份工作
Don't tell me. You took the job.

200
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,980
事实上  在今早之前  我根本
Actually, until this morning, I didn't think

201
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,730
没想到我有可能得到这份工作
there was a chance in hell I was getting this job.

202
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,430
听起来你有个做前台的朋友
Sounds to me like you had a friend at the front desk

203
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,100
把你简历放在了最上面
who put your resume at the top of the pile.

204
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,970
听起来我欠那个朋友一杯啤酒
Sounds to me like I owe that person a beer.

205
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,510
确认一下  那个人就是我
Just so we're clear-- I'm that guy.

206
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,530
我听得懂
I get the picture.

207
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,900
迈克  欢迎来到这间律所
Welcome to the clinic, Mike.

208
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,890
谢谢你  奥利佛
Thanks, Oliver.

209
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,710
-看来你跟奥利佛打过招呼了  -是的
- I see you met Oliver here. - I did.

210
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,580
-我们相处得十分融洽  -不错
- We got along right away. - Good, good.

211
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,400
开头很不错
Well, you're off to a good start.

212
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,750
我想现在就剩下告诉我
I guess the only thing left is for you

213
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,850
办公桌在哪了
to show me where my desk is.

214
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,070
对  就在那间办公室里面
Right. It's, uh, right inside that office right there.

215
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,820
我没想到我会有间办公室
I didn't think I was getting an office.

216
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,680
就因为我付得工资低
Look, just because I'm paying you dick

217
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,510
不代表我会不提供你工作必备的用具
doesn't mean I'm not gonna give you the tools for the job.

218
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,120
我的工作到底是什么  因为就我看来
What exactly is my job? 'Cause as far as I can tell,

219
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,030
我是这里唯一一个有办公室的人
I'm the only one here with an office.

220
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,780
所有人注意
Everybody listen up.

221
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,820
从今天起你们有新主管了
You have a new supervisor starting today.

222
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,020
他叫迈克・罗斯
His name is Mike Ross.

223
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,060
迈克来自皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所
Mike is from Pearson Specter Litt,

224
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,390
他懂的法律知识比你们加起来的都多
and he knows more about law than all of you combined.

225
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,460
所以  迈克说什么你们就照做
So, if Mike tells you to do something, you do it.

226
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,510
我无意质疑世界新格局
I don't mean to question the new world order,

227
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,800
但想问他的头衔是什么
but what is his title?

228
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,540
问得好  玛莉莎
Great question, Marissa.

229
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,140
负责监督你们的高管
senior individual in charge of you?

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,240
还有别的问题吗  我看没有了
Any more queries? I didn't think so.

231
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,090
好了  都继续工作吧  抓紧
All right, back to work. Let's go.

232
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,410
你当时说这么做是为你自己
You really weren't kidding

233
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,870
还真不是开玩笑的
when you said you were doing this for you.

234
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,080
没错
No, I wasn't.

235
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,120
我想办法用这点薪水给这个位置找人
I've been trying to get somebody in this position

236
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,670
已经找了十年
for this money for the last ten years,

237
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,340
既然我现在找到了
and now that I have...

238
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,780
就得好好利用起来
I'm gonna take full advantage of it.

239
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,580
那你现在最好回到自己办公室里
Then why don't you go back to wherever your office is

240
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,970
今年就不用再出来了
and stay there for the rest of the year?

241
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,760
因为我得忙着在这大显身手呢
'Cause I'll be busy kicking ass out here.

242
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,770
就等你这句话了
That's what I like to hear.

243
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,650
想在这里订个好座位应该找谁
Hey, who do you have to know around here to get a good table?

244
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,130
我的天
Jesus Christ.

245
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,910
是我眼花了
Do my eyes deceive me,

246
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,990
还是你长得真的太像我哥哥
or do you look just like my big brother,

247
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,150
只是更老更胖更混蛋
only older, fatter, and douchier?

248
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,760
感谢你注意到了  变成这样不容易
I appreciate you noticing. I put in a lot of effort.

249
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,160
说真的  哈维  你怎么会在这里
Seriously, Harvey, why are you here?

250
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,490
我认为是时候和母亲重归于好了
I thought it was time to, uh, make my peace with Mom.

251
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,650
哈维  太好了
Harvey, that's great.

252
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,120
这些年里你们的摩擦太多
But, uh, a lot has been said over the years.

253
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,050
你不能就这样出现在母亲面前
You can't just show up on Mom's door.

254
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,070
事实上我已经见过她了
Actually, I already did.

255
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,890
什么  什么时候
What? When?

256
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,870
我去了大学里
I went over to the college.

257
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,620
她今晚要忙着为学生举办艺术展开幕
She's having an art opening tonight for her students,

258
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,300
所以我们约好明晚在此共进晚餐
so we're gonna have dinner here tomorrow night.

259
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,210
那我肯定给你们安排座位
Well, then I will get you a table.

260
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,930
你要做的是
And what you're going to do

261
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,410
取消掉你预定的不管什么狗屁豪华酒店
is cancel whatever fancy bullshit hotel you booked,

262
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,120
你今晚得和我们待在一起
and you're going to stay the night with us.

263
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,080
马库斯  拜托  我可住在里兹大使套房
Marcus, come on, I'm at the Ambassador Suite at the Ritz.

264
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,010
别想拒绝我
Don't think of saying no

265
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,210
因为我会告诉凯蒂和孩子们你来了
because I'm going to tell Katie and the kids that you're here.

266
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,770
你们提供客房服务吗
You guys offer room service?

267
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,720
如果你说的客房服务是指
If by "Room service,"

268
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,870
提供纤丝奶酪和低盐全麦饼干
you mean string cheese and Triscuits,

269
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,750
是的  我们的确有客房服务
oh, yeah, we've got room service.

270
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,660
好吧  那就把我算上
All right, well, then count me in.

271
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,110
玛莉莎  是吗  我是迈克
Marissa, right? Mike.

272
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,230
我知道  新老板
I know. The new boss.

273
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,400
怎么了
What?

274
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,580
没什么  只是在我以前的律所
It's nothing-- It's just where I come from,

275
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,390
老板们从来不骑车上班
the, uh--the bosses don't bike to work.

276
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,510
我想这里不是皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所
I guess this is no Pearson Specter Litt.

277
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,560
这里不是  其实这正是我来的原因
No, it's not, which is actually why I came here.

278
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,870
我很高兴如此  因为你可以
I'm glad, because there are a lot of people here

279
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,640
帮到这里很多人  但我不是其中之一
who could really use your help, but I'm not one of them.

280
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,420
你不是还在上法学院的学生吗
Aren't you still a law student?

281
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,080
是一个自从到这里就没输过的法学院学生
A law student who's won every case I've had since I've been here. 

282
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,810
不错  那么我想这意味着普莱斯一案
Great, so I guess that means you have everything under control

283
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,040
都尽在你掌控之中了
on the Price case, then?

284
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,600
-你才刚来怎么就  -我阅读速度很快
- You just got here. How did you-- - I'm a fast reader.

285
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,420
玛莉莎  我并不想在我上班的第一天
Marissa, I'm not trying to throw my weight around here

286
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:13,960
就指手画脚
on the first day,

287
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,970
但是根据她的资料
but according to her file,

288
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,430
普莱斯小姐错过了她的开庭日期
Miss Price missed her court date,

289
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,770
所以我需要知道你的计划
which means I need to know what your plan is.

290
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,140
我的计划是让普莱斯小姐解释说她是单身母亲
My plan is to have Miss Price explain that she is a single mother

291
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,940
住在一间好几个月来窗户破损
living in an apartment with a broken window

292
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,060
而且没有暖气的公寓里
and no heat for months,

293
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,340
他们还想要把她赶走
and they're trying to kick her out.

294
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,180
如果你只是要告诉法官
And if all you're gonna do is tell the judge

295
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,270
这不公平  你会输的
that it's not fair, you're gonna lose.

296
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,870
-你需要法律依据  -我有法律依据
- You need legal foundation. - I have legal foundation.

297
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,410
伯格诉柯西克一案
Berger V. Chozick--

298
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,370
如果重要的要求没有得到解决
tenants are permitted to seek injunctive relief

299
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,470
租户是可以寻求法令救济的
if vital repair requests have gone unanswered.

300
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,080
那么我希望你还有后备计划  因为
Then I hope you have backup, 'cause the attorneys

301
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,570
对方律师们在过去的六年里
representing the other side have kicked out

302
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,280
已经赶走了300名租户
300 tenants in the past six years,

303
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,820
也就是说他们有点真本事
which means they are not messing around.

304
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,540
我也是
I'm not either, 

305
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,000
所以我请了普莱斯小姐明天3点来一趟
which is why I have Miss Price coming in at 3:00 tomorrow.

306
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,330
所以还有什么我可以帮到你的吗
So is there anything else I can help you with?

307
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,550
或者你可以
Or maybe you can spend some time

308
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,200
花些时间在别人的案子上
on some of the other people's cases around here.

309
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,220
路易  我需要你帮忙
Louis, I need your help.

310
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,040
-当然  怎么了  -泰迪・道尔来了电话
- Of course. What is it? - Teddy Doyle just called.

311
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,050
他遇到了紧急情况
He has an emergency.

312
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,400
所以是哈维需要我的帮助
So you mean Harvey needs my help.

313
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,280
-路易  -唐娜
- Louis-- - Donna,

314
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,290
有哪怕一个我该帮他的理由吗
give me one good reason why I should help him.

315
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,660
你不是在帮哈维  路易
You're not helping Harvey, Louis.

316
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,920
你是在帮律所  泰迪是我们公司的客户
You're helping the firm. Teddy is a client of all of us.

317
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,560
不  哈维说的很清楚  我和他没关系了
No, Harvey made it clear that there is no us.

318
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,680
路易  哈维正经历着一些烦恼
Louis, Harvey's going through something right now.

319
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,210
他那股无名火并不是冲你
His outburst wasn't about you.

320
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,310
你信什么是你的自由
You can believe whatever you want,

321
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,240
但哈维对我破口大骂  现在却连亲自
but Harvey lashed out at me, and now he's not even man enough

322
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,070
来求我帮忙的胆量都没有
to come to me to ask me for help himself?

323
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,990
我凭什么帮他任何忙
Why should I even lift a finger to help him?

324
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,940
因为他想和他母亲和好
Because he went to go make things right with his mother.

325
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,500
他之所以这么做是因为骂你给他的感受很糟
And he did it because of how he felt after he lashed out at you.

326
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,780
否则  他现在就在亲自处理泰迪的案子了
Otherwise, he'd be taking care of Teddy himself.

327
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,410
所以你到底帮不帮他
So you want to help him or not?

328
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,550
需要我做什么
What do you need me to do?

329
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,970
迈克  家里怎么乱成这样
Mike? What's going on?

330
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,620
瑞秋  你不是八点才到家吗
Rachel. I thought you weren't getting home till 8:00.

331
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,880
-已经八点半了  -我都忘了时间了
- It's 8:30. - I guess I lost track of time.

332
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,030
我一直忙着整理这些文件
I have just been buried in this paperwork.

333
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,880
看得出来  我们是被审计了吗
Yeah, I can see that. Are we being audited?

334
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,510
我找到工作了
I got a job.

335
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,020
我本来要立刻打电话告诉你的
And I would have called you right away,

336
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,510
但是从我走进法律诊所开始就一直很忙
but I've been swamped from the minute I walked into the clinic.

337
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,490
你在法律诊所找到了一份工作
You got a job at a legal clinic?

338
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,140
-迈克  这真是太棒了  -是啊
- Mike, that's amazing. - Yeah, it is.

339
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,810
是的  他们知道我的事
Yes, they know about me.

340
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,530
事实上  那正是我被录用的原因
In fact, it's the reason I got hired.

341
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,120
我猜猜看  他们很聪明得明白
Let me guess.  They were smart enough to appreciate

342
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,690
雇佣和你同样经验的人
they can get someone with your experience

343
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,360
要花比你贵十倍的价格
for ten cents on the dollar.

344
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,790
就是这样
You got it.

345
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,790
确切来说是3.5万美元一年
$35,000 a year to be exact.

346
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,940
也就是说
Mm! Which means...

347
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,720
我们现在就应该开始打包了
We should probably start packing up the place now,

348
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,740
因为我们肯定是住不起这里了
'cause we definitely cannot afford to live here anymore.

349
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,090
我愿意和你住在鞋盒里
I would live in a shoebox with you

350
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,140
只要你开心
if it meant you were happy.

351
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,700
我觉得你是说你愿意和我住在鞋盒里
Aw, I think you meant that you would live in a shoebox

352
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,190
只要泰餐店还外送
as long as the Thai place still delivered.

353
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,710
-还有寿司店  -当然了
- And the sushi place. - Of course.

354
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,850
-要来一瓶吗  -开玩笑吗
- Want one? - You kidding me?

355
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,560
在读《粉红女孩》第七遍以后
After reading "Pinkalicious" for the seventh time,

356
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,120
我需要六瓶
I need a six-pack.

357
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,310
哄他们睡觉的感觉很棒
It was nice putting them to bed.

358
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,770
等你一年365天每天如此之后再看感受吧
Oh, yeah, let's hear you say that after doing it 365 days a year.

359
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,090
我还以为大多数时候是凯蒂哄他们睡觉
I thought Katie put them to bed most nights.

360
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,760
是啊  我就是替她说的
Yeah. I was saying it for her.

361
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,640
谢谢你让我住下  马库斯
Thanks for making me stay over, Marcus.

362
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,880
也许明晚过后
Well, maybe after tomorrow night,

363
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,080
你能多来几次
you can do it more often.

364
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,360
也许吧
Maybe.

365
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,700
谢谢大家的到来
Thank you all for coming.

366
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,620
我是莉莉
I'm Lily.

367
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,830
我和戈登结婚将近30年
I was married to Gordon for almost 30 years.

368
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,990
但没满30年  而正因为如此
We didn't make it the whole 30, and for a long time,

369
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,470
有很长一段时间  我认为自己是个失败者
I considered myself a failure because of that.

370
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,740
但是戈登没有
But Gordon didn't.

371
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,330
在我们离婚几年后
A few years after our divorce,

372
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,390
我想要为婚姻出了问题向他道歉
I wanted to apologize for things not working out.

373
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,670
他笑了笑说
He just smiled and said,

374
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,550
"莉莉  你说什么傻话呢
"Lily, what the hell are you talking about?

375
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,510
我们在一起是有成果的
We achieved something together

376
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,250
是我们单独绝对达不到的成果"
that neither one of us could have done on our own."

377
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,880
我们的儿子...
Our sons...

378
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,900
哈维和马库斯
Harvey and Marcus.

379
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,140
戈登出门的时候  总会打电话回家
When Gordon was on the road, he would call home...

380
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,280
每天六个电话来询问他们
Six times a day to check on them.

381
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,740
他们晚餐吃饱了吗
Did they eat enough dinner?

382
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,040
他们作业做完了吗
Had they done homework?

383
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,480
马库斯考了多少分
How many points did Marcus score?

384
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,830
哈维拿到他舞会用的晚礼服了吗
Did Harvey get his tux for the prom?

385
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,830
戈登这辈子有太多值得骄傲的事情
Gordon was proud of a lot of things in his life,

386
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,840
但是什么也不能
but none of it compared

387
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,420
和他们相提并论
to how proud he was of them.

388
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,370
他俩就是他的一切
They were his everything.

389
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,070
不管他身处何地
No matter where he is...

390
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,120
我知道此时此刻他也还在守护着他们
I know he is watching over them right now.

391
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,720
-你来干什么  -做我的工作
- What are you doing here? - Doing my job.

392
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,890
这是我的案子  不是你的
This is my case, not yours.

393
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,430
不  玛莉莎
No, Marissa.

394
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,330
这是我们的案子  我们是同一战线的
It's our case. We're on the same side.

395
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,900
如果你听听我的话  也许能学到一些东西
And if you'd just listen to me, you might learn something.

396
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,020
-比如呢  -比如经验老道的律师
- Like what? - Like the ways

397
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,740
可能会对你耍的花招
experienced attorneys can trick you.

398
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,530
我才不会被耍  所以
I'm not gonna get tricked, so...

399
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,050
如果你不介意  我得去见我的当事人了
if you don't mind, I'd like to meet with my client.

400
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,240
我已经见过她了
I've already met with her.

401
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,370
我还没到你就见了她
You met her without me?

402
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,690
-什么时候的事  -半个小时前 
- When did you do this? - Half hour ago.

403
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,440
你约的三点  所以我叫她两点半过来
You said 3:00, so I called her in at 2:30

404
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,240
因为我知道你不会给我和她见面的机会
because I knew you wouldn't give me the chance to meet her,

405
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,770
就像我知道对方律师
just like I know the other side

406
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,750
会趁你不在时去接近她
is gonna approach her when you're not there.

407
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,050
-他们不能这么做  -为什么
- They can't do that. - Why?

408
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,700
因为这样不公平吗 
Because it's unfair?

409
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,960
-因为这是违法的  -只有她提起诉讼才算
- Because it's illegal. - Only if she pursues them,

410
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,620
这是不可能发生的  因为他们会找到
which she'll never do because they're gonna find out

411
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,720
她身上的薄弱点  然后他们会
whatever her weak spots are, and then they're gonna offer her

412
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,770
提出恰好适合她的要求
exactly the amount she needs to get by,

413
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,450
之后她就会接受
and then she's gonna take it.

414
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,260
如果她这么做  她最后会落得无家可归
If she does that, she'll end up homeless.

415
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,530
这就是我们需要为防止此事做准备的原因
Which is why we need to be prepared for it to happen.

416
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,870
现在  你愿不愿意一起处理这个案子了
Now, do you want to work on this thing together or not?

417
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,270
我很抱歉在你来之前
I'm sorry I didn't tell you

418
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,580
没告诉你她会致辞的事
that she was gonna speak before you got here.

419
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,070
只是我真的没有跟你坦白的勇气
I just didn't have it in me to have it out with you.

420
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,500
没关系  马库斯  
It's okay, Marcus.

421
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,550
她感动了你  对吗
She got to you, didn't she?

422
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,310
我是为老爸难过
I'm sad about Dad.

423
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,650
没错  她用我对父亲的感情触动了我
And, yeah, she pulled on that string,

424
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,680
但是一个致辞不能弥补一切
but one speech doesn't make up for everything.

425
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,870
或许是不能
Maybe it doesn't.

426
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,760
但总得有个开头
But you have to start somewhere.

427
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,690
没错
Yeah.

428
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,470
我得动身回去了
I'm gonna head back home.

429
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,380
别这样  哈维  来家里守灵吧
Oh, come on, Harvey, come to the house for the wake.

430
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,630
我工作上还有些事情要做
I got a few things I got to take care of at work.

431
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,350
别瞎扯  哈维  你不是为了工作走
Oh, come on, Harvey, you're not leaving because of work.

432
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,940
是时候放下了
It's time to let things go.

433
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,610
我已经说过好多次暖器坏了
I complained about the heat not working a million times.

434
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,390
房东总是说他会修的
Landlord always says he's gonna fix it,

435
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,620
然而并没有
and then nothing happens.

436
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,980
我们没钱搬家  所以我只能凑合
We couldn't afford to move, so I was just making do,

437
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,450
但之后我的小家伙  他得了哮喘
but then my little guy-- he got asthma.

438
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,720
医生说为了防止污染物危害
The doctor said that we need to keep all of the windows shut,

439
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,370
要把窗户关好
keep out the pollution,

440
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,670
但是客厅的窗户
but the window in the living room--

441
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,600
已经坏了七个月了
it's been broken for seven months.

442
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,880
我儿子才三岁
My son is only three years old.

443
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,090
听着他晚上的喘息声
The sound of him wheezing at night...

444
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,010
都不知道他能不能熬到白天
not knowing if he's gonna wake up in the morning...

445
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,800
所以我想  既然房东眼里只有钱
So I thought, "Since that slumlord only cares about money,

446
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,920
那我不付房租了
"I'm not gonna pay rent

447
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,450
直到他修好窗户和暖器
until he fixes the window and turns on the heat."

448
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,330
我很抱歉  索菲亚
I'm so sorry, Sofia.

449
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,270
-这听起来糟透了  -确实如此
- That sounds terrible. - It is.

450
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,110
没有人该过这种日子
And no one should have to live like that.

451
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,180
但是违反租约  他有理由驱逐你
But by violating your lease, he has grounds to evict you,

452
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,920
这也是为什么你要
which is why you have to give him a check

453
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,320
把欠他的钱补上这个案子才能有所进展
for the money you owe him while this case moves forward.

454
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,850
我做不到
I-I can't do that.

455
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,420
你已经没钱了
You don't have the money anymore.

456
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,410
我得买毛毯  小型取暖器
I had to buy blankets, space heaters.

457
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,570
有几个晚上AJ呼吸非常困难
There were a couple of nights that AJ's breathing was so bad,

458
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,580
我们甚至得去街边的旅馆凑合
we had to go to a motel down the street.

459
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,950
别担心  索菲亚
Don't worry, Sofia.

460
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,230
我们不仅会把你的窗户修好
Not only are we gonna get your window fixed,

461
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,300
而且我保证  你也能保住你的家
but I promise you, you'll get to keep your home, too.

462
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,670
谢谢
Thank you.

463
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,620
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

464
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,020
你指什么
What are you talking about?

465
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,770
你刚刚告诉她你能解决她的问题
You just told her you were gonna fix her problem.

466
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,100
因为我会解决她的问题的
Because I'm going to fix her problem.

467
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,830
这不是重点
That's not the point.

468
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,880
即使你认为你可以让事情好转
Even if you think you can make everything better,

469
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,570
你也不能给委托人打这样的包票
you don't guarantee that to a client.

470
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,690
我告诉你
You know what?

471
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,490
或许你对这些人漠不关心  但我关心
Maybe you don't care about these people, but I do.

472
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,810
为了确保他们能保住自己的家
And I'm willing to fight to make sure

473
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,590
我愿意战斗  我也不怕告诉她这一点
they stay in their home, and I'm not afraid to tell her that.

474
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,750
这不是你关不关心的问题
This is not about caring.

475
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,830
外面的世界很现实  而且我告诉过你
There's a real world out there, and like I told you,

476
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,400
对手都是经验老道的律师
there's an experienced lawyer on the other side

477
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,790
在等着我们犯错
looking to exploit our mistakes.

478
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,900
如果你承诺太多而实现太少
If you over-promise and under-deliver,

479
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,410
你只会让他们在这场不公平的交易中
you're just making them that much more vulnerable

480
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,250
处于更加劣势的地位
to a shitty offer.

481
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,360
这就是商业低球效应入门课教你的东西吗
Is that what they taught you in Corporate Lowballing 101?

482
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,360
{\an8}低球效应又称虚报价格技术
是社会心理学顺从技巧之一

483
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,010
什么
Excuse me?

484
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,580
你根本不在乎这些人
You don't give a shit about these people,

485
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,940
纳森和其他人
and Nathan and everyone else here

486
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,860
也许信了你的鬼话
might be buying your bullshit,

487
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,600
但我知道你为什么来这儿
but I know why you're really here.

488
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,520
我明白  你调查过我
I get it. You checked up on me.

489
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,620
我不需要调查你
I didn't need to check up on you.

490
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,760
你这种人的事迹我之前听的够多了
I've heard your story a thousand times.

491
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,610
你在你的商业律师事务所干不下去了
You couldn't hack it at your corporate law firm,

492
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,710
所以你就在这里委曲求全
so you're slumming it here until you can figure out

493
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,760
直到想办法回到你那个轻松的
a way to jump back into your cushy,

494
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,740
专门找工人麻烦的工作中去
stick-it-to-the-working-man job.

495
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,960
看来我说对了
I see that I'm right.

496
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,600
把留着你的聪明才智吧
So keep your wisdom to yourself,

497
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,050
因为我是来这里帮助人的
because I'm actually here to help people,

498
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,280
而不仅是提醒他们这世界有多残酷
not just remind them what a cruel world it is out there.

499
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,970
-哈维・斯佩克特办公室  -唐娜  是我
- Harvey Specter's office. - Donna, it's me.

500
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,030
哈维  你快到了吗
Harvey. Hey. Are you almost here?

501
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,160
你六点应该到会议室的
Because your 6:00 is in the conference room.

502
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,970
我还没回到纽约呢
I'm not back in New York yet.

503
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,300
-你是对的  唐娜  -关于什么事
- You were right, Donna. - About what?

504
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,490
如果我错过了他的葬礼
If I'd missed his funeral,

505
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,660
我永远都不会原谅我自己的
I never would be able to forgive myself.

506
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,600
祝你能和你妈妈言归于好
Good luck making up with your mom.

507
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,070
你怎么知道
How did you know?

508
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,600
因为你这一生中
Because you've never missed a flight

509
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,910
从来没有错过班机
in your entire life.

510
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,670
而且你会留下的唯一原因
And the only reason you'd stay longer

511
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,290
就是事情发展得比你预想的要好
is if things were going better than you thought they would.

512
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,290
谢谢你  唐娜
Thanks, Donna.

513
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,670
我不需要你道谢  哈维
I don't need your thanks, Harvey.

514
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,670
我很开心你能去
I'm just really happy you're there.

515
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,480
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

516
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,130
她怎么能不知道呢
How could she not know?

517
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,820
-我挑勾了  -没错
- I checked the box. - You did.

518
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,180
但是  是我把申请表给纳森的
But I was the one who brought the application to Nathan,

519
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,750
而且他跟我说不要告诉任何人
and he told me not to tell anyone.

520
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,070
为什么
Why not?

521
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,710
因为他不想让他们来评判你
Because he didn't want them to judge you.

522
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,030
我本以为大家无论如何都会知道的
I would have thought everyone knew anyway.

523
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,820
为什么
Why would you think that?

524
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,100
因为《日报》上到处都是报道
Because it was all over "The Journal."

525
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,790
我们这里不看《日报》
People here don't read "The Journal."

526
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,960
我们看《赫芬顿邮报》
We read "The Huffington Post."

527
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,760
所以他们的想法都和玛莉莎一样
So what Marissa thinks is what they all think?

528
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,670
我不知道  但是无论如何
I don't know, but for what it's worth,

529
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,700
不管纳森是否叮嘱过我
I wouldn't have said anything

530
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,420
我都不会说的
whether Nathan told me to or not.

531
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,230
这不是我该说的事情
It's not my story to tell.

532
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,970
谢谢你  奥利佛
Thank you, Oliver.

533
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,640
不客气
Yeah.

534
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,610
你做了草莓派
You made your strawberry pie.

535
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,720
这是他最喜欢的
It was his favorite.

536
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,290
可能你忘了  也是我最喜欢的
Maybe you forgot it was mine, too.

537
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,190
我没忘
I didn't forget.

538
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,740
悼词很棒
It was a nice speech.

539
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,010
谢谢你  哈维
Thank you, Harvey.

540
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,940
哈维
Harvey...

541
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,690
我父母去世的时候
when my parents died,

542
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,970
我觉得在这个世界上我是孤身一人了
I felt like I was completely alone in the world.

543
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,370
我不希望你也有这种感觉
I don't want you to feel that way.

544
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,950
我想让你知道  无论你的生活中
I want you to know that whether you want me

545
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,430
是否需要我的存在
in your life or not,

546
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,350
你仍然有一个爱你的妈妈
you still have a mother that loves you

547
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,550
一直都会在你身边
and will always be there for you.

548
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,430
我知道
I know that.

549
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,430
哈维  节哀顺变
Harvey, I'm-- I'm sorry for your loss.

550
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,410
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

551
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,870
-你把他带来了  -哈维
- You brought him here? - Harvey--

552
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,990
你居然敢把他带来
I said, you have the nerve to bring him here?

553
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,520
-他是我的伴侣  -这是你对每个
- He's my partner. - Is that what you call

554
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,120
你和父亲在一起时上过床的男人的称呼吗
every guy you slept with while you were with Dad?

555
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,510
别这么跟我说话  鲍比和我还在一起
Don't speak to me like that. Bobby and I are still together.

556
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,620
-你觉得我在乎吗  -你应该
- You think I give a shit? - You should...

557
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,370
因为这表明了我是什么样的人
because it shows what kind of man I am.

558
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,810
你就是个垃圾  你没有资格
You're a piece of shit. You have no right being here

559
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,580
在我父亲下葬的日子出现在这里
the day we put my father in the ground.

560
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,220
哈维  拜托  我们正要
Harvey, please. We were just about--

561
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,050
我不在乎我们要怎样
Yeah, I don't care what we were about to do.

562
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,030
你把他带来  就是对爸爸的侮辱
You spit in Dad's face by bringing him here.

563
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,020
没关系
I-it's okay.

564
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,040
莉莉  我要走了
Lily, I'll go.

565
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,540
我才不在乎你走不走
I don't care whether you stay or not.

566
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,520
不  我在乎  他要留下来
No, well, I do, and he is staying,

567
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,740
因为  你可能不愿听
because you may not want to hear this,

568
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,250
但是  你父亲很久前就接受他了
but your father accepted him a long time ago.

569
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,860
你知道吗  鲍比  你想取代我父亲
You know what? You want to take his place, Bobby,

570
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,760
随你便
why don't you go right ahead?

571
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,820
也许有天你会撞见她和别的男人在一起
Maybe one day you'll even walk in on her with another guy,

572
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,980
那时你就会知道我父亲的感受了
and you'll know exactly what my father felt.

573
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,160
唯一不同的是
The only difference will be

574
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,300
至少那个时候
at least then...

575
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,610
没人会要求我保密了
I won't be asked to keep the goddamn secret.

576
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,210
这里有什么好吃的
So, what's good here?

577
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,330
事实上  这里每一道菜都很好吃
Actually, everything's good here.

578
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,410
你常来这里吃
You eat here a lot?

579
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,210
当然
Of course I do.

580
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,150
这个
This...

581
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,640
这感觉有些奇怪是不是
This feels strange, doesn't it?

582
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,500
是的  有点
Yeah, a little bit.

583
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,450
我们从何说起呢
So, where do we start?

584
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,650
我想  就从我告诉你
I guess we start with me telling you

585
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,340
我已经准备好原谅你开始说起吧
that I'm ready to forgive you.

586
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,790
为什么是现在
Why now?

587
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,320
有个对我十分特别的人说服了我
Someone very special to me convinced me that I needed to.

588
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,510
不管她是谁
Whoever it is...

589
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,760
我很高兴她这么做
I'm glad she did.

590
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,250
很好
That's good.

591
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,970
我想让你知道
I want you to know...

592
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,460
我也原谅你了
that I forgive you, too.

593
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,970
原谅我  原谅我什么
Forgive me? For what?

594
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,260
原谅我最后一次见你时发生的事
For the last time I saw you

595
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,950
以及你消失了这么多年
and for you being gone all those years.

596
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,330
我消失是有原因的
I had my reasons to be gone.

597
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,370
是的  在你年轻的时候你有原因
Yes, you did, when you were younger,

598
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,870
但你不是个小孩子了
but you're not a child anymore,

599
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,790
你早就不是小孩子了
and you haven't been for a long time.

600
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,140
真是难以置信
I can't believe you.

601
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,410
你居然还倒打一耙
You're turning this around on me?

602
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,270
我没有倒打一耙  哈维
I'm not turning it around, Harvey.

603
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,610
你根本无法想象自己的孩子
You have no idea what it's like to have a child

604
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,900
假装自己不存在的感受
who acts like you don't even exist.

605
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,700
你也无法想象自己的母亲
You don't know what it's like to have a mother

606
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,470
要求自己替她向父亲说谎的感受
who asks you to lie to his own father for her.

607
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,130
哈维  我确实不该那么做
Harvey, I never should have done that,

608
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,720
这二十年来我都在努力告诉你
and I have been trying to tell you

609
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,240
为此我真的很抱歉
I am sorry about it for 20 years,

610
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,330
但昨天之前  你都让我清楚的感到
but until yesterday, you made it clear to me

611
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,310
你对我的死活根本毫不关心
that you had no interest in whether I lived or died.

612
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,130
-因为我的确不关心  -你无法理解
- Because I didn't. - Well, can't you understand

613
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,490
这会伤透一个人的心吗
how that could devastate a person?

614
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,200
我至少可以理解我们见面是个错误
I can understand how this was just a mistake,

615
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,950
因为你还是以前那个自私自利的
because you are the same selfish, self-centered,

616
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,410
不忠的女人
disloyal woman you always were.

617
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,200
你也还是以前那个
And you are the same self-absorbed, 

618
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,210
自以为是  小孩子脾气的人
childish man you always were.

619
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,880
那是谁的错
Well, whose fault is that?

620
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,620
又来了  你又要走了
Oh. There you go. Leave.

621
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,020
这是你的专长
That's what you do best.

622
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,110
你说什么
What'd you just say to me?

623
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,850
我说你也应该照照镜子  哈维
I said take a look in the mirror, Harvey,

624
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,670
或许过去我的确忽视了我的家庭
because I may have neglected my family in the past,

625
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,700
但你一直都在这么做  直到今天
but you've been doing it for as long as I can remember.

626
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,870
明天我该跟孩子们怎么说
So what am I supposed to tell the kids in the morning?

627
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,670
告诉他们我回纽约有急事
You tell them I've got business back in New York.

628
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,330
你要我为你说谎
You want me to lie for you?

629
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,510
马库斯  她居然好意思跟我说
God damn it, Marcus, she had the nerve to say 

630
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,820
我应该向她道歉
that I owed her an apology.

631
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,240
要是她来了  告诉她我没什么好说的了
If that's her, you tell her I've got nothing more to say.

632
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,200
我告诉你  哈维
You know what, Harvey?

633
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,240
要说你自己跟她说
You can tell her yourself,

634
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,280
因为我不想再夹在你们俩中间了
because I'm doing being in the middle of you two.

635
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,090
-鲍比  -他人呢
- Bobby. - Where is he?

636
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,610
-现在不合适  -你个混蛋
- Hey, now's not the time. - You son of a bitch.

637
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,400
你凭什么认为你可以这样闯进我们的生活
You think you can just walk into our lives

638
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,030
就这么揭开旧伤疤
and--and rip open old wounds?

639
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,270
你们的生活  你最好在我做出什么
Your lives? You better get the hell out of my face 

640
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,810
让你后悔的举动前赶紧走
before I do something that you'll regret.

641
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,170
你已经做了让我后悔的事
You already did something I regret

642
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,910
我就不该让你和你妈妈那样说话
by talking to your mother the way you did.

643
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,360
那个女人在背着我父亲和你睡在一起时
That woman gave up the right to be called my mother

644
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,680
就放弃了当我母亲的权利
when she got together with you behind my father's back.

645
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,000
也许你不把她当母亲了
Well, maybe you don't consider her to be your mother,

646
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,980
但她是我妻子
but she's my wife, 

647
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,930
如果别人那样对她说话
and if anyone else spoke to her the way you did,

648
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,230
我早放倒他们了
they'd be on the floor right now.

649
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,320
你想跟我动手
You want to take a swing at me?

650
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,510
-哈维  哈维  -别  还别拦我
- Harvey, Harvey-- - No, no, no.

651
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,790
让他好好发泄一下
Let him get it out of his system,

652
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,880
因为我自己也很想发泄
'cause I know I want to get it out of mine.

653
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,180
我不是来打架的  哈维
I didn't come here to fight, Harvey.

654
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,620
我来是告诉你
I came here to tell you

655
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,540
我从来没见过你妈妈
I've never seen your mother more excited

656
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,610
像今晚出门见你时那么激动过
than when she was heading out to have dinner with you.

657
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,140
她终于要和她的儿子和好了
She was finally gonna get to reconnect with her son.

658
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,260
你却彻底毁了她的好心情
And then you pulled the rug out from underneath her.

659
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,960
是你夺走了她的喜悦
You took that excitement away.

660
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,180
所以这次你走了  就别再回来了
So, when you leave this time, just stay gone,

661
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,420
因为事实是
because the truth is,

662
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,200
这个家没有你过得更好
this family works better without you.

663
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,120
瑞秋  我需要你帮忙
Rachel, I need you to help me with something,

664
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,480
-而且很急  -什么事
- and I need it quickly. - What is it?

665
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,110
泰迪・道尔需要
Teddy Doyle needs to access

666
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,550
查看他为了避税
the proceeds from the sale of his company

667
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,670
放入信托的交易收入
that were put in trust to avoid taxes,

668
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,890
还不能因此触发税务检查
and he needs to do it without triggering those taxes.

669
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,270
路易  你开玩笑吗  我们不在迪拜
Louis, are you kidding? This isn't Dubai.

670
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,420
他的要求根本不可能
He's not gonna be able to do that.

671
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,530
我知道  但无论如何都要做到
I know that, but I need him to be able to anyway.

672
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,910
把文件给我
Give me the file.

673
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,730
-我会想出办法的  -谢谢
- I'll figure something out. - Thanks.

674
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,260
我为你骄傲  路易
I'm proud of you, Louis.

675
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,080
-为什么  -泰迪・道尔是哈维的客户
- For what? - Teddy Doyle is Harvey's client.

676
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,770
我听说了你们的事
And I heard about your thing.

677
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,120
所以  这意味着你原谅他了
So this must mean that you forgave him.

678
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,220
是的
I did.

679
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,050
想到办法马上告诉我
Bring that to me as soon as you have something.

680
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,910
迈克  哈伯曼的案子我有个问题
Hey, Mike, I got a question about the Haberman case.

681
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,550
他丢了工作  他们要收回他的车
He lost his job. They're taking his car.

682
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,670
-我在想办法  -你需要重申协议
- I'm trying-- - You need a reaffirmation agreement.

683
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,920
-待会儿再说好吗  -好
- Can I help you in a minute? - Yeah.

684
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:27,790
好
Great.

685
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,460
各位  能听我说两句吗
Hey, everyone, can you listen up for a sec?

686
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:36,900
玛莉莎
Marissa...

687
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,940
不会太久
this won't take long.

688
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,510
纳森向大家介绍我时
When Nathan introduced me, 

689
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,020
说我曾在皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所工作
he told you that I used to work at Pearson Specter Litt.

690
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,990
但他没告诉你们  我为什么不在那儿工作了
What he didn't tell you is why I don't work there anymore.

691
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,350
而其中的原因
And the reason isn't

692
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,800
不是我没法回去当公司律师
that I couldn't hack it as a corporate lawyer.

693
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,620
而是我根本就不是律师
It's because I wasn't a lawyer at all.

694
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,290
大家看一下
Here, read that.

695
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,810
这是我的故事
That is my story.

696
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,180
我做的事情
That's what I did.

697
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,450
文章里的每一字都属实
Every word of these articles is true.

698
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,740
我根本就不应该去皮尔逊-斯佩克特
I never should have been at Pearson Specter.

699
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,700
但没有律师资格  并不是
But not being a lawyer isn't the only reason

700
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,040
我不该去那儿的唯一原因
I didn't belong there.

701
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,980
我之所以
You see, the whole reason

702
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,010
想成为一个律师
that I wanted to be a lawyer in the first place

703
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,340
就是为了帮助每一天
was so that I could help the kind of people

704
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,640
来到这家诊所的人们
that come into this clinic every single day.

705
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,320
我以为你们都知道我的事
Now, I thought you all knew this,

706
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,580
但我发现原来你们不知道
but it's clear to me now that you don't.

707
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,600
纳森是想要保护我
Nathan wanted to protect me,

708
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,360
但是
but...

709
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,280
我宁愿用事实换来你们的尊重
I'd rather have you respect me.

710
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,340
如果哪位还有问题
If any of you have any questions at all,

711
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,060
可以来找我谈
please come talk to me about it.

712
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,860
如果没有  大家就赶紧回去工作
If not, let's get back to work.

713
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,360
迈克
Mike.

714
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,640
你不必这么做
You didn't have to do that.

715
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,180
我应该
Yeah, I did.

716
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,130
你还没走
You're still here.

717
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,570
我的航班还有两小时才起飞
My flight isn't for another two hours.

718
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,570
我可没打算被那个混蛋轰走
I wasn't gonna let that asshole drive me away.

719
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,070
哈维  昨晚鲍比说的话
Listen, Harvey, about what Bobby said last night--

720
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,870
你不必为他找借口  马库斯
You don't need to make excuses for him, Marcus.

721
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,420
我不是在找借口
Oh, I'm not making excuses.

722
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,020
我只是告诉你
I'm telling you he had every right

723
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,320
他有资格那么说
to say what he said to you.

724
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,170
难以置信  你现在支持他了
I don't believe this. You're on his side now?

725
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,980
我支持的是我的家庭
The only side I'm on is my family's--

726
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,600
那个你一直都不参与的家庭
the family that you've never been a part of.

727
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,840
马库斯  别这样
Marcus, come on. 

728
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,200
你知道告诉一个五岁的孩子 
Do you know what it's like to tell a five-year-old 

729
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,790
为什么奶奶和哈维伯父
why Grandma and Uncle Harvey 

730
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,390
无法共处一室的感觉吗
can't be in the same room together?

731
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,590
因为你让我处于的就是这种境地
Because that's the position you put me in 

732
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,220
年复一年
year after year.

733
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,680
这里有完满的生活
There's a whole life going on here

734
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,340
而你并不是其中一份子
that you're not even a part of.

735
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,220
你以为我不知道自己错过了什么
You think I don't know what I've missed?

736
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,610
我说的不只是生日  哈维
I'm not just talking about birthdays, Harvey.

737
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,640
我几年前旧病复发
I got sick again, couple years ago.

738
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,750
什么
What?

739
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,220
-你为什么不告诉我  -我为什么要告诉你
- Why didn't you tell me? - Why would I?

740
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,650
要我生病的同时面对你们的争吵吗
So that we could have this at the same time?

741
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,440
-马库斯  -停  听我说
- Marcus-- - No, listen to me.

742
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,230
你知道凯蒂带我去化疗时  是谁在帮忙吗
You know who helped out when Katie was taking me to chemo?

743
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,430
是妈妈每晚做饭
Mom made dinner every night.

744
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,630
是鲍比每天送孩子们上学
Bobby took my kids to school every day,

745
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,920
也就是说
which means...

746
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,070
虽然对你来说他们很可恶  但对孩子来说
while they might be monsters to you, to my kids, 

747
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,200
他们就是爷爷和奶奶
they're Grandma and Grandpa.

748
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,590
你可能不愿意他们把鲍比当爷爷
And you might not like that shit coming from Bobby,

749
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,250
但事实如此  哈维
but it's the truth, Harvey...

750
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,930
无论你想不想听
whether you want to hear it or not.

751
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,140
有空吗
Do you have a minute?

752
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,470
当然
Of course.

753
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,130
很抱歉我误解了你
I'm sorry that I misjudged you.

754
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,900
没事
It's okay.

755
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,330
就像我说的  我们是一个队伍的
Like I said, we're on the same team.

756
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,480
确实  我也不该承诺索菲亚
We are, and I also should not have promised Sofia

757
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,620
我们一定赢
that we would win.

758
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,450
但我要说我会一直想办法
But I told you that I wouldn't stop looking for a way 

759
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,400
帮她保住住处
to keep her in her home,

760
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,960
而且我也找到了
and I think I found one.

761
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,310
玛莉莎  无论你
Marissa, it doesn't matter 

762
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,660
找到什么法律根据
what kind of legal basis you've got.

763
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,440
如果她不能及时付房租
If she can't pay her rent in the meantime--

764
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,550
这正是我要说的  特洛伊诉萨福克案
That's what I'm talking about--Troy v. Suffolk.

765
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,710
只要我们能证明她曾试图跟房东说过
As long as we can prove that she tried to tell the landlord

766
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,690
-供暖问题  -是的  但我们没法证明
- about the heat-- - Yeah, but we can't prove it.

767
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,960
她没有写下来
She doesn't have it in writing.

768
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,750
如果有电话记录就能证明
We can if we use the phone records.

769
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,540
通话记录不能作为证据
Phone records aren't proof of a complaint.

770
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,040
是不能  但如果一个人连续两个月
No, but the only people who call their landlord

771
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,620
每周都给房东打三次电话
three times a week for two months

772
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,690
那这个人一定是有东西要修理
are people who have a problem that needs fixing.

773
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,780
然后我们就可以拿出旅馆收据
Then we enter the motel receipts

774
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,310
和购买取暖器的收据
and the receipts for the space heaters

775
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,060
来抵付要交的租金
as substitution for rent paid.

776
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,750
他不仅无法驱逐她
And not only can he not evict her,

777
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,300
还不能收她的房租
she doesn't have to pay back rent.

778
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,710
我们只要说服法庭
We just need to convince the court

779
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,250
接受通话记录就可以了
to accept these phone records.

780
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,860
问题是我们不能说服法庭做任何事
The problem is we can't convince the court of anything.

781
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,080
我还不是律师
I'm not a lawyer yet,

782
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,350
我本来希望你能  但是
and I was hoping you could do it, but then...

783
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,300
没关系
It's okay.

784
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,140
我能找到这样的人
I've got just the person.

785
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,950
哈维
Harvey.

786
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,800
我能进来吗
Can I come in?

787
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,200
那要看你为什么来
Depends on why you're here.

788
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,680
我来为我昨晚的表现道歉
I'm here to apologize for the way I acted last night.

789
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,850
因为鲍比找过你了
Is this 'cause Bobby came to see you?

790
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,430
不是  因为马库斯生病了
No, it's because Marcus got sick,

791
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,690
是你一直在照顾他  他从没跟我说过
and you took care of him, and he couldn't even tell me that.

792
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,260
-哈维  -我很生气
- Harvey-- - I'm so angry.

793
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,040
我不想再生气了
I don't want to be angry anymore,

794
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,380
但我不知怎么样停下来
but I don't know how to stop.

795
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,870
那我要说我非常抱歉
Then let me say how sorry I am

796
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,170
给你带来这么多伤痛
for all the pain that I have caused you.

797
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,000
你不必跟我说你有多抱歉
You don't need to tell me how sorry you are.

798
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,670
但是我要说
Yes, I do.

799
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:24,490
哈维  过去二十年来的事
Harvey, we both may have played a part

800
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,070
我们都有责任
in the last 20 years,

801
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,670
但我是一个成年人
but I was an adult,

802
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,380
把你置于那种境地
and I put you in that position.

803
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,700
过去的每一天
And not a day goes by

804
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,630
我都清楚你为何恨我
that I don't understand why you hate me.

805
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,290
我是你的母亲
I was your mother.

806
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,780
我本该保护你
I was supposed to protect you...

807
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,470
而不是伤害你
not scar you.

808
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,510
哈维
Harvey...

809
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,130
我真的很抱歉
I am so sorry.

810
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,860
我不恨你  妈妈
I don't hate you, Mom.

811
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,000
我恨你做过的事  可能永远都恨
I hate what you did, and I probably always will,

812
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,070
但我不恨你
but I don't hate you.

813
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,340
这我能接受
I'll take that.

814
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,860
怎么了
What is it?

815
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,100
没什么  只是
It's nothing. It's...

816
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,550
只是  我在墙上挂了你的画
it's just, I had your painting on my wall

817
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,680
挂了这么久  我刚刚意识到
for the longest time, and I just realized...

818
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,400
我有多怀念它
how much I missed it.

819
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,500
我爱你  哈维
I love you, Harvey.

820
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,570
我也爱你  妈妈
I love you, too, Mom.

821
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:44,730
法官大人
Your Honor, 

822
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,170
我的当事人是带着两个孩子的单身妈妈
my client is a single mother with two small children.

823
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,320
我的狗还是拉布拉多猎犬呢
And my dog is a Labrador retriever.

824
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,140
唯一相关的事实是
But the only thing that's relevant here

825
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,550
他的当事人欠了三个月房租
is that his client hasn't paid her rent in three months.

826
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,140
但她不付房租的原因则是
And the reason she hasn't paid it is because 

827
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,000
整个冬天
she's had no heat

828
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,530
房子都没暖气  还有扇窗户坏了
and a broken window all winter,

829
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,400
虽然她已经反复要求修理了
despite repeated requests for repairs.

830
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,100
但这些要求没有形成任何文件记录
There's absolutely no documentation of any such request. 

831
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,820
这不是真的  我当事人在两个月间
That's not true. My client called her landlord

832
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,850
给房东打了20次电话
20 times over the course of two months,

833
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,500
这可以从她的通话记录中看出
as you can see from her phone records.

834
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,790
那不能证明任何问题
That's not proof of anything.

835
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,100
那证明你的当事人跟我的当事人有过通话
It's proof your client spoke to mine

836
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,920
每次大概两分钟
for an average of two minutes per call,

837
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,920
当然不会是谈论天气
and it wasn't to talk about the weather.

838
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,720
法官大人  格雷迪先生
Your Honor, Mr. Grady gave me

839
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
在20分钟前才给我这些没意义的证据
a copy of this nonsense 20 minutes ago,

840
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,350
他还专门承认这些与本案不相关
and he specifically agreed it wasn't relevant.

841
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,680
她在说谎
That--that is a lie.

842
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
是吗  因为我有一条通话记录
Really? Because I have a phone record

843
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,680
是10分钟前我打给你的
of a two-minute call that I made to you

844
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,160
时常大概两分钟
ten minutes ago.

845
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,470
你可能是打给我了  但我们没谈那个
You may have called me, but we didn't talk about that.

846
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,380
是的  我打电话给你
That's right. Just because I called you

847
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,010
并不能说明我们谈了什么
doesn't mean I can prove what we talked about.

848
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,450
法官大人  她打了20次
Your Honor, she called 20 times.

849
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,160
对  或许是要解释她迟交房租的原因呢
Yeah, probably to say why her rent was late,

850
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,840
因为她从未支付
because she never paid it.

851
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,060
但我们无法知道
But we won't know that

852
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,750
因为她的要求从未写在纸面上
because we don't have it in writing,

853
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,050
而法庭要求的  就是纸面记录
which is what the court requires.

854
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,970
法官大人  我需要...
Your Honor, I need...

855
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,870
我请求一点时间与我上司协商
I'd like to request time to confer with my supervisor.

856
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,430
上司  他可是个律师
His supervisor? He's a lawyer.

857
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,810
-你得帮他  -我做不到
- You have to help him. - I can't.

858
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,570
我...需要一点时间整理思路
I just need a minute to--to gather my thoughts.

859
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,320
这算什么  学前教育圈吗
What is this, preschool circle time?

860
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,680
法官大人  那位女士没有支付房租
Your Honor, the woman didn't pay her rent.

861
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,880
现在到了支付期限
The deadline is now.

862
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,040
我们申请  如果明早十点没有收到支票
We are requesting permission to evict

863
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,590
则法庭允许将其驱逐
if we don't have a check by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

864
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,680
-法官大人  拜托  -她会失去她的家
- Your Honor, please. - She's gonna lose her home.

865
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,880
时间到了  律师  批准申请
Time's up, counselor. Permission granted.

866
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,290
哈维  你在这里做什么
Harvey, what are you doing here?

867
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,940
什么时候回来的
When did you get back?

868
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,300
十分钟前
Ten minutes ago.

869
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,730
怎么样
How'd it go?

870
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,810
很顺利
It went well.

871
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,630
我很高兴
I'm glad.

872
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,730
其实  我需要你帮点忙
As a matter of fact, I need your help with something.

873
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,770
什么事都可以
Anything.

874
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,660
但你得先去做一件事情
But there's something you have to do first.

875
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,810
-罗斯先生  -普莱斯小姐
- Mr. Ross. - Miss Price.

876
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,730
我有话想跟你说  你有时间吗
I wanted to talk to you. Do you have a minute?

877
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,720
不太有
Not really.

878
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,900
他们明天就来了  我在打包  还有...
They're coming tomorrow. I've been packing, and--

879
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,870
他们不会来的
They're not coming.

880
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,340
三千六百美金
$3,600?

881
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,510
应该够支付你
Should be enough to cover your rent 

882
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,680
近三个月的房租了
for the last three months.

883
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,710
-我不明白  -法律诊所有基金
- I don't understand. - The clinic has a fund

884
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,170
帮人度过这种情况
to help with this kind of thing.

885
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,380
我们一直都在这么做
We do it all the time.

886
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,210
但这是你个人签的
But this is from you.

887
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,580
从我账户支付能快一点
It's just quicker to do it from my account--

888
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,920
你明白的  手续里繁文缛节太多
you know, red tape and all that.

889
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,540
-我不知道说什么了  -说你明早第一件事
- I don't know what to say. - Say you'll take that

890
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,180
就是把它拿给你的房东
to your landlord first thing in the morning.

891
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,890
如果他们除了给你写收据还做了什么事情
And if they do anything but give you a written receipt,

892
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,960
第一时间打给我
you call me right away.

893
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,050
我会的  谢谢你
I will. Thank you.

894
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,620
-你回来了  -是的
- You're back. - I am.

895
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,990
我听说你替我打理了我的客户

896
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,170
谢谢  路易
Thanks, Louis.

897
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,550
不客气  我们是合作伙伴
You're welcome, but we're partners,

898
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,070
他们都是我们共同的客户
and they're all our clients.

899
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,680
是的
They are.

900
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,330
路易  我说你没有准备好做管理合伙人
Louis, I didn't mean it when I said

901
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,170
那不是真心的
you weren't ready to be managing partner.

902
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,560
不  你是真心的
Yes, you did.

903
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,430
或许是  但事实是
Maybe I did, but the truth is,

904
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,030
我也没准备好
I'm not ready either.

905
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,500
我们一起做临时管理合伙人怎么样
What do you say we both act as interim managing partners?

906
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,380
我很荣幸
I'd be honored.

907
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,380
在我看来  我们要做的第一件事是
It seems to me, the first order of business is,

908
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,220
律所名称怎么办
what are we gonna do about the name of the firm?

909
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,960
我不知道你怎么想的
I don't know about you, but...

910
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,790
但我觉得我们还是不改了
I think we should keep it exactly the same.

911
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,170
我也这么想
Me too.

912
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:34,840
谁都不知道
I mean, you never know 

913
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,440
她什么时候会想回来  对吧
when she's gonna want to come back, right?

914
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,730
没错  谁都不知道
No, Louis. You never know.

915
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,120
你俩还在这儿干什么呢
What are you two still doing here?

916
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,250
我们还有十二小时
We've still got 12 hours.

917
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,310
我们不会停止
We're not going to stop 

918
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,820
帮助索菲亚保住公寓的
trying to keep Sofia in her apartment.

919
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,100
好样的
Good for you.

920
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,380
但你们不必今晚做了
But you don't have to do it tonight.

921
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,010
她获得了一点宽限的时间
Turns out she got a little grace period.

922
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,310
怎么会
How did she get that?

923
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,120
当你在乎你的当事人时
It's amazing what you can do

924
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,560
你做的事情会出乎意料
when you care about your clients.

925
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,970
那我猜我们明早第一件事
Then I guess first thing tomorrow,

926
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,200
就是做下一步的规划
we should plan our next move.

927
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,480
我想是的
I guess we should.
