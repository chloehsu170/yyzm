But my dad isn't gonna be the only one who doesn't like it.

35
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,640
-为什么  -因为这涉及到通过我
- Why not? - Because it involves impugning his integrity

36
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,870
质疑他的人品
and doing it through me.

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,920
我在周六前都不会返回康涅狄格州

00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,180

你马上打给利普希茨
I need to call Lipschitz right now 

72
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,750
告诉他我今天不能去了  我病了
and tell him I can't make it today, I'm sick.

73
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,030
什么意思  你病了
What do you mean, you're sick?

74
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,310
我病得要死了
I mean I'm deathly ill.

75
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,230
不管他说什么  我都去不了
I can't make it in there no matter what he says.

76
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,150
路易  我无意插手你的事
Louis, I don't mean to get up in your business,

77
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,470
但你去跟那人谈话
but the time you spend with that man

78
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,150
是你这一周中最重要的事
is the most important part of your week.

79
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,110
但我真正的意思是  对我最重要
And by your week, I mean my week.

80
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,010
好吧  我不管是对谁
Okay, I don't care whose week it is,

81
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,910
我今天不能见他  我太忙了
I can't see him today. I'm too busy.

82
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,620
忙  你不是病了吗
Busy. I thought you were sick.

83
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,320
是啊  我又病又忙
I am. Sick and busy. 

84
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,200
而且我有一桌的东西要做
And I have a desk full of things I need to get to, 

85
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,220
尤其这个
especially this.

86
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,880
你都不知道那是什么
You don't even know what that is.

87
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,660
你好大胆  我很清楚
How dare you. I know what's going on

88
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,740
我桌上每件案子的情况
with every case on my desk.

89
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,700
我只知道这件案子需要我去办
And what I know is this case needs my help.

90
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,170
去打给利普希茨  然后别打扰我
Now, call Lipschitz and leave me to my business 

91
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,110
还有
and one more thing:

92
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,530
《权力的游戏》永远不许再上我的待办事项
take "Game of Thrones" off my to-do list for the rest of its run.

93
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,740
布莱恩  我相信不管这是什么案子
Brian, I'm sure you're doing just fine

94
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,180
你都能做的很好
on whatever the hell this case is.

95
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,780
但我就想来问问
But I just thought I'd check in

96
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,900
不管格蕾琴为什么问了起来
and for whatever reason Gretchen happens to ask,

97
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,290
你就这么告诉她
you tell her that's exactly what I did.

98
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,390
好吗  聊天愉快
Okay? Good talk.

99
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,330
其实  是有点问题
Actually, there's a problem with it.

100
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,280
我真的需要你帮忙
And I could really use your help.

101
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,940
-什么问题  -是我们的奶嘴[奶子]
- What's the problem? - It's our nipples.

102
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,440
几乎是完全一样的
They're almost exactly the same.

103
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,380
-什么  -客户  完美宝贝
- Our what now? - Our client, Perfect Baby.

104
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,760
哦  那个奶嘴啊
Yes, those kind of nipples.

105
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,580
不是我今早才...
Not the nipples that I was just this morning--

106
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,600
没事了  你说什么
Never mind. Uh, what were you saying?

107
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,370
我们的奶嘴
There's an overlap between our pacifier

108
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,640
和可爱宝贝要推出的奶嘴有重叠
and the pacifier Sweetie Pie Baby's about to take to market.

109
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,310
我通知了他们  但他们一直在搪塞我
I notified them, but they're giving me the runaround.

110
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,320
所以我想或许如果你打去...
So I thought maybe if you called--

111
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,790
等等  什么意思  搪塞你
Wait, whoa, whoa. What do you mean runaround?

112
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,570
我一直想安排一次会面
I've been trying to set a meeting

113
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,610
都近俩月了  但他们一直拖延
for almost two months, but they keep pushing.

114
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,520
该死的  我们得马上过去
Son of a bitch! We need to get over there right away.

115
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,240
什么  为什么
What? Why? 

116
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,990
因为如果我们通知他们有重叠
Because if we notify them of overlap,

117
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,560
但又不在六十天内采取后续行动
but don't follow up within 60 days,

118
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,620
我们将失去起诉他们专利侵权的权利
we lose the right to sue them for patent infringement.

119
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,740
-天啊  -是啊
- Oh, my God. - Exactly. 

120
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,820
我们赶紧去告诉那些混蛋
Now let's go tell these assholes 

121
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,790
要是他们以为能轻松地剽窃我们的奶嘴
if they think they're gonna rip our nipples off without a fight,

122
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,210
他们就错了
they got another thing coming.

123
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,680
你来干什么  迈克
What are you doing in here, Mike?

124
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,040
我都好几周没机会享受我的早间拿铁了
I haven't had a chance to enjoy my morning latte in weeks.

125
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,560
你见到今早的《周刊》了吗
You seen this morning's "Journal"?

126
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,400
新任副检察长
There's a new Deputy AG.

127
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,500
连赢了15桩案子了
He's won 15 cases in a row.

128
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,780
他立志要整治华尔街
He's making it his mission to clean up Wall Street.

129
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,020
这跟我们有什么关系
What does that have to do with us?

130
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,390
你要去对付他
You're gonna take him on.

131
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,420
什么
Excuse me?

132
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,910
你要跟他打一架
You're gonna pick a fight with this guy,

133
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,400
打破他的不败纪录
and you're gonna clean his clock.

134
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,180
迈克  我感谢你对我能力的信心
Mike, I appreciate your confidence in my ability,

135
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,620
但是  究竟是怎么回事
but... what exactly is going on here?

136
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,660
哈维  我回来时
Harvey, when I got back here,

137
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,240
你立志要向世人证明你不是杰西卡
you set out to show the world that you're not Jessica.

138
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,380
转眼间  我就让你处于防守状态
And three seconds later, I put you on the defensive,

139
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,610
到现在也没有摆脱
and you've been there ever since.

140
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,490
-迈克...  -听我说
- Mike-- - Just listen to me.

141
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,460
乔丹虽然是史上最棒的防守球员
Jordan might've been one of the best defensive players of all time, 

142
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,390
但人们并不是因为这个才记住了他
but that's not what people remember him for.

143
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,450
你是说  该我自己控球了
So you're telling me it's time to put the ball in my hands.

144
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,500
我是说  你去挑战这个大能人
I'm telling you that you take on this hotshot,

145
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,700
就能让世界知道  你想对付谁都行
you show the world that you can take on anyone.

146
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,000
这是个好点子  迈克
That's a great idea, Mike,

147
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,030
只是  他并没有找我们任何客户的麻烦
but the only problem is, he's not coming after any of our clients, 

148
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,650
我希望你不是建议我们送一个给他当目标
and I hope you're not suggesting we put one of them on his radar.

149
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,250
我是说我们去签一个本就是他目标的客户
I'm saying we sign a client that's already on his radar.

150
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,980
你怎么不早说呢
Why the hell didn't you say that in the first place?

151
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,780
我不需要说  我已经签了
I didn't need to, 'cause I already signed them.

152
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,530
那我们去会会那个混蛋
Then I guess we pay this jerkoff a visit

153
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,790
告诉他  他的不败纪录要破了
and let him know his winning streak just came to an end.

154
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,830
我本打算在这种地方买会员的
You know, I was thinking about joining a place like this.

155
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,460
但是
The truth is,

156
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,800
我从来讨厌一群废柴在一个封闭空间里
I've never been a fan of losers sweating together 

157
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,250
一起流汗
in a confined space.

158
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,620
除非是在法庭上  而且是你让他们流汗
Unless it's in a courtroom and you're the one making them sweat.

159
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,800
看来我名声远播
I see my reputation precedes me.

160
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,070
我现在清楚你的名声了  斯佩克特
Well, I'm aware of your reputation now, Specter.

161
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,690
不如你赶紧说你此行的目的吧
So why don't you tell me what the hell you're doing here?

162
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,960
那你应该也知道我不喜欢浪费时间
Then you're also aware that I don't like to waste my time

163
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,210
或者我客户的钱
or my client's money.

164
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,910
所以不如你马上放弃
So why don't you drop your bullshit case

165
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,740
对埃尔蒙特投资的扯淡诉讼
against Elmont Investments right now?

166
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,640
你什么时候开始代理埃尔蒙特投资了
Since when are you representing elmont Investments?

167
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,410
他们发现某人为了给自己贴金要坑他们
Since they realized they were being railroaded by a showboater 

168
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,660
所以想找个真正的律师叫那人知道厉害
and that they needed a real lawyer to put him in his place.

169
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,740
-是吗  -是的
- Is that a fact? - Yes, it is.

170
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,800
在我看来你还得带上你的小跟班
Well, it looks to me you had to bring your little buddy here 

171
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,850
就是因为怕得不敢一个人来见我
because you're too scared to go up against me by yourself.

172
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,620
他不怕任何人的
Yeah, he's not really scared of anyone.

173
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,630
而且告诉你  10分钟前
And for your information, until about 10 minutes ago,

174
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,270
他还不知道你是谁
he had no idea who you were.

175
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,560
扯淡  他很清楚我是谁
Bullshit. He knows exactly who I am.

176
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,650
我们在同一个办公室干了三年
We worked in the same damn office for three years

177
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,510
什么
What?

178
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,920
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

179
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,180
你真不记得我了  是吗
You really don't remember me, do you?

180
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,970
不记得
No, I don't.

181
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,860
那我提醒你一下
Well let me ring a bell for you.

182
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,970
我叫安德鲁・马利克
My name is Andrew Malik.

183
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,100
你去讨好卡梅隆・丹尼斯
And while you were kissing Cameron Dennis's ass

184
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,480
处理大案时  我在隔了三个门的办公室里
working on high profile cases, I was three doors down,

185
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,560
干到凌晨两点
working till two in the morning

186
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,260
把真正的罪犯送入监狱
putting the real criminals away.

187
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,050
你当时可能没记住我
And you may not have remembered me then,

188
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,820
但你这次绝对会记住我的
but you're sure as hell going to remember me now.

189
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,980
{\an8}十二年前

190
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,300
你在这里干什么
What are you doing in here?

191
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,190
没什么  哈维让我把这个放卡梅隆桌上
Nothing. Harvey asked me to put this on Cameron's desk.

192
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,040
当然了
Of course he did.

193
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,980
卡梅隆和哈维简直和父子一样
Cameron and Harvey are like father and son.

194
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,340
而你和哈维就像是...
And you and Harvey are like--

195
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,470
你懂的
Well, you know what. 

196
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,040
说实话我还真不懂  你说说看
No, I don't, actually. Why don't you tell me? 

197
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,790
当我没说
Forget it.

198
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,280
我不打算当你没说  安德
I'm not gonna forget it, Andy.

199
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,450
你不能随随便便做这种错误的指控
And I'm not gonna let you make a false accusation like that 

200
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,310
然后一走了之
and get away with it.

201
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,650
那这个指控也是错误的吗
How about this accusation?

202
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,810
现在已经八点多了  我还在这里工作
It's past eight, and I'm still here working.

203
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,670
但卡梅隆不会知道
Cameron will never see that 

204
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,390
因为他八成和你老板出去喝酒了
because he's probably out getting a drink with your boss.

205
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,460
那也许你该意识到
Well then maybe you should realize

206
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,830
努力工作并不是生命中的唯一
that working hard isn't the only thing that matters in life.

207
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,230
不  真正重要的是一个人得关心自己的工作
No, what should matter is that you care about what you do.

208
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,820
卡梅隆爱哈维
And Cameron loves Harvey.

209
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,970
所以他看不清摆在他面前的事实
So he can't see the truth that's in front of his face.

210
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,220
什么事实
And what truth is that?

211
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,140
哈维・斯佩克特不会一直留在这里
That there is no way that Harvey Specter will be here forever.

212
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,950
但我会
Well, I'll be here forever.

213
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,630
而我不在乎他俩的关系有多密切
And I don't care how tight they are

214
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,300
也不在乎你俩的关系有多密切
or how tight the two of you are.

215
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,490
我在检察官这个职位上会比你们干的都久
I will outlast you all as a prosecutor.

216
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,070
你在这儿呢
There you are.

217
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,420
我到处找你
I was looking all over for you.

218
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,450
怎么了
What for?

219
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,070
我知道你不想多谈你昨晚的约会
Well I know you were being a little secretive about your date last night.

220
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,610
但我关心你
But I care about you

221
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,120
我想知道情况如何
and I wanted to know how it went.

222
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,560
没情况
It didn't.

223
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,860
-你不是说...  -我知道我说了什么
- But you said-- - I know what I said.

224
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,040
我想自我感觉良好一晚
I wanted a night to just feel good about myself.

225
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,790
但我意识到昨晚不是时候
But I realized that last night wasn't gonna do that.

226
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,080
所以我取消了
So I called it off.

227
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,940
我很遗憾
Sorry.

228
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,940
你想谈谈吗
You wanna talk about it?

229
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,080
不  瑞秋  我不想
No, Rachel. I don't.

230
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,950
抱歉  你们是不是走错办公室了
I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong office.

231
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,120
我们没走错
Oh, we're in the right office.

232
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,950
实际上  我们三周前就应该见面的
In fact, we were supposed to meet three weeks ago, 

233
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,190
但你要求另约时间  结果一直没约
but you asked to reschedule and never did.

234
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,840
你是皮尔逊-斯佩克特律所的人
You're from Pearson Specter.

235
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,190
皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特
Pearson Specter Litt.

236
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,180
布莱恩和我说
And according to Brian,

237
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,130
他一直试图约你见面  但都没成功
he's been trying to meet with you for quite some time.

238
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,760
对  我们一直挺忙的  所以...
Yes, we've been a bit busy, so--

239
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,800
可不是嘛  忙着抢我们客户的钱
Yeah, busy trying to douche our client out of their money.

240
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,310
你要以为我们会放任你们的盗版奶嘴流入市场
And if you think we're letting you go to market with your rip-off nipple,

241
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,250
那你简直比那些买你的破尿布的婴儿还傻
you're even dumber than the babies that buy your crappy diapers.

242
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,920
我们不会把我们的新产品撤下市场的
We're not shelving our new product.

243
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,060
那样的话  我们会起诉你们
In that case, we'll take you to court,

244
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,530
你的产品最终还是会被撤下
and it'll end up being shelved anyway.

245
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,230
或者你们可以承认侵犯了我们的设计
Or you can admit you infringed on our design

246
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,830
然后给我们你们收益的60%
and cut us in for 60%.

247
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,920
我们什么都没有侵犯
We didn't infringe on anything

248
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,860
假如你觉得我们侵犯了
and if you think we did

249
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,690
那你完全不了解你所代理的市场
then you don't know a thing about the market you represent.

250
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,880
不了解市场
Not know the market?

251
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,050
告诉你  我家刚添了宝宝
For your information, I've got a newborn.

252
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,790
要不是有我们的奶嘴
And if it weren't for our pacifiers,

253
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,130
我上个月基本上就不用睡了
I wouldn't have gotten what little sleep I have in the last month. 

254
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,970
那我猜你当父亲比你当律师更不称职
Then I guess you're an even shittier father than you are a lawyer

255
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,680
因为假如不用奶嘴你就不能哄宝宝入睡
because if you can't put a baby down without a pacifier,

256
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,130
那你在庭上完全没胜算
then you don't have a chance in hell against us in court.

257
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,930
你说什么
What did you just say?

258
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,800
我说无论是作为父亲还是作为律师
I said you don't know what you're doing

259
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,450
你都不知道自己在做什么
as a father or a lawyer.

260
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,640
你怎么敢这么说  我不管你怎么想的
How dare you. I don't give a shit what you think.

261
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,740
我们不要那60%
We're not taking 60%.

262
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,380
我们要把你们告个底朝天
We're gonna sue your ass into the ground.

263
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,670
等下我一回到办公室
And as soon as I get back to my office,

264
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,960
我就要申请限制令
I'm filing a restraining order

265
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,020
永远地阻止你那假货流入市场
to stop you from ever taking your fraudulent product to market,

266
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,660
你个大骗子
you lying sack of shit.

267
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,540
好了  说说你在想什么吧
All right, why don't you say what's on your mind?

268
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,910
谁说我在想事情了
Who says there's anything on my mind?

269
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,590
你永远都在想事情
There's always something on your mind.

270
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,310
只有在你不确定自己应不应该说的时候
The only time it doesn't pop right out of your mouth

271
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,850
你才会闭嘴不谈你的想法
is when you're not sure you should say it.

272
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,200
听着  我刚刚就是在想
Look, I was just thinking 

273
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,400
假如我早知道你和这家伙有过节
if I'd known there was a personal history with this guy,

274
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,730
我就不会选这个案子了
I wouldn't have picked this case.

275
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,090
是啊  假如我早知道我和这个家伙有过节
Yeah, if I'd known there was a personal history with this guy,

276
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,090
就不用等你替我选了
you wouldn't have had to.

277
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,340
哈维  听我说
Harvey, listen to me.

278
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,670
我接了监狱那个案子  差点让我们关门
I took on the prison case and it almost ripped us apart.

279
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,280
我接这个案子就是为了弥补
I took on this to make up for that.

280
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,580
我可不希望这个案子和监狱那个一样
I don't want it to do the same thing.

281
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,600
你为什么会觉得自己知道这个案子的后果
What makes you think you know what this case is gonna do?

282
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,880
我并不知道这个案子会造成什么后果
I don't know exactly what it's gonna do.

283
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,440
但我知道这案子涉及个人恩怨
But I know it's personal with this guy

284
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,900
这种情况通常没有好下场
and that never ends well.

285
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,460
我们依然有机会退出
You still have time to get out.

286
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,570
迈克说得对  哈维
Mike's right, Harvey.

287
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,350
你不会想和这人对着干的
You do not wanna go up against this man.

288
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,630
我甚至都不记得这个人
I don't even remember this guy.

289
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,160
你还指望我临阵退缩吗
You expect me to run scared?

290
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,280
我可记得他
Well I remember him. 

291
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,600
三年来你表现得像是这人不存在一样
You acted like he didn't exist for three years.

292
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,630
但他很卑鄙  且诡计多端
But he is sneaky and he is conniving 

293
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,640
更别提如今他有检察院在背后支持
and now he's got the power of the AG's office behind him.

294
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,050
我不在乎他背后有谁
I don't care what office he has.

295
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,600
他记得我而我不记得他的唯一原因就是
The only reason he remembers me and I don't remember him

296
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,860
他很烂  而我很棒
is he sucked and I was awesome.

297
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,330
假如你跟我说几年下来
And if you're telling me that between then and now

298
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,210
我止步不前而他突飞猛进  我可不买账
I've stalled and he's skyrocketed, I'm not buying it.

299
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,580
我觉得唐娜是想说  这家伙就像是
I think what Donna's trying to say is that this guy

300
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,680
路易・利特和艾略特・斯坦普尔的合体
is like Louis Litt and Elliott Stemple rolled into one.

301
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,040
和这种人  能避免交战就该尽量避免
And if you can avoid a fight with him, you should. 

302
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,550
我们之间必有一战
Well, I can't avoid a fight with him 

303
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,970
因为刚刚是我们挑起了战争
because we just picked one.

304
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,500
不管你俩怎么想的
And despite what you both seem to think,

305
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,730
我能对付得了他
I can handle him.

306
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,550
你马上就有机会对付他了
Well, you're gonna get your chance.

307
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,020
因为他刚刚传讯了我们的客户
'Cause he just subpoenaed our new client.

308
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,600
路易  我很抱歉
Louis, I'm so sorry. 

309
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,310
我一不小心就失控了
I didn't mean to fly off the handle like that.

310
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,950
什么  你在逗我吗
What? Are you kidding?

311
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,540
这是我这周经历的最棒的事了
That was the best thing I've seen in weeks.

312
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,560
所以...你不生我的气
So...you're not mad?

313
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,180
生气  我完全被镇住了
Mad? I'm blown away.

314
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,360
感觉看到了一只凶狠霸气的蝴蝶
It was like watching a fierce, manly butterfly 

315
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,700
从它又娘又小的茧里破茧而出
emerge from its pussy little cocoon.

316
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,090
那个布莱恩是从哪冒出来的
Where the hell did that Brian come from?

317
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,520
我也说不清  我猜你说我什么都可以
I don't know. I guess you can say a lot of things about me, 

318
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,220
但你一旦侮辱我当父亲的能力...
but when you insult my ability as a father--

319
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,390
就能唤醒你心中的雄狮
It brings out the lion in you.

320
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,550
之类的吧
Something like that.

321
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,550
但我保证  这种情况不会再发生了
But I promise, it won't happen again.

322
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,640
但我希望它能再次发生
But I want it to happen again.

323
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,650
实际上  你起草那份限制令的时候
In fact, when you draft the restraining order,

324
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,330
我想让你想象那个混蛋
I want you picturing that asshole

325
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,420
和他朋友说笑你是个多么糟糕的父亲
laughing to his buddies about what a shitty father you are.

326
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,110
写开庭陈述时想想这些
Think about it when you're writing the opening,

327
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,190
写到一半时想想这些
think about it in the middle,

328
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,410
写结案陈词时也要想一想
and definitely think about it when you write the close.

329
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,630
因为从今往后  我只要狮王布莱恩
Because Mufasa Brian is the only Brian I want to see from now on.

330
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,630
{\an8}《狮子王》中辛巴的父亲

331
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,060
我们抓紧时间  我客户可是很忙的
Let's get on with this. My client's a busy woman.

332
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,130
很显然她忙到竟没觉察到
Apparently she's too busy to realize 

333
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,260
她雇了一家会出卖自己客户的律所
she just hired a firm that's willing to sell out their own clients.

334
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,770
你什么意思
What the hell are you talking about?

335
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,780
别装了
Oh, come on.

336
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,860
你肯定知道威廉・萨特的下场了
You must be aware of what happened with William Sutter.

337
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,370
事实是在那种情况下
What happened was Harvey got him a better deal

338
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,660
哈维帮他达成的协议不能更好了
than anyone could have under the circumstances.

339
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,190
把他送进监狱里面  这是个好协议吗
Is that what you call sending him to prison? A great deal? 

340
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,880
但愿你除了翻翻我们公司老账
I hope there's more to your legal strategy 

341
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,860
还有其他法律策略  安德
than talking shit about my firm, Andy.

342
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,310
看来你去找人打听我了
Oh, I see you asked someone who I was.

343
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,280
好不容易才找到个还记得你的人
Took a while to find someone who actually remembered.

344
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,600
现在向我客户提问吧
Now ask my client an actual question

345
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
否则会面马上终止
or I'm shutting this down right now.

346
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,800
好  那我就问一个
Okay, here's one: 

347
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,650
斯坦格夫人  跟我说说你为何12月31日
Mrs. Stanger, why don't you tell me why one of your divisions

348
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,020
下午11点53突然将一个部门售出
suddenly needed to be sold on December 31st at 11:53 P.M.?

349
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,650
我们达成了盼望已久的协议
We finally got the offer that we'd been waiting for.

350
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,690
这份协议比上次谈判少了8百万
An offer worth 8 million less than the last one. 

351
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,710
没记错的话  副检察长
Last time I checked, being a Deputy AG 

352
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,930
也不是批发海运的专家
doesn't make you an expert in wholesale shipping.

353
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,070
没错  但我的确是
No, but it sure as hell makes me an expert

354
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,100
高管非法锁定奖金的专家
on executives locking in their bonuses illegally.

355
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,220
-不是这  -他在引诱你  别回答
- That is not-- - He's baiting you. Don't respond. 

356
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,770
我没有引诱她  我在取证
I'm not baiting. I'm deposing. 

357
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,890
那你为什么不问些有真凭实据的问题
Then why don't you ask a goddamn question based on evidence

358
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,210
把你的长篇大论留在法庭以外
and save your speeches for outside the courthouse?

359
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,280
你是否有意欺骗你的股东
Did you knowingly defraud your shareholders

360
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,310
-来增加自己的奖金  -别回答
- to inflate your own bonus? - Don't answer that.

361
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,350
那你有没有告知董事会
Did you inform your board of directors

362
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,790
你以低价达成协议
that you were taking a below market offer?

363
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,940
也别回答
Don't answer that either. 

364
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,510
你们有很多不能回答的问题
Wow, you're getting a lot of, "Don't answer that question." 

365
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,910
我明白为什么他们这么值钱了
I can see why they're worth the big bucks. 

366
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,330
听着  混蛋  我的客户是清白的
Listen to me, asshole. My client's innocent.

367
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,500
你除了含沙射影什么证据也没有
And you come at her with nothing but innuendo, 

368
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,480
她要用《第五修正案》
she's taking the 5th.

369
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,930
我来告诉你些从你不当检察官以后
Well, let me tell you something that you may not know 

370
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,400
你可能不知道的事
since you left being a prosecutor:

371
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,190
清白的人不会引用《第五修正案》
innocent people never take the 5th.

372
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,210
你要引用  我就把刑事案放一边
And if you try that, I'll put the criminal case on hold,

373
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,430
我会把董事会弄上民事指控
I'll bring the board up on civil charges 

374
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,580
相信我  在我给他们开条件之前
and believe me, they will roll over on her 

375
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,590
他们就会向她倒戈的
before I'm finished offering them the chance.

376
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,740
-他能这么做吗  -没错  我能
- Can he do that? - Yes, I can.

377
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,250
而且  你清不清白我根本不在乎
And for the record, i don't give a shit if you're innocent or not.

378
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,280
你就要坐牢了
You are going to prison.

379
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,170
这样印象够深刻了吧  哈维
How's that for making an impression, Harvey?

380
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,310
爸
Dad.

381
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,110
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

382
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,490
刚好路过
I was in the neighborhood.

383
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,170
我想到从你当上律师以后
I realized I haven't seen your office

384
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,890
我还没来过你办公室
since you became a member of the bar.

385
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,830
很高兴你这么说  但我办公室一点没变
Well, that's sweet but my office hasn't changed one bit

386
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,900
所以你还是告诉我你来的真实意图
so why don't you tell me what you're really doing here?

387
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,500
我来是要告诉你那步棋你走的很险
I came to tell you that was one hell of a move you made,

388
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,870
在改造公司案上用我女儿来对付我
using my own daughter against me with the Reform Corp. Case.

389
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,850
我不仅是你的女儿  我是名律师
I'm not just your daughter. I'm a lawyer.

390
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,440
这正是我此行的目的  我想和你共事
That's why I'm here. I wanna work with you.

391
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,290
我没听懂
I don't follow.

392
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,610
瑞秋  弗兰克・加洛想改善和他女儿的关系
Rachel, Frank Gallo wanted to connect with his daughter

393
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,610
一直等到错过了机会
and waited until it was too late.

394
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,080
我可不想犯同样的错误
I don't wanna make that same mistake.

395
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,920
我很高兴你这么说  爸
And I appreciate that, Dad.

396
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,660
但是我也说的很清楚了
But I've also made it really clear

397
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,850
我想按自己的方式来
that I wanna make my own way.

398
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,910
我不是想让你换律所
Oh, I'm not talking about you switching firms.

399
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,420
我说的是个无偿案
I'm talking about a pro bono.

400
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,990
我知道你去年和杰西卡做过一个
Now I know you did one with Jessica last year,

401
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,780
我想是时候你和我也能做一个
I thought maybe it was time you did one with me.

402
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,530
-什么案子  -掠夺性贷款
- What kinda case? - Predatory lending.

403
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,910
占有色人种的便宜
Taking advantage of people of color.

404
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,530
我很乐意
I'd really like that.

405
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,030
但是我得先跟哈维说清楚
But I have to clear it with Harvey first.

406
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,410
不用了  我告诉他我想和我的家人共事
No, you don't. I told the man I wanted to work with my family 

407
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,220
他说  "当然可以  罗伯特
and he said, "Of course, Robert.

408
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,630
这种事我非常赞同"
How can I stand in the way of that?"

409
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,010
这样的话
Well, in that case. 

410
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,570
我觉得我们应该去你办公室一趟
I think we should head back to your office 

411
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,200
做好准备让这些混蛋瞧瞧
and get ready to show those bastards 

412
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,360
赞恩父女联手有多厉害
what the team of Zane and Zane can do.

413
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,160
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

414
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,870
不  不用  我刚和最后一个董事
No, we don't. I just got off the phone

415
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,910
通完电话
with the last board member.

416
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,120
我们得把他们聚到一起
We need to get 'em in a room

417
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,470
在马利克找到机会递传票前
and lock 'em down before Malik

418
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,650
先把他们稳住
gets a chance to issue subpoenas.

419
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,710
哈维  你听到他的话了  这不够
Harvey, you heard him. It's not gonna be enough.

420
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,510
-你在说什么  -我是说趁来得及
- What are you saying? - I'm saying that we cut a deal

421
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,660
我们付钱达成协议
to pay a fine while we still can.

422
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,770
-你在开玩笑吗  -听我说
- Are you kidding me? - Listen to me,

423
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,350
我看到那女人脸上的表情了
I saw the look on that woman's face.

424
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,030
她确实做了  董事会会知道的
She did it, and the board's gonna know it.

425
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,880
只要他把这事弄上民事法庭
The second that he makes this civil,

426
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,430
他们就会向她倒戈  如他所言
they're gonna turn on her, just like he said.

427
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,570
我明白怎么回事了
I get what this is.

428
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,810
你什么意思
What the hell are you talking about?

429
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,280
你想用这个案子补偿
You brought me this to make up

430
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,990
你在无偿案上
for your pro bono fixation

431
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,500
对我捣的乱
messing with my business.

432
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,160
现在你发现她是有罪的
And now you found out that she's guilty,

433
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,500
你想一走了之  因为这有违你的准则
so you wanna cut and run 'cause it goes against your code.

434
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,690
不是这样的
That's bullshit.

435
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,040
我和她签约时就知道她不是清白的
I knew she was guilty the second I signed her.

436
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,900
哈维  我们讨论的不是
Harvey, we're not talking about

437
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,740
什么化学公司引发了癌症
some chemical company causing cancer.

438
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,930
我们谈论的是一个有钱人
We're talking about one rich person

439
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,690
从另外的有钱人身上偷钱
stealing money from other rich people.

440
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,960
我建议达成协议是因为他确实有我们的把柄
I'm saying that we cut a deal because he's got us.

441
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,420
她没给他留下任何把柄
He doesn't have shit because she didn't give him anything.

442
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,580
这对他都无关紧要
That doesn't matter to him

443
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,930
对陪审团也不重要
and it's not gonna matter to a jury

444
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,340
因为不管我们怎么想  她都有罪
because she's guilty whether we like it or not.

445
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,840
-你刚刚在说什么  -我说她是有罪的
- What did you just say? - I said she's guilty.

446
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,060
不  你说这对他来说并不重要
No, you said it doesn't matter to him.

447
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,440
但是她对他并不重要  我们有他
But she doesn't matter to him and we got him

448
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,870
承认的录影带
on tape admitting it.

449
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,510
马利克不止是公司律师
Malik's not just some corporate lawyer.

450
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,640
他还是个公务员
He's a public servant.

451
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,570
我记得  公务员
And last I checked, public servants

452
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,590
必须在意被告是否有罪
are supposed to give a shit if someone's guilty or not.

453
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,650
天哪  解决他了
Holy shit. We've got him.

454
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,460
斯诺思琪女士  我叫瑞秋・赞恩
Ms. Sonowski? My name's Rachel Zane,

455
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,350
这是我父亲罗伯特・赞恩
this is my father Robert Zane.

456
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,200
我们约好了吗
Did we have an appointment? 

457
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,780
因为我今天行程很满
Because I have a full schedule today.

458
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,390
那你就得因为这桩官司把行程都推掉
Then you're gonna have to clear it because this lawsuit

459
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,340
这已变成你的头等大事了
just became your number one priority.

460
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,480
种族歧视诉讼  真不敢相信
A discrimination suit. This is unbelievable.

461
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,820
让人不敢相信的是
What's unbelievable is that your bank

462
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,980
你的银行以为自己可以多年来剥削客户
thought they could rip people off for years

463
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,240
-而不被人发现  -我猜猜  你要
- without anyone noticing. - Let me guess, you're gonna

464
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,210
用这东西侮辱我一番
slap me with this and turn around

465
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,980
然后转身就要求和解
and 15 seconds later tell me you wanna settle.

466
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,690
我什么都不想和解
I don't wanna settle anything.

467
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,400
我要对你们的总裁取证
I wanna depose your CEO.

468
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,660
这是不可能发生的
Well, that's not gonna happen.

469
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,110
怎么不可能  这是合法的诉讼
Bullshit, it's not. This is a legitimate lawsuit.

470
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,950
我们还是跳过
Then why don't we skip the part

471
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,460
这个互相攻击的阶段
where you punch me and I counterpunch you

472
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,860
直接告诉我你能接受的底价吧
and you go ahead and give me your bottom line number right now.

473
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,620
一
One.

474
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,870
-一什么  -一个
- One what? - One son of a bitch

475
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,090
专门压榨别人的混蛋
who's been screwing over people.

476
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,270
这就是我的底价
That's my number.

477
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,040
我想要这个混蛋低头认罪
And I want the man's head on a platter.

478
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,590
那我们就法庭见吧
Then I guess I'll see you in court.

479
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,350
因为我不会让你
Because I'm not gonna let you

480
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,590
那么轻易就取证我的上司
depose my boss without a fight.

481
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,070
先生们  你们为什么来这里
Okay, gentlemen, why exactly are we here?

482
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,430
法官大人  我们来这里的原因是
Your Honor, we're here because this is

483
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,410
这是一起捏造的控诉  不应进行下去
a trumped up charge that shouldn't be allowed to go forward.

484
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,760
如果真的是捏造的
If it's so trumped up,

485
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,850
你的委托人为什么
why wouldn't your client answer

486
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,570
-拒绝回答任何问题  -因为她的工作是
- a single question about it? - Because it's her job

487
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,710
保护自己的公司  而不是提供
to protect her company, not offer up information

488
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,500
-不利于公司的信息  -扯淡
- to be used against it. - Bullshit.

489
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,190
你的委托人只想保护她自己的红利
All your client cares about is protecting her bonus.

490
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,110
而你只想
And all you care about

491
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,700
让自己出名
is making a name for yourself

492
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,680
即使是以陷害无辜的人为代价
even if it means taking down innocent people.

493
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,370
斯佩克特先生  你这样
Mr. Specter, I'd think very carefully

494
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,970
指控一位副检察长
before accusing a Deputy Attorney General

495
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,600
-需要谨慎  -我不是在指控他
- of something like that. - I'm not accusing him

496
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,110
法官大人
of anything, Your Honor.

497
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,400
我在逐字重复
I'm repeating exactly

498
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,650
他对我的委托人说的话  有录音为证
what he told my client on tape.

499
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,890
什么  你在说谎
What? That's a lie.

500
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,200
你想听一下录音吗
You want us to play it for you?

501
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,680
我们录下了他说的话
We have him on tape saying

502
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,500
他说他根本不在乎珍妮特・斯坦格
he doesn't give a shit whether Janet Stanger

503
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,460
-是不是无辜的  -法官大人
- is innocent or not. - Your Honor,

504
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,610
那只是我一时冲动说的话
that was said in the heat of the moment.

505
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,390
-我不是那么想的  -你是说  你那么说
- I did not mean that literally. - You mean you only said it

506
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,650
只是为了恐吓我的客户
to intimidate my client.

507
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,270
-那不是恐吓  -那到底是什么
- It wasn't intimidation. - Then what the hell was it?

508
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,800
-你这个人渣  -马利克先生
- You piece of shit. - Mr. Malik.

509
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,570
我很欣赏你在华尔街的工作
I like what you've been doing for Wall Street.

510
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,820
但我不会允许你为了展现个人成绩
But I'm not letting you prosecute a fabricated case

511
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,980
而在我的法庭上进行这种捏造的控告
in my courtroom just to get another notch in your belt.

512
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,090
我没有那么做
That's not what I'm doing.

513
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,110
给你24小时时间  证明他们错了
Then you have 24 hours to prove them wrong.

514
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,230
我建议你别再继续骂人
So I suggest you stop calling them names

515
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,230
赶紧给自己的案子找点证据
and go find yourself some evidence.

516
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,640
{\an8}希拉・赛兹

517
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,530
路易  小气鬼婴儿用品那家的混蛋在一号线上
Louis, that asshole from Cheapskate Baby is on line one.

518
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,570
-路易  -你说什么
- Louis. - What'd you say?

519
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,240
我说那个坑骗我们委托人的混蛋
I said that sucker that's trying to rip off

520
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,480
给你打电话了
our client's calling.

521
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,620
明显他收到布莱恩的临时禁制令了
Evidently, he got Brian's TRO.

522
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,100
那他可要大哭一场了
Which means he's about to cry his eyes out.

523
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,000
这正是我所需要的  他在几号线来的
This is just what I needed. What line did you say?

524
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,810
一号
One.

525
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,610
汉克  看来你已经收到临时禁制令了
Hank, I understand you got our TRO.

526
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,020
-没错  -我估计你打电话是为了
- I sure as hell did. - But I assume you're calling

527
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,910
求我不要让你们的产品全军覆没
to beg me to let you keep a piece of your product.

528
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,750
哥们  很抱歉  这是不可能的
Well, sorry to tell you, buddy. That's not gonna happen.

529
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,030
你怎么没哭呢
Why don't I hear crying?

530
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,570
你的新律师把禁制令送过来之前
You didn't read that thing before your associate

531
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,040
你都没读过吧
sent it over, did you?

532
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,660
我当然读过
Well, of course I read it.

533
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,290
哪有白痴把文件送过去之前
What kind of idiot doesn't read a document

534
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,020
自己读都不读
before sending it over?

535
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,570
就有这样的白痴  为我们的反诉
The kind that just opened the door for us

536
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,390
帮了个大忙
to countersue the shit out of him.

537
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,300
因为他正忙着惦记某个
Because he was too busy thinking about the woman

538
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,320
不可能嫁给他的女人
he's never going to marry.

539
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,580
-你刚说什么  -我说我是希拉的未婚夫
- What did you just say? - I said, I'm Sheila's fiancé

540
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,360
我知道你跟她睡过
and I know you slept with her.

541
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,210
现在  你还正在想着鬼鬼祟祟地...
And even now you're thinking about sneaking around and--

542
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,330
你不懂  这只是...
You don't understand, it was just--

543
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,250
仅此一次
A one-time thing?

544
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,470
你差点把我这辈子毁了
You could've ruined my life

545
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,250
你这个自私的混蛋
you selfish son of a bitch.

546
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,060
但我爱希拉  如果你以为
But I love Sheila, so if you think

547
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,570
这就能阻止她嫁给我  你就错了
this is gonna stop us from getting married, it's not.

548
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,840
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

549
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,050
我不是有意的
I didn't mean to.

550
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,030
你是不是有意的并不重要
It doesn't matter whether you meant it or not.

551
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,850
你要以为这能阻止我们的产品投入市场
If you think this is gonna stop us from going to market,

552
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,080
那你就连那个
you're an even shittier lawyer

553
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,650
愧为律师的菜鸟都不如
than that sorry excuse for an associate.

554
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,280
-你好  路易  -别跟我说你好
- Louis, hey. - Don't hey me.

555
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,810
-是你提交的临时禁制令吗  -是
- Did you file that TRO? - Yeah.

556
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,590
-早上一来就交了  -你提交之前读了吗
- First thing this morning. - And did you read it before you did?

557
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,500
当然
Of course.

558
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,760
那你是文盲吗
Then what are you, illiterate?

559
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,290
你送过去了一份禁制令  上面写着
Because that's the only reason I can think of

560
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,970
"他们的产品比不上我们的"
as to why you'd send a restraining order

561
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,870
只有文盲才会这么干
that says their product's inferior to ours.

562
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,740
-什么  -对  "比不上"
- What? - That's right, inferior.

563
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,920
比不上就是不一样
As in, different.

564
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,350
不  我不可能用了这个词
No, I couldn't have used that word.

565
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,460
看来你是世界上最烂的律师  因为你确实
Well, you could've if you're the world's worst lawyer,

566
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,930
用了这个词
which you apparently are.

567
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,320
这整个案子都被你搞砸了
Because you just invalidated our whole goddamn case.

568
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,150
因为不同的产品不可能
Because if they're different, they couldn't have

569
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,340
-侵犯专利  -路易  我真的很抱歉
- violated our patent. - Okay, Louis, I am so sorry.

570
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,860
你让我想着他嘲笑我的样子  想着他说
You told me to think of that guy laughing

571
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,550
-我是个不称职的父亲  -你是说这怪我
- and how bad a father I was-- - Are you saying this is my fault?

572
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,400
不是...
No, I--

573
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,420
这不怪我  这都是你的错
Because this is not my fault, this is your fault.

574
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,000
我知道  我真的很抱歉
I know. I am so sorry.

575
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,020
免了  你别参与这个案子了
No. What you are is off this case.

576
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,560
-拜托  路易  -不  你给我闭嘴
- Louis, please. - No. You shut the hell up!

577
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,580
我们的委托人把特别而珍爱的东西
Our client trusted you with something special,

578
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,800
委托给你
with something they love.

579
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,690
而你在他们背后
And then you snuck around behind their back

580
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,380
做了愚蠢而不计后果的事情
and you did something stupid and reckless.

581
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,970
你毁掉了他们的生活
And you ruined their life,

582
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,950
你这个一文不值的自私的混蛋
you worthless, selfish son of a bitch!

583
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,600
法官大人  这家银行存在掠夺性贷款的行为
Your Honor, this bank has a practice of predatory lending.

584
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,190
这种行为自上而下
It starts at the top and we can end

585
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,780
我们可以取证他们的总裁  结束这一切
this whole thing quickly by deposing their CEO.

586
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,090
他们想速战速决  因为他们没有证据
They need to end this quickly because they have nothing.

587
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,070
要是每次律师申请  我的就要接受取证
And if every time a lawyer wanted to sit down my client

588
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,270
他就没法工作了
and depose him, he'd never be able to do his job.

589
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,070
多棒的论据  "你们不能对他取证
What a wonderful argument. "You can't depose us,

590
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,270
因为我们正忙着压榨客户"
because we're too busy screwing over our clients."

591
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,960
赞恩先生  如果你需要对一位重要人士取证
Mr. Zane, if you wanna tie up an important man

592
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,350
使其长达几小时无法正常工作
for hours on end, you need to show

593
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,020
你要有足够的证据作为支撑
there's enough evidence to warrant it.

594
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,360
我会给出证据的  法官大人
I'll give you evidence, Your Honor.

595
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,300
我们会把约翰・富勒资料上交陪审团
We'll show the jury John Fuller,

596
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,610
他每年赚取八万美金而且也有自己的事业
who makes $80,000 a year and has his own business.

597
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,960
此外我们也会提交梅格・格罗斯曼的资料
And then we'll show them Meg Grossman,

598
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,830
年收入相同但信用卡债务数额与其持平
who makes the same but has at least that much

599
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,240
-甚至更大  -而后我们会询问陪审团
- in credit card debt. - And then we'll ask the jury

600
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,740
谁更有可能获得条件更好的抵押贷款
who they would give the better mortgage to.

601
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,530
我们敢保证12名陪审员都会选富勒先生
And we're willing to bet that all 12 would pick Mr. Fuller.

602
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,060
而要不是他是非裔美国人的话
Which is who his bank would've picked

603
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,630
他的银行也应当作出同样选择的
if he weren't African American.

604
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,170
法官大人  他们挑出的是两个个案
Your Honor, they're picking two cases.

605
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,910
-一百个里选了两个  -我确信这可以找到解释
- Two out of 100. - And I'm sure there's an explanation.

606
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,920
那让你该死的总裁过来解释
Then get your goddamn CEO in here to give it.

607
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,570
够了  赞恩先生
That's enough, Mr. Zane.

608
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,320
我同意让你立案
I'm willing to let you build a case,

609
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,800
但要让我支持你的指责
but I need evidence your claims are true

610
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,840
你需要提供证据来证明其真实性
before I'm gonna let you figure out who to blame.

611
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,150
-法官大人  -你可以首先
- Your Honor-- - You can start

612
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,020
让相关的信贷员出庭作证
by deposing the loan officers.

613
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,830
但除非证据充足到足以立案
But unless there's enough there to make a case,

614
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,390
你只能到此为止
that's all you're gonna get.

615
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,140
格蕾琴  你在这里干什么  出去
Gretchen, what the hell are you doing here? Get out.

616
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,850
我不出去
I'm not going anywhere.

617
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,530
你无权如此对待那孩子
You had no business treating that boy like that.

618
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,900
你知道吗  如果你准备
Well, you know what? If all you're gonna do

619
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,550
对我指手画脚  在我看来
is judge me, as far as I'm concerned,

620
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,380
布莱恩不是唯一能逃过被解雇的幸运儿
Brian's not the only one lucky not to be fired.

621
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,300
-你刚对我说什么  -你没听错
- What did you say to me? - You heard me.

622
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,720
走开  否则你就等着卷铺盖走人吧
Back off or you're gone.

623
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,600
那你最好听着
Then you better hear this:

624
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,060
你说过他们都是你的孩子
you say those kids are your children.

625
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,450
而父亲不会那样对待他的孩子
Well, a father doesn't treat his children that way.

626
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,530
你知道你在说些什么吗
You don't know what you're talking about.

627
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,450
我不知道个鬼
The hell I don't!

628
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,480
你暴躁易怒  口出恶言
You were nasty and abusive.

629
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,980
如果他真的是你的儿子  我会马上
And if he were your son, I'd be calling

630
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,090
-报告儿童服务机构  -但他不是
- Child Services right now. - Well, he's not my son!

631
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,800
他是一名律师  而且这不关你的事
He's a lawyer and this is none of your goddamn business.

632
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,930
不关我的事
None of my business?

633
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,940
照顾你的人和工作就是我的事
Watching your back is my goddamn business.

634
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,360
我不知道发生了什么
I don't know what the hell is going on

635
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,220
让你不愿和利普希茨谈一谈
with you that you don't wanna talk to Lipschitz about,

636
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,850
但你最好给我好好处理这事
but you better get a handle on it.

637
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,930
因为如果你也这样对待其他的律师
Because if you treat another associate like that,

638
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,110
我会好好教训你
I will knock you the hell out.

639
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,760
现在就举杯庆祝胜利不会太早了吗
Isn't it a little early for a victory drink?

640
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,840
你看见马利克的表情了吗
Did you see the look on Malik's face?

641
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,830
要我说这酒已经迟了几小时了
I'd say we're a couple of hours late.

642
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,330
那我想我也得和你喝一杯了
Then I guess I better join you.

643
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,350
因为到明天  华尔街得所有人都会知道
'Cause by tomorrow, all of Wall Street's gonna know

644
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,440
安迪・马利克和皮尔逊・斯佩克特・利特作对
that Andy Malik went up against Pearson Specter Litt

645
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
而且还破天荒地输了
and lost in record time.

646
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,930
迈克  谢谢你交给我这起案子
Thanks for bringing me this case, Mike.

647
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,810
别客气  哈维  我还想说
You're welcome, Harvey. And for the record,

648
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,980
抱歉我之前说你应该认输
I'm sorry I said you should've thrown in the towel.

649
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,110
没关系  我也很抱歉你这么说了
It's okay. I'm sorry you said it, too.

650
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,220
再多给我来一杯  我也想庆祝了
Got an extra glass? I feel like celebrating, too.

651
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,570
马利克  你在这里干什么
What are you doing here, Malik?

652
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,920
我是来这里给你们这个的
I'm here to deliver this.

653
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,010
是什么
What's that?

654
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,290
是明天的报纸
It's a copy of tomorrow's paper.

655
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,950
我必须递交所有的证据  不像你
I'm required to hand over all discovery and unlike you,

656
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,460
-我照着要求做了  -这是什么意思
- I comply with that requirement. - What's that supposed to mean?

657
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,730
你明天就会知道了
Oh, you'll find out what it means tomorrow.

658
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,850
那为什么你今晚特意过来一趟
Then why did you come all the way down here

659
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,210
把报纸给我们
to give us this tonight?

660
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,470
因为我想在我反败为胜的时候
Because I wanted to see the look on your face

661
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,970
能观摩到你们脸上的表情
when I told you that I've got you,

662
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,300
你这个混球
you cocky son of a bitch.

663
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,550
如果你想打开录音设备
Oh, and if you wanna turn on your recorder,

664
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,120
尽管开  我会对着
go right ahead, 'cause I'll say that

665
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,330
镜头来说
right to the camera.

666
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,040
晚安  先生们  享用你们的酒吧
Good night, gentlemen. Enjoy your drinks.

667
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,770
唐娜  我发现你总是处于同样的处境
Donna. I see you're in the same position as you always were.

668
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,410
我发现你和哈维一样总是
And I see you have the same Harvey-sized

669
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,360
总是爱找麻烦
chip on your shoulder you've always had.

670
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,130
-情况有多差  -很差
- How bad is it? - Bad.

671
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,530
他们拿到了确凿的证据
They got a smoking gun?

672
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,460
而且还有大王牌
And the bullet and the body, too.

673
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,760
那么你们打算怎么做
So what are you gonna do?

674
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,300
我们得先搞清楚发生了什么事
We're gonna find out what the hell's going on here.

675
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,090
那是什么
What is that?

676
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,640
我的辞职信
My letter of resignation.

677
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,340
我不会在这种人手下工作的
I'm not gonna work for a man like that.

678
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,550
-哪种人  -你在开玩笑吗
- A man like what? - Are you kidding me?

679
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,080
我知道你看见了
I know you saw that.

680
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,700
我不打算忍受疯子对我的欺凌
And I'm not gonna put up with being bullied by a nut job.

681
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,340
我没像别人那样起诉他  他该感到幸运
He's lucky I don't sue him like everybody else.

682
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,820
- 什么  - 我说他很幸运
- Excuse me? - I said, he's lucky

683
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,790
我没像其他人那样起诉他
I don't sue him like everybody else.

684
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,330
你知道吗  小喽
Well, you know what, you little pissant?

685
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,010
你何不试试呢
Why don't you go ahead and try?

686
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,190
因为他不费吹灰之力就能把无能的你
Because he will take your little incompetent ass

687
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,450
打败而大获全胜
and wipe the floor with you.

688
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,650
-什么  -你对我的误解
- What? - Oh, did you misunderstand me,

689
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,920
就如同你误解你的岗位一样
the way you misunderstood the assignment you were given?

690
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,460
因为也许你根本没有获得重视
Because maybe you weren't paying attention.

691
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,710
你辞职也许只能让律所损失一个客户而已
You may have just cost this firm a client.

692
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,090
胡说  他无权那样对待我
Bullshit. He had no right to treat me that way.

693
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,200
我不管他有没有权利
I don't give a shit what he had a right to.

694
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,730
如果你是我的儿子  我会告诉你
If you were my son, I would tell you

695
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,760
这是你自己的官司和乱子
this is your case and your mess.

696
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,800
我不是你的儿子  而且他把我赶走了
Well, I'm not your son. And he kicked me off.

697
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,980
与其像婴儿一样逃避
And instead of being a baby and running away,

698
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,270
身为男人会想办法留下并清除这乱子
a man would figure out a way to stay and clean up.

699
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,910
决定权在你
It's up to you.

700
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,410
但千万别再在我面前
But don't you dare talk shit about my boss

701
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,160
说我老板的闲话
to my face ever again.

702
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,680
我希望你们来告诉我此案
Well, I hope you're here to tell me the case

703
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,710
-将不予受理  -我们是来问你
- is getting dismissed. - We're here to ask you

704
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,530
你是否在公务便条上明确指示你的团队
if you wrote a memo instructing your team

705
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,670
要不惜一切卖掉那个部门
to sell that division for whatever it takes.

706
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,970
-不  我没有  - 那为什么
- No, I didn't. - Then why the hell

707
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,700
这报纸报道写着你有这么做
does the "Journal" Say you did?

708
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,350
-这太荒谬了  -之所以荒谬
- This is ridiculous. - Ridiculous because

709
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,260
是因为报道是假的还是你没写过便条
it isn't true or because you didn't write it?

710
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,250
-我没写过  -但这报道是真的
- I didn't write it. - But it is true.

711
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,220
我也许有提过如果能在年末前把一个部门
I may have mentioned it would be in our best interest

712
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,330
卖出去  对我们是最有利的
if a division was sold before the end of the year.

713
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,250
但我没有蠢到把这写到便条上
But I was never dumb enough to write it in a memo.

714
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,770
不  你就是蠢到把个人利益
No, you're just dumb enough to put your interests

715
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,220
-置于公司利益之上  -我代表公司
- in front of your company's. - I am this company.

716
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,100
我们的利益是一致的
Our interests are the same.

717
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,190
你们忘了你们是站在哪一边的吗
Or have you forgotten what side you're on?

718
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,740
我们一点都没忘
We haven't forgotten anything.

719
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,720
如果我们不了解全部实情就无法为你辩护
And we can't defend you if we don't have all the information.

720
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,750
那你现在了解了  我没有写过公务便条
Well now you have it. I didn't write the memo.

721
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,930
我没记错的话  是你们
And as I recall, you were the ones

722
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,070
刚过来敲我办公室的门
who came knocking on my door.

723
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,350
与其在半夜来我办公室
So instead of coming into my office in the middle

724
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,390
何不去做好你们的本分工作
of the night, why don't you do your job

725
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,410
防止这件事被置于法庭之上
and stop this goddamn thing from getting into court?

726
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,660
哈维  如果你打算告诉我
Harvey, if you're gonna tell me

727
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,620
你不相信她  那你可以省省了
you don't believe her, you can save it.

728
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,990
-我不打算那么说  -为什么
- I'm not gonna tell you that. - Why not?

729
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,910
因为但凡客户声明他们有罪
Because when a client says they're guilty,

730
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,410
我只相信他们说的那不是他们用的枪
I believe them when they say that's not the gun they used.

731
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,550
你想说什么
Then what were you gonna say?

732
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,100
我认为他把文件送来
I think he brought us that paper

733
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
让我们白跑一趟
to send us on a wild goose chase,

734
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,110
是想搞清楚备忘录的出处
trying to figure out where that memo came from.

735
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,270
他为什么要这么做
Why would he wanna do that?

736
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,440
因为事实上他没有备忘录
Because he doesn't actually have it.

737
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,390
并且想把我们的视线从球上移开
And he wanted to take our eyes off the ball.

738
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,680
我没听懂  什么球
I don't get it. What ball?

739
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,040
就是他会试图利用那篇文章作为证据
The ball that says he's gonna try and

740
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,850
得到他还未承认存在的
use that article as evidence to get the memo

741
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,160
-备忘录  -他不能这么做
- that he doesn't have admitted. - He can't do that.

742
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,400
根据举证规则  如果备忘录存在
The rules of evidence say that if that thing exists

743
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,260
但他没有原件  纳他连提交复印件的权利都没有
and he doesn't have it, he can't even submit a copy of it,

744
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,870
更别说提交提及它的一篇文章了
let alone an article referring to it.

745
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,560
哈维  他还想
And that, Harvey, is the ball he's trying

746
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,130
遮蔽我们的视线
to keep our eyes off of.

747
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,680
这意味着我们明天得在法庭上
That means all we have to do is show up at court tomorrow

748
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,700
-阻止他  -很棒  迈克
- and stop him. - That's pretty good, Mike.

749
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,500
我不得不赞叹一下
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

750
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,420
我也赞叹你记得举证规则
I'm impressed you remember the rules of evidence.

751
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,050
-我是一名律师  你知道的  -说实话
- I am a lawyer, you know. - To tell you the truth,

752
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,250
有那么一些瞬间
between the hair and the short hours,

753
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,870
我都有点忘记这事了
I kinda forget it sometimes.

754
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,830
我不懂这是什么意思
I don't even know what that means.

755
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,510
我很确定你知道这是什么意思
I'm pretty sure you know what that means.

756
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,270
-晚安  迈克  -晚安  哈维
- Good night, Michael. - Night, Harvey.

757
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,010
好了  我们来过一遍计划
Okay, let's go over the plan.

758
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,550
好  我们让所有的信贷员以为
Okay, we make every one of these loan officers

759
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,250
我们已经看过他们的记录
think that we've seen their records.

760
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,950
如果他们不愿承认所做所为是上级要求
And if they're not willing to admit this came from the top,

761
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,550
我们就证明这是他们自己的决定
we're gonna show that they did this all on their own.

762
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,960
如此一来  我们向住房和城市发展部举报他们
In which case, we report them to HUD

763
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,890
他们就永远无法在银行工作了
and they never work in banking again.

764
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,730
-很好  -好的
- Good. - Good.

765
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,450
上次我们俩像现在这样
You know, the last time we worked together

766
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,330
一起工作是在...
on something like this was...

767
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,300
你帮我参加模拟联合国的时候
When you helped me with Model U.N.

768
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,110
我那时还在瑞士
I was Switzerland.

769
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,050
据我回忆
And as I recall,

770
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,290
你在瑞士的时候可没这么厉害
Switzerland's never kicked so much ass.

771
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,500
我很高兴你推迟了婚礼
I'm glad you put off that wedding.

772
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,420
什么
What?

773
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,930
-我以为你喜欢迈克  -我喜欢
- I thought you liked Mike. - I do.

774
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,450
但你推迟婚礼把时间用在工作上
But you put it off to spend time on your career.

775
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,810
正因为此
And because of that,

776
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,870
我现在才能跟你共处
I'm spending time with you right now.

777
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,330
路易  我很高兴你在这里
Louis. I'm glad you're here.

778
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,730
我也很高兴你在这里  布莱恩  我...
I'm glad you're here, too. Brian, I--

779
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,440
-我想说声抱歉  -你不必道歉
- I wanna say I'm sorry. - You don't have to apologize.

780
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,470
你说得对
You were right.

781
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,600
我把案子搞砸了
I messed up the case.

782
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,400
但我想给你看这个
But I wanna show you this.

783
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,930
你怎么想到这个的
How'd you come up with this?

784
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,130
想听实话吗  我很生气
The truth? I was pissed off

785
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,940
然后我忍不住去想你如何用同样的方式
and I couldn't stop thinking about how you keep treating us

786
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,040
一次又一次地折磨我们
the same way over and over again.

787
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,640
然后我突然想到  大多数人都有固定模式
And then I got to thinking, most people have a pattern.

788
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,070
-大多数公司也是如此  -没错
- And most companies do, too. - Exactly.

789
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,090
布莱恩  这可是很大的工作量
Brian, this is an amazing amount of work.

790
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,260
我熬了一整夜完成的
I stayed up all night doing it.

791
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,990
但我以为你熬夜陪儿子去了
But I thought you take the night shift with your son.

792
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,600
通常是的  但我告诉我妻子
Usually, but I told my wife

793
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,810
昨晚她来接替我
she'd have to take it last night

794
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,890
因为我不想被人指责
because I don't like being accused

795
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,970
是一个糟糕的父亲
of being a bad father.

796
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,330
但我不能让这种恐惧导致我变成一个烂律师
But I won't abide it making me a bad lawyer.

797
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,250
我不明白
Uh, I don't understand.

798
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,080
这怎么会让你成为烂律师
How does that make you a bad lawyer?

799
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,050
我并不是说这是你的错
I am not saying that it's your fault.

800
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,360
但当我想象他嘲笑我时
But when I pictured him laughing at me,

801
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,400
我很失控
I lost control.

802
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,010
我写下了糟糕的话
And I wrote the word inferior

803
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,430
是因为我想攻击他
because I was lashing out at him.

804
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,710
因为事实是...
Because the truth is...

805
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,340
我害怕成为一个糟糕的父亲
I'm afraid I am a bad father.

806
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,190
你是个好父亲  布莱恩
You're a good father, Brian.

807
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,390
你怎么知道
How can you know that?

808
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,550
我就是知道  而且我还知道
Because I do, and I know what's it like

809
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,490
自己的不安全感妨碍了工作是什么感觉
to let your insecurities get in the way of your work,

810
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,450
相信我
believe me.

811
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,940
但现在  我们要从不安全感中
But right now, we're gonna channel the shit

812
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,040
走出来
out of our insecurities

813
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,700
然后去对付这些无耻的混蛋
and go spank these nipple-stealing motherfu--ers.

814
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,780
好吧
Okay.

815
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,030
法官  你给了我二十四小时
Your Honor, you gave me 24 hours to introduce evidence

816
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,120
为立案提交证据
that I have a case.

817
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,350
我想提交这个文件
Well, I would like to introduce this document.

818
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,010
法官  他想提交一篇文章
Your Honor, he's about to introduce

819
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,810
上面写着我的委托人
an article that says my client

820
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,810
主导了一次公司非法出售
directed an illegal sale of a company.

821
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,880
我手里就有一份这篇文章
Well, I have a copy of that article right here

822
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,120
除非他有文章提到的真实备忘录
and unless he has the actual memo it refers to,

823
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,100
否则这篇文章是不能采纳的
this article itself is inadmissible.

824
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,950
交给我看看
Let me see that.

825
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,180
法官  斯佩克特说得对
Your Honor, Mr. Specter's right,

826
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,190
我没有他口中的备忘录
I do not have the memo that he's referring to.

827
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,350
但既然他提起这个
But since he brought it up,

828
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,650
我想提交这篇文章的原因是  向法庭显示
the reason that I would like to have entered that article

829
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,030
该备忘录确实存在  并且他把它毁了
is to show the court that that memo existed and he buried it.

830
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,260
-什么  -马利克  这说法很离谱
- What? - Mr. Malik, that's an outrageous claim.

831
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,880
真正离谱的是他曾经也这么做
What's outrageous is that he's done it before

832
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,000
现在却依旧是律师
and he's still practicing law.

833
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,600
好吧  你这是撒谎  我想要这段话
Okay, that is a lie and I want that

834
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,110
-做无效处理  -这不是撒谎
- stricken from the record. - It's not a lie.

835
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,720
-我有证据  -鬼扯
- I can prove it. - Bullshit.

836
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,860
斯佩克特  够了
Mr. Specter, that's enough.

837
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,650
如果马利克无法证实他的主张
If Mr. Malik can't back up his allegation,

838
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,320
他会被指控藐视法庭
he'll be held in contempt of court.

839
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,760
但依据我的经验  老狗学不了新把戏
But in my experience, old dogs don't learn new tricks.

840
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,120
所以如果他能证明  再加上这篇文章
So if he can prove it, that combined with this article

841
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,010
我有理由相信你又故技重施
will give me reason to believe that you've done it again.

842
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,930
两天后开庭
We'll reconvene in two days.

843
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,490
他在说些什么
What the hell is he talking about?

844
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,160
无论如何  我向你保证
Whatever it is, I swear to you

845
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,120
等尘埃落定  我们会赢得庭审
that when the dust settles, we'll still win this thing.

846
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,760
混蛋  你才没有证据
You son of a bitch. You got nothing on me

847
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,130
因为我没做过
because there's nothing to have.

848
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,300
我证据多的是  唯一的问题是
Oh, I've got plenty. The only question is,

849
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,170
在你多次越界行为中
which one of the many times that you've crossed the line

850
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,210
我该对外揭露哪一次
am I planning on exposing to the world?

851
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,120
我希望你不会介意  我是在投桃报李
I hope you don't mind. I'm returning the favor.

852
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,930
你最好别在这里吼我
You better not be in here to yell at me.

853
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,320
我不会的  我来这里告诉你你说对了
I'm not. I'm here to tell you that you were right.

854
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,430
我很抱歉吼了你  格蕾琴
And I'm sorry I yelled at you, Gretchen.

855
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,820
我还很抱歉让你取消利普希茨的预约
And I'm also sorry I told you to cancel Lipschitz.

856
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,410
这是我说过最蠢的话了
I mean, that was the dumbest thing I've ever said.

857
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,190
不  路易  你说过最蠢的话是
No, Louis, the dumbest thing you've ever said

858
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,750
你叫我在办公室
was when you ordered me to adopt

859
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,230
养一窝暹罗猫
a family of Siamese cats for the office.

860
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,280
但你没有这样做
But you didn't do that.

861
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,110
我也没有取消利普希茨的预约
And I didn't cancel Lipschitz either.

862
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,750
我把时间改到了今晚六点
I moved him to 6:00 tonight.

863
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,730
六点  我不可能赶得上  现在太晚了
6? I'll never make it over there, it's too late.

864
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,120
所以庆幸的是我说服他到这里来
Then it's a good thing I convinced him to come here.

865
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,920
谢谢你  格雷琴
Thank you, Gretchen.

866
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,590
还有  我绝不会开除你
And for the record, I would never fire you.

867
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,000
我知道  路易
I know, Louis.

868
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,540
我知道
I know.

869
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,070
-戴维斯小姐  -你看起来很惊讶
- Ms. Davies? - You look surprised.

870
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,580
我们准时到了  对吧
We have the time right, don't we?

871
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,810
是的
Yes, you do.

872
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,810
我们开始前  我想指出
Before we get started, I would just like to point out

873
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,950
我们不仅要为我们的客户讨回公道
we're not just here to get justice for our clients.

874
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,520
我们还会保护你
We're also here to protect you.

875
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,500
小心  丽莎  他们试图博得你的信任
Careful, Lisa, they're trying to get your trust

876
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,110
然后在背后捅你一刀
before they stab you in the back.

877
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,410
-我们不会捅任何人  -我们有123个起诉人
- We're not stabbing anyone. - We have 123 plaintiffs

878
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,820
被操控负担更高的贷款汇率
who were all steered into higher rate mortgages

879
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,380
这些人都恰好是有色人种
all of whom happen to be people of color.

880
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,210
你的问题到底是什么
And what exactly is your question?

881
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,560
我们想知道谁给了你的客户这样的授权
We wanna know who gave your client the goddamn mandate.

882
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,270
-没有什么授权  -没有写到纸上
- There is no mandate. - Just because it's not

883
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,120
并不意味着没法想明白
written down doesn't mean it's not understood.

884
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,580
我在雅芳做了十年的信贷员
I've been a loan officer at Avon for ten years.

885
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,070
我们的贷款流程不允许出现歧视
Our lending process doesn't allow for discrimination.

886
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,050
-怎么可能  -一个电脑程序
- How is that possible? - A computer program

887
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,280
在准批人员看到申请之前
strips out race, gender, and photos

888
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,460
剔除种族  性别和照片信息
before approval officers ever see the application.

889
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,720
胡说  那为什么一开始要
Bullshit. Then why even ask for those things

890
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,080
-这些信息呢  -因为我们要防止
- in the first place? - Because we have to protect

891
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,780
-身份欺诈  -这些都没有阻止
against identity fraud. - And none of that

892
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,240
老板让你们拒绝512个人的
stops the boss from telling you to deny number 512

893
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,390
合法贷款
their rightful mortgage.

894
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,280
因为他是可恶的掠夺者
Because he's a predatory piece of shit

895
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,880
他用你这样的傻瓜打掩护
and he's using fools like you to cover his own ass!

896
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,950
-你说什么  -爸
- Excuse me? - Dad.

897
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,260
你怎么能为这样的人工作
How can you work for a man like that?

898
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,290
我绝不会在一个
I would never work for a place

899
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,330
有歧视的地方工作而且我很乐意
that engaged in discrimination and I am more than happy

900
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,620
-在法庭上这么说  -你会有机会的
- to say that on the stand. - Well, you're gonna

901
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,470
因为这里面有猫腻
get your chance because something is going on here

902
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,830
我会查到底
and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

903
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,500
-我们谈完了  -胡说  还没完
- We're done here. - Bullshit, we're done.

904
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,180
我们还有五个人要取证
We have five more people to depose.

905
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,480
他们会说和丽莎同样的话
And they're gonna say the exact same thing Lisa just did,

906
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,090
但我不会给你机会像你对待她一样
but I'm not gonna give you the chance to treat them

907
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,310
对待他们
the way you just treated her.

908
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,970
我会请愿法官
What I am gonna do is petition the judge

909
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,660
废掉这个案子
to have this case thrown out.

910
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,270
别告诉我你还想让我放弃
Don't tell me you still want me to give up

911
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,730
因为即使我想...
because even if I wanted to--

912
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,090
这不是我要说的
That's not what I'm here to say.

913
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,580
我们得弄明白他说的是哪个案子
We need to figure out what case he's talking about.

914
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,600
我知道哪个案子  他在地检办公室工作了十年
I know what case. He worked in the DA's office ten years.

915
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,900
他说的是克利福德・丹纳
He's talking about Clifford Danner.

916
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,320
哈维  这讲不通
Harvey, that doesn't make any sense.

917
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,630
你没有压着证据  那是卡梅隆・丹尼斯
You didn't suppress that evidence, Cameron Dennis did.

918
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,340
马利克才不管
Malik doesn't give a shit about that.

919
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,770
我是当时的检察官
I was the prosecuting attorney.

920
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,720
我应该知道自己案子的情况
I should've known what was happening with my own case,

921
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,050
意味着我们完了
which means we're screwed.

922
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,540
-除非...  -除非什么
- Unless-- - Unless what?

923
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,540
除非我们能让卡梅隆・丹尼斯承认
Unless we can get Cameron Dennis to admit

924
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,850
他隐藏了证据而你不知道
that he buried the evidence and that you didn't know about it.

925
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,540
迈克  卡梅隆才不会承认
Mike, there's no way Cameron's gonna admit to that.

926
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,070
-等等  -什么
- Wait a second. - What?

927
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,140
他也不能因为我没有做的事情
There's also no way he'd set me up

928
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,460
陷害我
for something I didn't do.

929
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,960
所以我们得找出马利克会怎样做
Which means we need to figure out how Malik's

930
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,140
看起来像是我隐藏了证据
gonna make it look like I suppressed that evidence.

931
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,050
他会传唤你办克利福德・丹纳时的
He's gonna subpoena the one other person who was there

932
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,700
另一个人
when you put Clifford Danner away.

933
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,800
-不  -他打给我要
- No. - Yes. He's calling me

934
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,040
两天后出庭
to the stand in two days.

935
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,270
我们得帮你准备好
Then we need to get you prepared.

936
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,060
我们得在大庭广众下做
And we need to do it in front of an audience.

937
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,480
你指的是模拟庭审吗
You're talking about a mock trial?

938
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,400
不行  我不会让唐娜这样
No way, I'm not putting Donna through that.

939
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,850
哈维  迈克说得对
Harvey, Mike's right.

940
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,940
但你不是那个让我承受这些的人
But you're not the one who has to put me through it,

941
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,580
-必须是路易  -唐娜
- it has to be Louis. - Donna,

942
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,540
你知道上次路易这么做的时候发生了什么
you know what happened last time Louis did that.

943
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,010
我知道  他很残忍
Yes, I do. He was brutal.

944
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,090
正是安德・马利克要做的
Which is exactly what Andy Malik's gonna be.

945
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,900
所以要么你告诉路易  要么我去
So either you can tell Louis or I will.

946
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,530
不管怎样  必须是他
But either way, it's gotta be him.

947
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,440
唐娜  即使我同意
Donna, even if I said yes,

948
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,320
上次路易这么做  他很难受
last time Louis did that, it made him sick.

949
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,760
他不会再想这样做的
He's not gonna wanna do that again.

950
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,760
他不会愿意
He won't want to.

951
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,130
但是他会做
But he will.

952
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,330
感谢抽空见我
Well, thanks for meeting me here.

953
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,240
当你推迟了我们的治疗
Well, when you put off our session,

954
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,870
我知道你一定在忙要紧的事
I knew you must be in the middle of something important.

955
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,920
不是因为这个
That's not why I put it off.

956
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,680
发生了什么  路易
What happened, Louis?

957
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,280
你还记得希拉吗
You remember Sheila?

958
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,740
当然
Yeah, of course.

959
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,810
她是我们多次谈话的主角
She was the subject of many of our conversations.

960
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,310
总而言之  她要结婚了
Yeah, well the long and short of it is she's getting married.

961
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,830
在她结婚之前  她想和我
And before she does, she wanted to have

962
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,130
共度最后一晚
one last night with me.

963
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,760
我没有告诉你
And I didn't tell you about it

964
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,920
是因为我怕你批判我
because I was afraid that you would judge me.

965
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,540
路易  我怎么看你的行为不重要
Louis, it doesn't matter what I think of your actions.

966
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,150
你怎么看
What do you think?

967
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,440
她说这会让她解脱开始新生活
She said it would free her to live her life.

968
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:52,060
我想让她快乐地生活
And I want her to be happy with her life,

969
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,360
即使不是和我
even if it's not with me.

970
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,980
那么你的出发点是对的
Then your heart is in the right place.

971
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,540
看到了吗  我的出发点不是问题
Don't you see? My heart is not the problem.

972
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,190
我不能忘掉她
I can't get her out of my head.

973
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,660
希拉
It's Sheila.

974
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,150
一直都是希拉
It's always been Sheila.

975
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,340
但是路易  我记得
But Louis, as I recall,

976
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,760
是你和她提出分手
it was you who ended it with her.

977
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,400
因为我想要孩子
Because I wanted to have a baby.

978
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,790
她不想
And she didn't.

979
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,790
而现在我什么都没有了
And now I'm not gonna have anything.

980
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,530
路易  我都明白
Louis, I understand all that.

981
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,350
但是根据格雷琴告诉我的情况
But from what Gretchen told me,

982
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,820
我想是时候想办法
I think it's time we figure out a way

983
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,820
防止你向周围的人出气了
for you to stop lashing out at those around you.

984
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,740
我以为你回办公室去了
I thought you went back to your office.

985
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,740
没有  我想给你一些时间
No, I didn't. I thought that I would

986
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,480
冷静下来之后
give you some time to calm down

987
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,140
告诉我实话
and think about telling me the truth

988
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,730
这是怎么一回事
about what is going on here.

989
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,410
没怎么回事
Nothing's going on.

990
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,690
爸  你说你想和我
Dad, you said that you wanted

991
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,960
更亲近
to be closer with me.

992
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,280
现在就是你的机会
Now's your chance.

993
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,390
这个案子无关乎种族或钱
This case isn't about race or money.

994
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,650
掌管这家公司的人是个彻彻底底的
That man who heads up this company is a predator,

995
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,810
掠夺者
through and through.

996
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,140
我想教训他因为有个人
And I wanted to get him back for going after

997
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,720
我曾有机会去帮助
the one person I should've helped when I had the chance.

998
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,830
却没有
But I didn't.

999
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,870
谁
Who?

1000
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,110
25年前  那位总裁还是个分店经理
25 years ago, that CEO was a branch manager.

1001
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,580
阿瑟・克特里奇
Arthur Kitridge.

1002
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,710
你姑姑为他工作过
And your aunt worked for him.

1003
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,180
他把她的生活变成了地狱
And he made her life a living hell.

1004
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,300
因为她是黑人吗
Because she was black?

1005
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,930
因为她是个美人
Because she was beautiful.

1006
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,080
他不断骚扰她
He wouldn't leave her alone.

1007
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,540
最终  她威胁说要告他
Finally, she threatened to do something,

1008
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,680
就被他解雇了
and he fired her.

1009
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,550
而你没有帮她
And you didn't help her.

1010
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,500
当时我只是个刚出道的律师
I was a young attorney.

1011
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,750
接这种案子
Taking on a case like that

1012
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,550
只会让我自己也丢了工作
was only gonna get me fired, too.

1013
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,670
所以我告诉她我们没有办法
So I told her there was nothing we could do.

1014
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,020
那之后
And after that...

1015
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,200
她的生活就分崩离析了
her life fell apart.

1016
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,540
爸爸  你为什么从来没跟我说过
Dad, why didn't you ever tell me any of this before?

1017
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,690
因为几年后
Because she died

1018
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,810
她就去世了  而我一直很羞愧
a few years later, and I was ashamed.

1019
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,800
接着当我看到你未婚夫冒着被解雇的危险
And then I watched your fiancé risk his career

1020
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,900
去帮那些囚犯
to help those prisoners

1021
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,560
我就知道我该做些什么了
and I knew I had to do something.

1022
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,500
你只见过后来的她
You only knew her later.

1023
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,840
如果你认识以前那个
But if you had seen her before,

1024
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,740
聪明  美丽  充满活力的她
smart, beautiful, full of life...

1025
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,530
她的未来本来有无限可能
she could've been anything she wanted.

1026
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,640
像你一样
Just like you.

1027
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,880
我也希望能认识当时的她
I wish I had known her then.

1028
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,690
但是爸爸  我知道一旦你决定做一件事
But Dad, I know that whenever you set your mind to something,

1029
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,530
就没有什么能阻碍你
there is nothing that can stop you.

1030
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,670
所以我建议我们今晚好好整顿
So I say we take the night and we regroup.

1031
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,750
明天早上  我们一定能想到办法
And tomorrow morning, we'll find a way.

1032
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,270
-路易  等等  -不管是什么事
- Louis, wait. - Whatever it is, guys,

1033
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,450
我可以明天做  今天我心情不好
I can deal with it tomorrow. It's been an emotional day.

1034
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,970
很遗憾  必须今天说
Unfortunately, it's not over yet.

1035
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,700
首席检察官
I've been subpoenaed

1036
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,300
给我发了传票
by the Attorney General's office.

1037
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,920
什么  你跟哈维的案子
What are you talking about? You have nothing to do

1038
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,420
-又没关系  -是没有
- with Harvey's case. - She doesn't.

1039
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,310
但他想利用她
But he wants to use her to prove

1040
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,150
证明我以前隐藏过证据
that I've suppressed evidence before

1041
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,410
而我现在正故伎重演
and I'm doing it again.

1042
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,890
-你有过吗  -没有
- Did you? - No.

1043
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,510
路易  他要问我克利福德・丹纳案
Louis, he's gonna question me about the Clifford Danner case

1044
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,510
他会故意把这事说得好像哈维本已知情
and try to make it look like Harvey knew what was going on

1045
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,850
所以我肯定也知道
and so I must've too.

1046
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:28,070
你知道这意味着什么  我需要你帮我准备
You know what that means. I need you to prepare me.

1047
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,320
我不管
I don't care.

1048
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,770
-我做不到  -路易
- I can't. - Louis.

1049
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,160
不行  去找亚历克斯  或者迈克
No. Ask Alex to do it, ask Mike.

1050
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,830
必须是你  你以前也做过
It has to be you, you've done it before.

1051
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,390
所以我才不想再来一次
Which is exactly why I don't wanna do it again.

1052
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,310
-我不想这样对唐娜  -路易
- I'm not doing that to Donna. - Louis.

1053
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,790
你当时跟我说你之所以那么做
Look, you told me you did what you did

1054
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,490
是因为特拉维斯・坦纳不在乎唐娜
because Travis Tanner doesn't give a shit about Donna

1055
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,530
他会尽其所能击溃她
and he was gonna come after her full bore.

1056
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,920
这个人一样冷酷无情
Well, this guy has at least as much of an axe to grind.

1057
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,790
他还和我们一起在检察院公事过
And he worked with us in the D.A.'s office.

1058
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,620
也就是说他了解我们
Which means he knows more about us.

1059
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,490
而保护我的唯一办法  就是你帮我准备好
And the only way to protect me is to prepare me

1060
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,410
怎么应付这场战斗
for what's coming.

1061
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,860
你又要我进行人身攻击
You are asking me to go personal again.

1062
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,980
-我不要  -不  路易
- And I won't do it. - No. Louis,

1063
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,030
我是在要你再次  不择手段地
I am asking you to do whatever you have to do

1064
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,420
保护我
to protect me again.

1065
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,630
而且你这么做不是坏事
And I am telling you it's okay to do it.

1066
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,630
好吧
Okay.

1067
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,350
但是这些都得等明天
But I'm not gonna do anything until tomorrow.

1068
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,760
有一件事必须先办
Because I need to do something first.

1069
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,570
唐娜  你怎么来了
Donna, what are you doing here?

1070
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,080
我准备好告诉你那天
I'm ready to tell you about what happened

1071
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,350
我约会的事了
on my date the other night.

1072
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,920
迈克还在办公室
Well, Mike's still at the office

1073
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,420
家里只有我们两个  说吧
and we've got the place all to ourselves, so...

1074
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,340
你还记得几年前哈维的
Do you remember at Harvey's mock trial

1075
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,110
模拟庭审上  路易问我是不是爱着哈维吗
a couple years ago when Louis asked if I loved Harvey?

1076
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,740
怎么会忘
How could I not?

1077
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,240
他还问到了我上一段认真的恋情
And he also asked me about my last serious boyfriend

1078
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
为何结束
and what broke us up.

1079
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,240
他要求你在他
He asked you to choose

1080
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,860
和哈维之间做选择
between him and Harvey.

1081
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,380
你不愿意
And you wouldn't.

1082
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,650
最近我想起了这个前任
Well, I was thinking about that old boyfriend recently

1083
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,780
于是
and...

1084
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,570
我叫他出来吃了午餐
I called him and we went out to lunch.

1085
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,860
-然后呢  -很棒
- And? - It was wonderful.

1086
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,780
知道他跟我说他结婚了
Until he told me he was married.

1087
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,300
当时接到你的短信时  我正要
And I was about to meet him at a hotel

1088
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,530
去旅馆见他
when I got your text.

1089
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,980
我跟他说我做不到
And I told him I couldn't.

1090
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,040
你怎么不早点告诉我
Why didn't you tell me about any of this earlier?

1091
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,770
我不知道  我想也许是我在自责
I don't know. I guess maybe I was judging myself

1092
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,040
我害怕你也会指责我
and I was afraid that you were gonna judge me, too.

1093
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,060
-我不会的  -我知道
- I would never do that. - I know.

1094
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,230
但有时候拒绝别人的关心
But sometimes it's just easier to push away the people

1095
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,590
比实话实说要容易
who care about you than tell them the real story.

1096
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,630
好吧
Well,

1097
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,180
不管你怎么推开我
you can push me away as much as you want.

1098
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,120
我都不会抛弃你的
I'll still be here.

1099
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,550
你后悔吗
Do you regret it?

1100
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,760
后悔什么
Regret what?

1101
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,360
把哈维置于这个人之上
Putting Harvey over this guy.

1102
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:00,320
我想我后悔的  也许是把哈维置于我自己之上
I think maybe I regret putting Harvey over myself.

1103
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,510
路易  半夜十一点  你怎么来了
Louis, what are you doing here? 11:00 P.M. 

1104
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,160
我来是因为我知道你晚上要照顾他
I came because I knew you were taking the night shift

1105
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,660
但你昨晚都没有睡觉
and since you stayed up all last night,

1106
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,860
所以我想也许你需要点帮助
I thought you might need a little relief.

1107
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,340
真的吗
Are you sure?

1108
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,690
真的  虽然前半个小时
I am. Though I may need a little help

1109
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,920
可能还需要你指导
with the first half hour.

1110
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,350
不用吧  我觉得你天生就会
I don't know, you look like a natural to me.

1111
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,300
-要抱抱他吗  -好
- You wanna take him? - Yeah.

1112
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,080
好的
Okay.

1113
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,250
-托住他的头  -头  好的
- Oh, get his head. - His head, okay.

1114
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,670
-头要托稳  -好的
- You gotta support his head. - There we go.

1115
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,390
奥斯汀  这是路易
Austin, I'd like you to meet Louis.

1116
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,790
奥斯汀  很高兴认识你
Austin, it's so nice to meet you.

1117
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,010
快请进
Hey, come in.

1118
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,670
你真的觉得我天生就会吗
Do you really think I'm gonna be a natural?

1119
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,070
当然
Yeah, absolutely.

1120
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,240
现在做什么
Oh, what do I do?

1121
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,610
我不管了  我睡了
I don't care. I'm going to sleep.

1122
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,950
不行不行  我不知道该做什么
Oh, no, no, no, no. What do I do?

1123
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:00,820
谢啦
Thank you.

1124
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,820
不会有事的
It's gonna be okay.

1125
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,230
不会有事的
It's gonna be okay.

1126
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,300
你好  我叫路易
Hello. I'm Louis.
