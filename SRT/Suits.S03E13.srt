00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,390
《訴訟雙雄》前情提要

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,710
我想跟你一起工作  來皮爾遜-斯佩克特
I want to work with you. Come to Pearson Specter.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,930
如果你只是想跟我一起工作
If all you want to do is work with me,

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,480
我可以在別的地方找工作
I can find a job somewhere else.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,350
斯科特  我想要的不止這些
Scottie, that's not all I want.

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,160
-那就說出來  -我希望我的生命中有你
- Then say it. - I want you in my life.

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,700
結束了  邁克  我盯上你了
It's over, Mike. I'm onto you.

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,270
我要揭露你
And I'm going to expose you

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,540
撒謊卑賤的真面目
for the lying piece of filth that you are.

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,900
路易  我上過哈佛的
Louis, I went to Harvard.

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,400
我只是改了我的成績
I just changed my grade.

12
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,430
你作弊了
You cheated,

13
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,090
而如今你又指望我幫你逃過一劫
and now you're looking at me to help you get away with it.

14
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,500
-不是的  路易  -滾出我的視線
- No, Louis-- - Get out of my sight.

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,240
路易  他這么做是為了能從事
Louis, he did it so that he can practice

16
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,920
我們都熱愛的事業
the thing that we all love.

17
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,310
假如你不放過他的話
And if you don't let it go,

18
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,380
他就再也不能從事這個了
he's never gonna be able to practice it again.

19
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,540
你讓邁克坦白真相
You make Mike confess,

20
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,320
無異于將他的人生徹底毀掉
you might as well throw his life down the toilet.

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,660
你說過我們是朋友
You said we're friends.

22
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,660
朋友是永遠不會要求我這樣做的
A friend would not ask me to do this.

23
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,940
是不會  路易
No, Louis.

24
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,470
作為朋友  如果你不這樣做
A friend just won't hold it against you

25
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,520
我也不會怪罪你
if you don't.

26
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,450
你這一大早的上哪去了
Where did you race off to so quickly this morning?

27
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,970
我去見小情人了
I went to see my mistress.

28
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,160
她姓甚名誰
Mm-hmm, and what's her name?

29
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,350
重罪
Felony.

30
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,250
是嗎
Really?

31
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,310
如果我跟你說同樣的話你有什么感覺
And how would you feel if I said the same thing to you?

32
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,420
那得看了  她性感嗎
It depends. Is she hot?

33
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,240
你知道
Mm-hmm, you realize

34
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,910
你這是在作死吧
you're just digging yourself in deeper now, don't you?

35
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,220
那幸好我出門是為了送你
Well, then it's good that I was really out getting you...

36
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,860
這個
this.

37
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,510
米妮鼠
Minnie Mouse.

38
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,330
我從你爸那兒拿的照片
I got a copy from your dad.

39
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,010
應該可以和這幅大熊貓搭配上
I thought it would complement panda.

40
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,020
太棒了
It's perfect.

41
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,300
那就好  我重獲新生了
Good, because I have a new lease on life.

42
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,950
如果沒有你  我就沒這個機會
And I wouldn't if it weren't for you.

43
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,450
不止我一個人
I am not the only one

44
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,610
幫忙說服路易放過你
who helped convince Louis to let it go.

45
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,700
我知道
I know.

46
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,240
那你要送哈維什么嗎
So are you gonna get something for Harvey?

47
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,310
我也想  但他什么都不缺
I want to, but what do you get

48
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,670
能送他什么
the man who has everything?

49
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,090
你送我的東西
The same thing you got me.

50
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,150
一張他扮成米老鼠的照片嗎
A picture of him dressed as a mouse?

51
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,800
不是
No.

52
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,650
金錢買不到的東西
Something money can't buy.

53
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,150
你要什么
What do you need?

54
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,910
-建議  -這條領帶真得換了
- Advice. - That tie has got to go.

55
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,110
我都忍住沒說好幾個月了
I've been wanting to say something for months.

56
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,980
不是領帶的事  對吧
It's not about the tie, is it?

57
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,190
你知道不是領帶的事
You know it's not about the tie.

58
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,430
你就想耍耍我
You're just giving me shit.

59
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,830
自己送上門的機會必須把握住啊
We take our opportunities where they present themselves.

60
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,930
好了  唐娜能為您做什么呢
Now what can Donna do for you?

61
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,540
-我需要完美的禮物  -送誰
- I need the perfect gift. - Who is it?

62
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,480
瑞秋嗎  要私人一點
Rachel? Something personal,

63
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,460
最好是從她爸那兒拿一張照片
preferably a picture from her father.

64
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,620
你怎么會...
How could you possibly--

65
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,200
送杰西卡就要簡單優雅
Jessica? Simple and elegant.

66
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,360
或者狂野瘋狂  你自己選吧
Or wild and crazy, the choice is yours.

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,100
路易的話  無所謂啦
Louis? Oh, God, doesn't matter.

68
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,890
隨便送什么  他都會哭上好幾天
Just get him anything. He'll cry for days.

69
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,320
那哈維呢
What about Harvey?

70
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,480
沒有禮物適合送哈維
There is no gift for Harvey.

71
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,210
他想要的  都會得到
He gets what he wants,

72
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,770
沒得到的  就是不想要
and he doesn't want what he doesn't get.

73
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,530
這個認識  就是我能送給他的唯一禮物
And my knowing that is the only gift he'll ever need from me.

74
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,730
唐娜  我來這兒以后
Donna, ever since I've been here,

75
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,740
每天早晨走出那部電梯時都在想
every morning, I step off that elevator wondering

76
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,380
今天會不會是我在這兒的最后一天
if this is going to be my last day.

77
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,820
上周  那一天來臨了
Last week, that day came,

78
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,540
而哈維說"今天不行"
and Harvey said, "Not today."

79
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,580
我...
I...

80
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,660
我需要送他點什么
I just--I need to get him something

81
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,760
好讓他知道這件事對我有多大意義
to let him know what that means to me.

82
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,110
-好吧  -怎么樣
- Okay. - What?

83
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,600
有這么一樣東西  哈維朝思暮想了很多年
There is one thing that Harvey has been wanting to get

84
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,780
都沒能得到
for years, and he hasn't been able to.

85
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,560
-是什么  -不行  太私人了
- What is it? - No, it's too personal.

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,820
而且連他都得不到  
And I don't see how you're going to be able

87
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,590
你怎么會有本事弄到
to make it happen when he couldn't.

88
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,570
不管是什么  這一定是完美禮物
Whatever it is, it'll make the perfect gift.

89
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,730
首先
Before we do anything else,

90
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,620
我想正式歡迎我們最新的資深合伙人
I'd like to officially welcome our newest senior partner,

91
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,920
達娜·斯科特
Dana Scott.

92
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,780
謝謝大家讓我入伙
I'd like to thank you all for bringing me in.

93
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,290
我保證  我會積極做到最好
And I assure you, I will be hitting the ground running.

94
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,910
這話我愛聽
Well, that's what we like to hear.

95
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,250
哈維  弗蘭克林·科利爾的案子怎么樣
Harvey, where do we stand on Franklin Courier?

96
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,210
他們周五剛宣布了收購計劃
They just announced plans for the acquisition Friday.

97
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,350
我想負責這件案子
I'd like to take lead on this one.

98
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,200
看來你的確很積極啊
I guess the ground has been hit.

99
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,730
給你了
It's yours.

100
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,250
非常抱歉
Shit. I am so sorry.

101
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,710
我剛在洛根出了點意外
I had an incident at Logan.

102
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,220
-錯過什么了嗎  -沒有
- Did I miss anything? - Not really.

103
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,850
弗蘭克林收購案會交給斯科特負責
Scottie's going to be handling the Franklin acquisition.

104
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,200
你在說笑吧
You're kidding, right?

105
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,310
弗蘭克林是我的客戶  我就遲到了五分鐘
Franklin's my client. I was five minutes late.

106
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,790
事實上  是十分鐘
Ten minutes, actually.

107
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,120
我不管我是不是
Well, I don't care if I skipped

108
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,840
翹掉了整場會議去全身脫毛了
the whole goddamn meeting to get a full-body wax.

109
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,520
那家公司還是無名小卒的時就是我談下的
I landed that company when they were a regional shithole,

110
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,100
我可不需要誰來插足...
and I don't need some interloper to--

111
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,390
斯科特現在是資深合伙人了  路易
Scottie's a senior partner, Louis.

112
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,190
扯淡呢
Oh, this is bullshit.

113
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,790
你的意思是規章制度也是扯淡了
Then I guess you're saying the bylaws are bullshit.

114
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,380
我的規章制度簡直是藝術
My bylaws are a work of art.

115
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,260
我知道
I know.

116
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,330
規章制度寫明如果資深合伙人
And the bylaws clearly state that if a senior partner

117
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,060
開會遲到十分鐘以上
is more than ten minutes late to a meeting,

118
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,780
就無權發言了
he or she has no standing.

119
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,390
這條規定沒有考慮到
Well, that rule doesn't take into consideration

120
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,470
合伙人是因為不可控因素才遲到的
a partner being late due to reasons beyond his control.

121
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,140
不好意思
Wait. I'm sorry.

122
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,780
"這條規定在任何情況下都不得縮減
"This rule shall not be abridged by any circumstance,

123
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,530
包括但不限于家人生病
"including but not limited to family illness,

124
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,220
刑事拘留和行程延誤
"criminal detention, and travel delay.

125
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,780
因為沒有守時  我們與動物無異"  對吧
For without punctuality, we are animals," Right?

126
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,580
你竟敢對我引用我自己的話  這事沒完
How dare you quote me to me? This isn't over.

127
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,030
到此為止了
Yes, it is.

128
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,770
他們仍舊是你的客戶  路易
They're still your client, Louis,

129
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,540
但這個收購案由斯科特負責了
but it's Scottie's transaction.

130
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,200
繼續
Moving on.

131
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,450
這是什么
What's this?

132
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,180
這是你能收到的最棒的禮物
Oh, it's only the greatest gift you've ever received.

133
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,070
比喬丹狂砍凱爾特人63分那場
Better than M.J.'s jersey

134
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,950
穿的球衣還棒嗎
from the 63-point game?

135
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,610
如果這個文件夾當時也上場了
If this folder had played in that game,

136
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,700
那它一定能砍下80分
it would have scored 80 points.

137
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,970
我都不知道這話什么意思
Okay, I don't even know what that means.

138
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,690
我也不知道  你打開就是了
Neither do I. Just open it.

139
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,970
一件普通公司的案子
A run-of-the-mill corporate case.

140
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,530
我不明白
I don't get it.

141
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,970
快看另一面的代表律師是誰
Just look at the attorney of record on the other side.

142
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,240
A.艾略特·斯坦普爾
A. Eliot Stemple.

143
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,960
你怎么知道的
How did you know?

144
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,560
我問了唐娜  她把一切都告訴我了
I talked to Donna. She told me everything.

145
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,470
-什么叫"一切"  -我不知道
- Define "everything." - Oh, I don't know.

146
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,760
你們在哈佛時
He kicked your ass in moot court

147
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,770
他連續三年在模擬法庭擊敗了你
three years running at Harvard.

148
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,910
你很不爽  夜不能寐
You're kind of upset about it. It keeps you up at night.

149
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,920
如果她把一切都告訴你了
Yeah, well, if she told you everything,

150
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,770
你就該知道過去十年他一直躲著我
you'd know he's been ducking me for the past ten years.

151
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,610
哈維  我剛說了
Harvey, I just told you

152
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,480
這份禮物比喬丹的球衣更棒
this gift is better than M.J.'s jersey.

153
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,780
如果我履行不了
Do you think I'd make that kind of claim

154
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,180
又怎么會說呢
if I couldn't deliver on it?

155
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,240
你什么意思
What are you saying?

156
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,400
我的意思是
I'm saying

157
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
A.艾略特·斯坦普爾今天躲不開你了
that A. Eliot Stemple is not ducking you today.

路易  如果是弗蘭克林·科利爾的事
Louis, if this is about Franklin Courier,

168
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,130
我已經決定了
I've made my decision.

169
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,150
-不是  -好
- It's not. - Okay.

170
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,010
那是什么事
Then what's this about?

171
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,330
-弗蘭克林·科利爾  -路易
- It's about Franklin Courier. - Louis.

172
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,830
杰西卡  我要知道我為什么被排在了
Jessica, I want to know where I fall in the pecking order

173
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,130
-達娜·斯科特后面  -公司沒有排名
- with regard to Dana Scott. - There is no pecking order.

174
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,070
-我不是那么做事的  -好啊
- I don't look at things that way. - Great.

175
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,510
那我被排在她后面是因為她在跟哈維上床
That means I'm behind her because she's banging Harvey.

176
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,530
我會裝作沒聽到你這句話
I'm going to pretend I didn't just hear that.

177
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,230
不幸的是
Well, unfortunately,

178
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,930
我不能裝作你剛剛沒有替你
I can't pretend that you didn't just screw me over

179
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,530
合伙人的女朋友而坑我
on behalf of your partner's girlfriend.

180
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,730
路易  我沒坑你
Louis, I didn't screw you over.

181
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,530
是你自己的章程坑了你
Your own bylaws did.

182
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,090
如果你倆交換位置
And if the shoe were on the other foot

183
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,640
你奪走了她的案子
and you'd taken the case from her,

184
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,530
你絕不會有任何良心不安
you'd be sleeping like a baby.

185
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,840
那又如何
What does that have to do with anything?

186
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,510
好吧  不用回答了
All right, you know what, don't bother answering that question.

187
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,860
對我而言  達娜·斯科特死定了
As far as I'm concerned, Dana Scott is dead to me.

188
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,580
路易
Louis...

189
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,550
你有沒有想過  這些局面
Did it ever occur to you that these situations

190
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,050
或許是你自己造成的
may sometimes be a result of your own doing?

191
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,700
你在說什么啊
What on God's green Earth are you talking about?

192
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,280
你有機會跟新來的高級合伙人成為朋友
You have an opportunity to bond with our newest senior partner

193
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,370
或者永遠跟她交惡
or make a permanent enemy of her.

194
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,380
我要說的是  過去
And I'm saying, in the past,

195
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,830
你一般都選擇了與人交惡的那條路
you've generally chosen the enemy route.

196
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,980
舉個例子
Can you give me a specific?

197
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,910
立刻能想到的嗎
Off the top of my head?

198

潘伯頓  耶茨  科恩  達夫納  拉米爾茲
Pemberton, Yates, Cohen, Duffner, Ramirez...

羅賓森  詹金斯  加德納
Robinson, Jenkins, Gardner.

201
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,630
好吧  你想說什么
Okay, okay, fine. What's your point?

202
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,870
我想說  如果這事你不去糾結
My point is, if you let this thing go,

203
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,440
你能徹底改變
you can change the entire course

204
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,260
你跟斯科特的關系
of your relationship with Scottie...

205
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,930
誰知道呢
And who knows,

206
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,060
或許能重新定位你在公司中的形象
maybe even redefine yourself within the firm.

207
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,350
人生箴言啊
Words to live by.

208
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,790
杰西卡  你可能就此改變了我人生的前景
Jessica, you may have just changed my entire outlook on life.

209
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,830
-是炸彈嗎  -是禮物
- Is that a bomb? - it's a gift.

210
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,040
今早的事之后  你還要送我禮物
You're giving me a gift after what happened this morning?

211
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,300
是啊
You're right.

212
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,130
你的確靠咬文嚼字偷走了我的客戶
You did poach my client on a technicality.

213
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,580
更糟的是
And worse than that,

214
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,070
你還利用我的話來堵我的嘴
you used my own precious words against me,

215
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,090
一般來說  我會向你宣戰  但是...
and normally, I'd declare war, but--

216
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:24,670
什么
But what?

217
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,600
有人向我指出  我有些不良傾向
It's been pointed out to me that I have certain proclivities

218
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,690
應該做下調整
that need to be adjusted.

219
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,840
路易  你到底要干什么
Louis, what are you saying?

220
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,310
我是想跟你做朋友
I'm saying I would like us to be friends.

221
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,870
真貼心
It's very sweet.

222
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,800
-謝謝  -謝謝
- Thank you. - Thank you.

223
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,040
-我們是朋友了嗎  -嗯
- So we're friends? - Friends.

224
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,670
很好  把我的案子還我
Great. Give me my files back.

225
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,580
什么
Excuse me?

226
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,130
你接受了我的友誼  還我的案子
You accepted my friendship. Give me back my case.

227
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,220
抱歉  路易  但這是不行的
Uh, sorry, Louis. That's not how it works.

228
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,590
你算哪門子的朋友啊
What the hell kind of friend are you?

229
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,020
我是不會接受你一條圍巾就
I'm a friend who is not going to give you my case

230
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,840
把案子還給你的朋友
14 seconds after you give me a scarf.

231
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,830
那可不是一條圍巾
No, no, no, it's not a scarf.

232
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,260
那是世界上最好的披肩
It's one of the world's finest pashminas.

233
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,230
就算是唯一一件我也不管
I don't care if it's the world's only pashmina.

234
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,120
案子不能給你
You're not getting this case.

235
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,190
那我沒別的辦法了
Well, then you leave me no choice

236
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,520
只能執行第19.5條B款
but to institute article 19.5/B.

237
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,560
沒有那么一條
There is no article 19.5/B.

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,020
現在有了
There is now.

239

by the existing attorney of record.

241
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,320
你個混蛋
You son of a bitch.

242
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,470
-你就是想找茬  -什么
- You just want to start a fight. - Excuse me?

243
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,780
我想跟你交朋友的
I tried to make friends with you,

244
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,930
你卻讓我去死
and you just told me to go screw myself.

245
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,080
我警告你  路易
I am warning you, Louis.

246
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,820
你不會想跟我斗的
This is a fight you do not want.

247
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,990
不  我想  而且我會贏
Oh, no, I want it, and I'm gonna win it.

248
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,290
到時候  你可別找你男朋友哭去
And when I do, you better not go crying to your boyfriend.

249
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,190
瞧瞧這是誰
Well, look who it is,

羅斯福來電話了
F.D.R. called.

255
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,210
他想要回他的領結
He wants his bowtie back.

256
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,870
如果你以前也能這么厲害
Oh, if you'd had rebuttals like that,

257
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,420
或許在模擬法庭上就能斗過我一次了
maybe you would've gotten past me in moot court just once.

258
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,000
相信我  阿奇伯德  我早就不在乎你了
Trust me, Archibald, I'm way past you.

259

- I knew back at Harvard? - Oh, him?

263
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,150
他在一家比你的公司大十倍的律所
He's a name partner at a firm

264
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,590
做冠名合伙人
ten times bigger than yours.

265
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,000
這么在意大小  看來是想彌補
Bigger? Sounds like somebody's trying to compensate

266
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,850
那三場慘敗
for three huge losses.

267
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,910
或者是生活在過去的人不敢
Or somebody's living in the past and too afraid

268
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,380
跟我在現在對壘
to take me on in the present.

281
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,190
我忘記在訴狀上寫我們律所的名字了嗎
Did I forget to put the name of my firm on the complaint?

因為他是個膽小鬼
On the grounds that he's a pussy.

288
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,710
-你說什么  斯佩克特先生  -我只是不知
- What's that, Mr. Specter? - I was just wondering

289
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,030
他的動議是否打印出來了  我們沒拿到啊
if he has a copy of his motion, because we never got one.

290
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,370
我沒拿  法官大人  臨時有事
Not with me, Your Honor. Something suddenly came up.

291
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,540
我侄女病了
My niece, she took ill.

292
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,230
如果家人生病  你當然該前去照料
Well, when your family's sick, you have to tend to them.

但我們有他的家譜
but we do have a copy of his family tree.

295
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,700
他沒有侄女
He has no nieces.

296
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,970
我不是真指侄女
I meant "niece" figuratively.

297
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,970
她其實是我的教女
She is actually my goddaughter.

298
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,810
她叫什么
And what exactly is her name?

299
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,420
桑德拉·希爾威斯汀
Sandra Silverstein.

300
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,770
法官大人  在過去五年里
Your Honor, that's the same fictitious goddaughter

301
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,700
每逢斯坦普爾先生需要訴訟延期
that's taken ill every time Mr. Stemple's needed a continuance

302
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,850
這個虛假的教女就會生病
in the last five years.

303
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,440
看來病得不輕啊
Sounds serious.

304
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,930
試過針灸嗎
Have you tried acupuncture?

305
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,490
他們太過分了  法官大人
They are completely out of line, Your Honor.

306
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,850
過分的是你
The only thing out of line is you.

307
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,960
斯坦普爾先生  你不僅不可以換下自己
Mr. Stemple, not only will you not be replacing yourself,

308
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,070
你還要向法庭交兩千塊罰款
you'll be paying the court a $2,000 fine.

309
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,460
關住他了  囚籠搏擊比賽開始
We got him. The cage match is on.

310
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,670
兩人進  一人出
Two men enter, one man leaves.

311
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,380
我們現在還什么都沒有呢
We don't have anything yet.

312
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,150
什么
What?

313
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,530
得了  你還要我替你作戰嗎
Come on, you need me to try this thing for you too?

314
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,150
聽好了  這可不是雷霆穹頂的表演
Listen to me. This isn't Thunder Dome.

315
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,620
你要去把他離開法學院后的每件案子都看一遍
I need you to look at every case he's worked since law school.

316
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,090
放心  哈維  我會搞定的
Relax, Harvey. I'm all over it.

317
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,230
那最好  因為你不了解他
You better be, because you don't know this guy.

318
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,550
我告訴你  一旦他明白
I'm telling you, once it sinks in

319
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,020
這次他逃不掉了
that there's no way out of that cage,

320
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,930
他就會全力出擊的
he's gonna come out swinging.

321
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,150
你白跑一趟  哈維今晚沒來
You wasted a trip. Harvey's gone for the night.

322
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,470
我不是來找哈維的  我是來找你的
I'm not here to see Harvey. I'm here to see you.

323
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,200
拜托了  我要說的話很重要
Please, what I have to say is important.

324
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
我對你要說什么沒興趣
I'm not interested in what you have to say.

325
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,150
上法學院時  我一無所有
In law school, I had nothing.

326
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,800
什么都沒有
Nothing.

327
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,970
沒有朋友  女朋友  不被人放在眼里
No friends, no girlfriend, no respect.

328
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,820
事實上  我的成績也只是勉強畢業
The truth is, I was hanging onto not flunking out by a thread.

329
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,480
看著我  我仍未婚
Look at me. I'm not married.

330
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,850
沒有孩子  事業根本不成功
I don't have children. I'm not particularly successful.

331
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,630
你為什么要告訴我這些
Why are you telling me this?

332
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,890
我有自己要堅持的小驕傲
I have a little piece of glory that I've been holding on to,

333
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,480
我不認為哈維會在意
and I don't expect Harvey to care about that.

334
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,220
但第一律師仍是你
But you're still first chair.

335
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,320
你仍能放我一馬
You can still let me out.

336
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,170
而且我想你應該會答應
And I thought that maybe you would.

337
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,990
我會考慮下的
I'll think about it.

338
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,600
那樣就夠了
That's all I can ask for.

339
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,820
除了一件事
Except for one thing.

340
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,900
這跟你的原告告訴哈維的話一字不差
That's the exact same speech that your plaintiff gave Harvey,

341
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,140
在第一年的時候
year one.

342
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,100
但這并不意味我說了假話
Doesn't mean it isn't true.

343
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,050
你認為我會讓你這樣玩弄我嗎
You think I'm gonna let you play me?

344
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,060
試試總沒壞處
A man can try.

345
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,900
斯坦普爾  這么長時間你一直躲著哈維
Stemple, you've been ducking Harvey long enough.

346
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,550
現在你要么打贏  要么就輸掉官司
Now you're either gonna win, or you're gonna lose.

347
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,200
你這次絕對躲不掉他
What you're not gonna do is avoid him anymore.

348
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,700
你忘了件事
Oh, and you forgot.

349
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,810
我查過你的家譜
I looked up your family tree.

350
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,620
你已經結婚了  還有孩子
You are married, you do have children,

351
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,430
你的事務所是業內一流的
and your firm is top tier.

352
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,830
拜托  我討厭我老婆  孩子就是拖累
Please, I hate my wife, my children are anchors,

353
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,610
我留在那個事務所的唯一原因
and the only reason I stay at that firm

354
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,960
就是付錢給他們讓他們別管我
is to pay for them to leave me alone.

355
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,670
滾進電梯吧  斯坦普爾
Get the hell on the elevator, stemple.

356
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,380
我可不想讓你待在我們辦公室
I'm not leaving you in our office.

357
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,770
好主意
Good call.

358
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,590
艾略特·斯坦普爾  舊相識了啊
Eliot Stemple, that's a blast from the past.

359
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,130
當他意識到這次躲不掉我時
You should have seen his smug face

360
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,910
你真應該看看他那張自以為是的臉
when he realized he couldn't duck me.

361
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,830
需要我幫忙嗎
Need my help?

362
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,350
不用  這案子我要靠自己
No, I am taking this one all for myself.

363
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,590
哈維  已經三次了
Harvey, it was three times.

364
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,110
還記得它對你造成了什么影響嗎
You remember what it did to you?

365
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,950
對  我記得
Yeah, I remember.

366
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,090
但別老想著在我不需要幫忙的事上幫我
But instead of offering help where it isn't needed,

367
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,870
你應該把精力集中在路易·利特身上
you should be focused on Louis Litt.

368
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,600
你在會議上那樣對待他之后
After what you did at that meeting,

369
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,470
他會竭盡所能地對付你
he's going to come at you full-bore.

370
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,450
我就是要那么做
I wouldn't have it any other way.

371
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,780
你故意挑起了跟他的爭斗
You picked a fight with him on purpose.

372
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,640
確實如此
Of course I did.

373
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,750
那你說"要坦誠待人"
What happened to the whole

374
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,550
又是怎么一回事
"We need to be open and honest" thing?

375
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,470
我覺得在這么淺顯易懂的問題上
I didn't think we needed to be open and honest

376
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,030
我們不需要對對方坦誠
that one plus one equals two.

377
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,160
我明白了
I get it.

378
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,850
你不希望被大家看做是我的女朋友
You don't want to be seen as my girlfriend,

379
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,110
所以你選擇挑戰所有人中
so you picked a fight with the biggest,

380
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,500
你挑了最兇最猛的對手
baddest prisoner in the yard.

381
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,630
如果我贏了
I win this,

382
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:56,870
人人影視
YYeTs.com

383
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,990
我就是勝過路易·利特的合伙人
I'm the partner that beat Louis Litt,

384
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,260
而不是跟哈維·斯佩克特上床的合伙人
not the partner sleeping with Harvey Specter.

385
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,870
好吧  我尊重你的選擇
Okay, I respect that.

386
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,910
但路易剛幫過我一個大忙
But Louis just did me a huge favor,

387
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,430
我不想夾在你們中間為難
and I don't want to get caught in the middle of it.

388
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,800
我不需要你夾在中間
I don't need you in the middle of it.

389
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,160
很好
Good.

390
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,830
不過
Although...

391
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,220
你做了什么
What did you do?

392
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,470
實際上不是我做了什么
Well, it's not really what I did.

393
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,090
是你做了什么
It's, um... what you did.

394
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,900
我做了什么
what did I do?

395
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,850
路易  你在這干什么
Louis, what are you doing here?

396
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,350
昨晚我收到你的郵件了
Hey, I got your email last night.

397
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,200
-對  關于那個  -沒事  沒事
- Yeah, about that--  - No, no, no.

398
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,320
收到郵件我很開心
I was happy to get it,

399
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,190
也很開心能做那些工作
happy to do the work.

400
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,100
沒有比熬一整夜
Nothing makes me happier

401
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,260
幫助我的朋友更讓我高興的事了
than to spend all night helping out a friend.

402
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,200
你整晚都沒睡嗎
You were up all night?

403
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,010
4:30到4:45之間打了個盹
Caught a power nap between 4:30 and 4:45.

404
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,250
我沒事
I'll be fine.

405
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,400
你都查到什么了
Well, what'd you come up with?

406
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,280
按照你的指示
Per your instructions,

407
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,560
我仔細地查看了
I went through eight years

408
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,770
普理查德控股公司
of Pritchard Holdings corporate returns

409
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,230
八年來的財政報表
with a fine-tooth comb.

410
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,290
這時間跨度可真不小啊
That's a remarkably long time frame.

411
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,080
對  你讓我查四年  我給你八年的結果
Yeah, you ask for four, I give you eight.

412
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,140
我就是這么做事的
It's what I do.

413
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,210
而且我找出了每一處錯誤
And I caught every mistake there was to find.

414
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,550
很好  把修正后的報表交上去
Great. File the amended returns.

415
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,450
走運的話
With any luck,

416
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,620
詹納制藥公司會一敗涂地的
Jenner Pharmaceuticals will be none the wiser.

417
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,140
詹納制藥公司
Jenner Pharmaceuticals?

418
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,580
這案子是起訴米勒貨運的
This suit's against Miller Trucking.

419
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,520
我之前說錯了  是米勒貨運
That's what I meant, Miller Trucking.

420
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,580
他們是因為什么被起訴的
What are they suing them for?

421
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,160
貨運
Trucking?

422
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,680
媽的
God damn it.

423
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,850
你給我發那封郵件就是為給我添亂的
You sent that email just to screw with me.

424
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,040
路易  那郵件不是我發的
Louis, I didn't send the email.

425
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,960
是斯科特發的
Scottie did.

426
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,640
她用了我的電腦  我完全不知情
She used my computer. I didn't even know.

427
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,190
騙人  她跑來找你幫忙
Oh, bullsh. She came running to you.

428
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,230
你利用了我們的友誼
You played on our friendship.

429
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,680
而現在你還讓我自說自話
And just now you had me go on about it

430
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,870
繼續看我的笑話
to continue the mockery.

431
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,270
我沒在看你的笑話
Look, I wasn't mocking you.

432
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,350
我只是不想讓你發現事情真相
I was trying to keep you from finding out.

433
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,430
我以為如果你沒發現
I thought if you didn't know,

434
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,680
就不會受到傷害
no harm would be done.

435
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,930
不  你知道嗎  傷害已經造成了
No, you know what, harm was done.

436
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,740
如果你還珍惜這段友誼的話
And if you value this friendship at all,

437
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,180
你就別插手
you would stay out of it,

438
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,750
因為我將針對達娜·斯科特
because I'm going to the mattresses

439
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,010
發起一場戰爭
against Dana Scott.

440
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,380
戰爭[也指床墊]
Mattresses?

441
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,880
你在看《教父》嗎
Have you been watching the Godfather?

442
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,790
對  我一直想找出些共同點
Yeah, I've been trying to come up with some common ground

443
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,630
來加深我們的友誼  不服告我啊
to expand our friendship-- sue me.

444
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,140
告訴我你已經把給富蘭克林·庫里耶的
Tell me you finished the proposal

445
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,410
提案寫好了
for Franklin Courier.

446
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,670
沒有
No.

447
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,620
你說沒有什么意思
What do you mean, no?

448
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,180
我是說我根本沒開始寫
I mean I didn't do it.

449
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,150
什么  你老媽去世了嗎
What, did your mother die?

450
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,130
因為如果她還活著  你知道
Because if she didn't, you know--

451
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,810
路易  是你告訴我不用寫了
Louis, you told me not to.

452
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,150
我們正處于戰爭狀態  班尼特
We're at war, Bennett.

453
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,820
我為什么要那么做
Why would I do that?

454
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,100
我不知道  但你給我留了張紙條
I don't know, but I got a note from you

455
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,690
告訴我你要做個高風亮節的人
telling me that you were gonna be the bigger person

456
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,000
讓達娜·斯科特來處理這個案子
and let Dana Scott handle it.

457
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:05,770
高風亮節的人
The bigger person?

458
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,420
你應該能猜到那不是我寫的
You should've known that was not from me.

459
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,170
早上好  路易  今天天氣不錯
Good morning, Louis. Great day.

460
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,490
你看起來有點疲倦啊
Oh, you look a little tired.

461
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,560
我不累  永遠感覺不到累
I'm not tired. I don't get tired.

462
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,730
-你想要什么  達娜  -想把這個給你
- What do you want, dana? - I'm just dropping this by.

463
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,850
你把提案發給富蘭克林了
You sent Franklin a proposal?

464
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,260
你不在場我沒法跟他們見面
Well, I couldn't meet them without you,

465
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,630
所有我想直接把這個發給他們算了
So I figured that I would send this over instead.

466
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,260
你背著我們寫了這個
You did this behind our backs.

467
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,010
我不喜歡背著別人辦事
I don't believe in doing things behind people's backs.

468
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,860
所以我把那封郵件抄送給你們倆個了
That's why I C.C.'d you both on this letter.

469
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,010
不  你抄送給我們
No, you C.C.'d us,

470
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,270
這樣他們就能知道是你發出來的
so they'd know that it came from you,

471
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,210
而與我們毫無關系
and we had nothing to do with it.

472
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:30,970
郵件確實是我發的
It did come from me,

473
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,570
而你們也確實根本沒出力
and you did have nothing to do with it.

474
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,690
好吧  你想這么玩嗎  沒問題
Yeah, you want to play it this way, fine.

475
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,220
但如果你認為自己能打敗我
But if you think you can outsmart me,

476
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,140
-那你得給利才行  -超級給利
- You're gonna get Litt up. - Litt the hell up.

477
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,580
給利
Litt up?

478
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,730
利特
Litt. Oh.

479
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,680
老天  這個好可愛
Oh, my God, that is so cute.

480
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,550
我一定要在臉書上記下來這個梗
I'm gonna go make fun of it on my Facebook page right now.

481
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,510
謝謝你們
Thank you.

482
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,280
這樣吧  我們要一步步奪回這個案子
Okay, we're gonna take this thing apart limb by limb

483
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,320
而胡說小姐會希望
so that little Miss Bullshit

484
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,650
她從來沒聽過路易·利特這個名字
wished she'd never heard the name Louis Litt.

485
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,510
路易  她是位優秀的律師
Louis, she's an excellent attorney.

486
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,880
如果我們找不到把柄呢
What if we can't find anything wrong with it?

487
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,500
我們不需要找到把柄
We're not gonna find anything wrong with it.

488
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,460
所以我們才要分而治之
That's why we're gonna take it apart,

489
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,970
創造出所謂的把柄
to make something wrong with it.

490
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,040
沃克先生  去年十月
Mr. Walker, in October of last year,

491
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,070
您曾與京都電腦公司的董事長進行過接洽
you made a pitch to the chairman of Kyoto Computers.

492
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,170
那次接洽怎么樣
How did that pitch go?

493
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,250
非常愉快
It went amazingly,

494
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,740
直到他們告訴我們
right up until when they told us

495
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,830
他們不可能購買我們的產品
there was no way they could actually buy our product.

496
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,870
為什么呢
And why was that?

497
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,090
因為亞努什威脅說  
Because Janus threatened to

498
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,380
如果他們與我們有任何交易
withhold their microchip

499
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,500
亞努什將不再提供任何微芯片
if Kyoto did even $1 worth of business with us.

500
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,680
而我們家鄰居說
And my next-door neighbor says

501
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,930
他看到他老婆與鄰居偷情
he saw his next-door neighbor cheating on his wife.

502
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,770
而這只是個報復性的謊言
Turned out to be nothing but a vindictive lie.

503
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,800
這是京都公司執行總裁格里芬和霍蘭德
These are sworn affidavits from the CEOs of Kyoto, Griffon,

504
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,290
簽署的宣誓書  證詞與沃克先生一致
and Howland all backing up Mr. Walker's claim.

505
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,860
他們可不是你的鄰居  阿奇伯德
This isn't your next-door neighbor, Archibald.

506
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,060
沃克先生  我們占據市場支配地位
Mr. Walker, the truth is that we control the market

507
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,870
因為我們的產品質量比你們好  不是嗎
because our product is better than yours, isn't it?

508
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,330
不  不是的
No, it isn't.

509
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,240
得了吧  杰克  攝像頭開著呢
Jake, come on. The cameras are on.

510
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,740
-我們都宣誓了的  -我們都是嗎
- We're all under oath here.  - We are?

511
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,040
他是
He is.

512
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,320
我有獨立分析報告
And I have independent analysis

513
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,240
以及其他執行總裁的證詞
and sworn testimony from other CEOs

514
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,520
與您當事人的證言正好相反
disputing everything your client just said.

515
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,690
這些證據的證明力不值一提
Those things aren't worth the paper they're printed on.

516
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,640
我的意思是我們可以法庭相見
My point is that you can go to court,

517
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,120
為了一場你可能贏不了的官司打上數年
spend years fighting a battle you may not win,

518
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,500
或者接受這份和解方案
or you can take this settlement.

519
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,910
這方案還挺合理的
This is actually pretty fair.

520
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,860
何止是合理
More than fair.

521
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,860
只不過  他想讓我們在上面簽字
The only thing is, he's trying to get us to sign it,

522
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,690
然后在法庭上質證我們
so he can use it against us in court.

523
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,580
就像去年他對付美光科技
Just like he did last year against Micron

524
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,580
以及前年對付陽光科技那樣
and the year before that against Suntech.

525
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,600
你還真是一招吃天下  阿奇伯德
You're just a one-trick pony, Archibald.

526
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,360
一旦你的招數暴露  就無能為力了
And once you've been to the show, it's not that good.

527
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,170
你也只有一招  雷吉納德
Hmm, you're a one-trick pony too, Reginald.

528
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,460
只不過我的招數不會讓我的客戶起訴我
Only my trick doesn't end with my own client suing me.

529
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,610
-這次取證結束了  -什么叫結束了
- This deposition's over.  - What do you mean, it's over?

530
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,170
難道你不想讓沃克先生知道
Don't you want Mr. Walker to know

531
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,990
你曾被指控玩忽職守
that you were just sued for malpractice?

532
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,270
那名當事人撤銷了指控
That client dropped that suit.

533
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,110
在她撤銷之前  她曾經作出過正式聲明
And before she did, she stated on the record

534
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,630
稱她因你與對方律師的私人恩怨
that she got shafted because you had a personal vendetta

535
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,170
導致了她的利益受損
against your opposing counsel.

536
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,480
他喜歡在律師間尋釁滋事
He likes to pick fights with other lawyers,

537
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,340
不在給他的當事人帶來什么影響
and he doesn't give a shit what it does to his clients.

538
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,470
-一派胡言  -是嗎
- Okay, that's a lie.  - It is?

539
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,930
我想你我都清楚他為什么會代理這個案子
I think you and I both know why he took this case,

540
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,270
因為這些官司他都輸了
because he lost this case and this case

541
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:56,870
人人影視
YYeTs.com

542
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,360
在十五年前全都輸給了我
and this case to me 15 years ago.

543
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,750
快去問問他
Go ahead, ask him.

544
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,710
雖然他沒有宣誓  但你會看出來的
He's not under oath, but you'll know if he's lying.

545
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,630
而這些只是模擬法庭的案例
And these cases, they were all in moot court.

546
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,880
想象一下  在真實法庭上他會帶給你什么
Imagine what he'll bring down on you when the stakes are real.

547
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,030
我只能這樣告訴你
I can tell you this much,

548
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,780
它肯定比這份和解方案
it'll be a hell of a lot more expensive

549
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,720
要昂貴得多
than that settlement.

550
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,590
斯坦普爾  取證結束了
Stemple, we're done.

551
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,380
雷吉納德  你的確干得不錯
Reginald, you did a great job

552
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,020
讓我耿耿于懷
making it so I couldn't get out of it,

553
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,850
但你應該挑個更好的案子來對付我
but you should have picked a better case to trap me in.

554
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,710
因為我們都知道我的獨立分析師
Because we both know that my independent analyst

555
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,750
會按照我的意思出具一切報告
will come up with anything that I want him to say.

556
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,680
你聽到他剛剛說的話了嗎
Did you hear what he just said?

557
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,730
當然
I sure did.

558
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,940
如果你我都聽到了
And if you did, and I did...

559
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,210
可能它也錄到了
Maybe it did.

560
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,600
我已經吃過早餐了  邁克爾
I already had breakfast, Michael.

561
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,580
或許吧  但這可是滿滿一袋子培根
Maybe, but that's a bag completely filled with bacon.

562
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,230
酥脆嗎
Crispy?

563
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,270
引用我朋友本杰明的一句話
To quote my friend Benjamin,

564
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,400
無酥脆不成培根
"If it's not crispy, it's not bacon."

565
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,510
我不配吃它
I don't deserve it.

566
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,300
本杰明
Benjamin.

567
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,150
邁克爾  我可以從衛星傳來的音軌上
Michael, I can enhance the sound of a bee

568
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,100
加強蜜蜂采蜜的聲音
making pollen recorded from a satellite.

569
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,340
你怎么能確定
How can you possibly know that?

570
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,030
我做過
It's been done.

571
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,430
但我無法在一個二手錄像機上
But what I can't do is enhance sounds

572
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,130
加強一個根本沒被捕捉到的聲音
that weren't picked up by a used camcorder,

573
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,680
因為律所為了省錢  根本不聽我的建議
because this firm is too cheap to go with my recommendation

574
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,980
購置63000美元的的ZR-X90攝像機
of the $63,000 ZR-X90.

575
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,660
你從來沒建議過  對吧
You didn't really recommend that, did you?

576
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,440
還有助于我在周末拍獨立電影
It's also good for making independent films on weekends.

577
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,500
好了  本杰明
Okay, Benjamin,

578
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,520
我需要這份音軌  否則這個大案子就砸了
I need this audio, or we're screwed on a huge case.

579
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,880
邁克爾  看看這些聲波
Michael, look at these sound waves.

580
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,140
好的
Okay.

581
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,840
-沒有一絲變化  -什么都沒有
- There's nothing there.  - No, nothing.

582
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,000
這還是我連續十二個小時最大限度增強音軌
And that's after 12 hours of maximum enhancement on the tape

583
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,100
并喝了六罐紅牛之后的結果
and six Red Bulls in me.

584
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,150
你不該喝那么多紅牛
Whoa, you shouldn't be having that many Red Bulls.

585
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,610
這都是為了你  邁克爾
I did it for you, Michael.

586
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,690
有什么成果了嗎
What do we have?

587
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,460
沒有
Uh, nothing.

588
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,590
那我們只能用手里的東西了
Then we go with what we got.

589
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,360
他什么意思
What's he talking about?

590
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,940
他在說斯坦普爾嚇唬過我們
He's saying Stemple bluffed,

591
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,260
現在我們也要嚇唬他
so now we're gonna bluff.

592
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,610
先生們  我們要討論什么呢
What exactly are we talking about here, gentlemen?

593
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,470
我們希望得到他的獨立分析師的原始數據
We want access to the raw data from his independent analysis.

594
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,640
我還希望十年前做過結扎呢
And I wish I would've had a vasectomy ten years ago.

595
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,540
原始數據是工作成果  他無權獲得它
But raw data is work product, and he has no right to it.

596
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,480
成果保密權
The work product doctrine

597
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,540
非常明顯  斯佩克先生
is fairly clear on this, Mr. Specter.

598
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,630
但不適用于涉嫌欺詐情況  法官閣下
Except in cases of misconduct, Your Honor,

599
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,790
而目前就是這個情況
which is the situation here.

600
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,600
你們在指控我什么
What exactly are you accusing me of?

601
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,980
在取證的最后  斯坦普爾基本上在吹噓
At the end of our deposition, Mr. Stemple basically boasted

602
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,700
他打算修改他的分析師得出的結果
that he plans to fix the findings of his analyst.

603
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,570
他在說謊
That is a lie.

604
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,140
我從沒有說過這些話
I never said anything of the kind.

605
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:22,990
你是說
What you mean to say is

606
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,810
你覺得我們的攝像機沒有錄下來嗎
you didn't think our microphone would pick it up.

607
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,820
讓我來理清楚
So let me get this straight.

608
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,620
他們篡改了錄像  來指控我篡改報告
They're doctoring a tape to accuse me of doctoring a report.

609
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,730
斯坦普爾  你在我這里有撒謊的前科
Mr. Stemple, you have a history of lying to me.

610
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,980
如果你在那份錄像上
So if you're on that tape

611
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,800
說過任何和他們說的相近的話
saying anything close to what they're claiming,

612
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,990
我不但會處罰你  還會向律師委員會舉報你
I'll not only sanction you, I'll report you to the Bar.

613
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,130
我會給他們原始數據
I'll give them what they want.

614
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,350
我得承認  當我看到六億歐元時
I have to admit, when I read 600 million euros,

615
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,590
-還以為是個打印錯誤  -并不是
- I thought it was a typo.  - It wasn't.

616
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,240
波羅的海運在六個小時之內把一瓶
Baltic Freight can get a bottle of riesling

617
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,940
雷斯林從阿爾薩斯葡萄園運到迪拜的旅館
from an Alsatian vineyard to a Dubai hotel in six hours.

618
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,980
-這是偷竊  -我同意  這份計劃書
- This is a steal. - I agree. The proposal--

619
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,050
是自《五十度灰》以來最吸引我的東西了
most riveting thing I've read since Fifty Shades of Grey.

620
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:54,930
-但是  -但是
- But--  - But,

621
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,720
對您最有利的是我...
but the real upside for you is that I...

622
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,940
-我們  -并不是
- We.  - Not exactly.

623
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,840
想出了一個方案能在美國合法避稅
Structured the deal to avoid U.S. Taxes.

624
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,440
在塞浦路斯設立一家子公司
By setting up a subsidiary with headquarters in Cyprus.

625
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,120
那里的稅率只有5.7%
Where the rate is only 5.7%.

626
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,180
等等
Wait a second,

627
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,700
那不是意味著他們得在塞浦路斯建廠
doesn't that mean they would have to build in Cyprus?

628
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,470
我已經看好了一名開發商
Mm-hmm, and I've already locked up a developer.

629
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,680
我看到了  惠特納集團
Yeah, I see that, the Whitner Group.

630
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,580
打斷一下  你是說惠特納集團嗎
Whoa, I'm so sorry. Did you just say Whitner Group?

631
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,610
現在他們正因涉嫌欺詐
Right now they're being investigated

632
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,910
接受聯邦貿易委員會的調查
by the FTC for fraud.

633
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,670
什么
What?

634
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,190
是的  今早才宣布的消息
Yeah, it was just announced this morning.

635
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,900
那些肯定都是被嫉妒的競爭對手
Well, those are bogus charges concocted by a jealous competitor

636
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,810
不擇手段炮制出來的虛假指控
who will stop at nothing--

637
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,730
很抱歉  湯姆
I'm so sorry, Tom.

638
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,850
正如達娜剛剛說的  我只收到了抄送
As Dana mentioned, I was C.C.'d on this,

639
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,290
但我之前并沒有機會去審查它
but I didn't exactly have a chance to vet it.

640
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:30,930
湯姆
Tom.

641
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,420
名聲就是我們的一切  斯科特女士
Our reputation is everything, Ms. Scott.

642
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,450
我們不能和罪犯串通一氣
We can't be in bed with criminals.

643
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,740
我會在一小時之內給你另一份提案的
I will have another proposal over to you within the hour.

644
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,590
謝謝你  路易
Thank you, Louis.

645
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,270
對了  還有  湯姆  斯科特是新來的
Oh, and, Tom, Scottie's new, okay?

646
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,460
放她一馬
So just cut her some slack.

647
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,650
等她能獨當一面的時候
Because when those training wheels pop off,

648
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,720
她會很棒的
she's gonna be really, really good.

649
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,330
-你做了什么  -什么也沒做
- What the hell did you do?  - Nothing.

650
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,810
我只是給聯邦貿易委員會的朋友打了個電話
I just called a friend at the FTC.

651
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,360
你捏造了一個起訴來對付一家公司
You made up charges against a company

652
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,290
就是為了對付我
just to get back at me?

653
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,590
我才沒做過這種事呢
I did nothing of the kind.

654
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,800
我只是簡單地提醒了一個朋友
I simply alerted a friend

655
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,940
說了說一些可能的不軌行為
to some possible misdoings.

656
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,110
那可都是人啊
These are people.

657
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,520
你損害了他們的生意
You are hurting their business.

658
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,040
拜托  饒了我吧
Oh, please, give me a break.

659
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,110
他們又沒上市
They're not publicly traded.

660
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,470
也沒有股價給他們下跌
They don't have a stock price that'll fall.

661
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,480
而且假如他們像你宣稱的一樣正經
And if they're as clean as you say,

662
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,900
我確定他們會擺脫指控的
I'm sure they'll be exonerated.

663
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,270
但不會是富蘭克林的案子還在我手上期間
But not in time for me to get Franklin's business.

664
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,950
我才不在乎他們什么時候擺脫
Oh, I don't give a shit when they're exonerated.

665
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,660
你永遠拿不到富蘭克林的案子
You're never getting Franklin's business.

666
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,940
你真是個賤人
You really are a dick.

667
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,240
我是個白鯨級別的大賤人
I'm Moby Goddamn Dick,

668
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,940
Moby Dick: 《白鯨記》(世界名著)

669
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,390
而你剛剛不知好歹闖進我的水域了
and you just swam in my waters.

670
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,450
按照你的要求  全部都在這里了
Per your request, this is everything.

671
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,300
你來這里不止是為了送工作成果的吧
You didn't just come over here to deliver work product.

672
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,740
我收到了一份修改后的和解協議
I've got a revised settlement offer.

673
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,970
先讓我把話說完
And before you say anything,

674
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,480
這里面有個禁止我用這個來起訴你的條款
it contains a provision prohibiting me from using it against you.

675
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,570
在今天發生的事情之后
After what happened today,

676
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,530
你還覺得我會同意和解嗎
you think I'm going to settle?

677
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,300
拜托了  哈維  你就看一眼吧
Please, Harvey, just take a look at it.

678
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,830
現在你有求于我了
So now that you need something,

679
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,720
就喊我哈維而不是雷吉納德了
it's Harvey, not Reginald.

680
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,970
你不正是想要和解嗎
Settling is what you do.

681
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,310
但不是和你
Not with you.

682
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,930
至于我不愿和你和解的原因...
And the reason I'm not gonna settle with you--

683
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:56,870
人人影視
YYeTs.com

684
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,050
我知道
I get it.

685
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,560
因為我一直躲著你
I ducked you.

686
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,770
我能接受失敗
Look, I could take the losing,

687
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,350
接受別人的幸災樂禍和各種嘲諷
the gloating, and the taunting.

688
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,860
但我不能忍受的  是輸給一個不敢站起來
But what I can't take is losing to a coward

689
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,800
努力再打敗我一次的懦夫
who's too afraid to stand up and try to beat me again.

690
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,800
我從來沒打敗過你
I didn't beat you the first time.

691
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,410
你在說什么鬼呢
What the hell are you talking about?

692
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,000
那次是設計好的
It was rigged.

693
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,910
我賄賂了陪審團
I bribed the jury.

694
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,160
-什么  -這就是我一直躲著你的原因
- What?  - That's why I keep ducking you.

695
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,770
你是在告訴我你三年來一直在作弊嗎
You're telling me you cheated all three years?

696
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,340
一旦我贏了
Once I won,

697
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,640
我就是那個打敗哈維·斯佩克特的人了
I was the guy who beat Harvey Specter.

698
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,990
沒辦法回頭了
There was no going back.

699
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,300
而你覺得現在和我坦白能讓我接受和解嗎
And you think admitting that now is gonna make me settle?

700
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,630
我坦白是因為現在是時候讓自己心安一點了
I'm coming clean because it's time to put it to bed.

701
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,110
讓自己心安一點
Put it to bed?

702
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,470
你是打算在報紙上登廣告說你作弊嗎
You gonna take an AD out in the Crims saying you cheated,

703
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,300
就如同當年你打敗我時那樣嗎
just like you did when you beat me back then?

704
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,320
-哈維  -不不  我記的可清楚了
- Harvey.  - No, no, I remember it.

705
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,410
拳王阿里站在拳王利斯頓旁邊
Muhammad Ali standing over Sonny Liston.

706
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,360
你的臉安在了阿里身上
Your face on Ali,

707
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,220
我的臉安在了利斯頓身上
mine on Liston,

708
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,910
那一周每天都登了這幅圖
Every day for a week.

709
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,050
你知道我心目中的英雄是誰嗎  艾略特
You know who my hero was, Eliot?

710
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,940
阿里
Ali.

711
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,220
沒錯  你個混蛋
That's right, you piece of shit.

712
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,690
你想知道我為何要那么做嗎
You want to know why I did that?

713
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,500
因為你說個傲慢的混蛋
Because you were an arrogant bastard

714
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,800
生活瀟灑  對什么事都漫不經心
who skated through life without a care in the world,

715
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,960
從你需要的任何人手中拿到你想要的一切
Getting everything you wanted from anyone you needed!

716
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,370
還有  你知道嗎
And you know what,

717
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,330
假如再來一次
if I had to do it again,

718
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,010
我還會那么做的
I would do the exact same thing.

719
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,440
我不會和解的
I'm not settling.

720
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:26,680
只要你有一點違法的想法
You so much as think about breaking the law on this case,

721
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,720
我保證你最后會進監獄的
I guarantee you'll end up in jail.

722
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,160
-這是...  -沒錯
- Is this-- - Yes.

723
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,850
-加了...  -是的
- With extra-- - Yes.

724
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,590
-我為何享有如此殊榮  -達娜·斯科特
- To what do I owe this honor? - Dana Scott.

725
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,980
-不行  -聽我說完
- No. - Hear me out.

726
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,620
你贏了
You won.

727
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,100
我不是要你向她屈服
I'm not saying you have to give in to her.

728
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,650
我是要你修補一下你倆的關系
I'm saying, make amends with her.

729
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,170
那我為什么要這么做呢
Mm, and why would I want to do that?

730
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,210
假如你能站在她的角度思考問題
Well, it would help if you tried

731
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,420
會有很大幫助的
putting yourself in her shoes.

732
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,240
站在她試圖拐跑我的客戶的角度嗎
The same shoes that tried walking away with my client?

733
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,800
路易  我想說的就是
Louis, all I'm saying is,

734
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,590
她從達比國際跳槽來這里
she came here from Darby International

735
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,170
就為了當哈維的女朋友
to be Harvey's girlfriend.

736
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,500
這個就足夠分量
I'd say that's enough baggage

737
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,170
讓你放她一馬了
to deserve you cutting her some slack.

738
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,660
但我確實已經放了她一馬了啊  唐娜
But I did cut her some slack, Donna.

739
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,080
我給她買了世界上最好的披肩
I bought her the world's finest pashmina,

740
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,440
但反過來她卻用那個來擦屁股
and she wiped her ass with it in return.

741
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,890
行了  我明白了
Okay, I got it.

742
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,740
你永遠也不會喜歡她的
You're never gonna like her.

743
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,480
就當我什么也沒說吧
Forget I said anything.

744
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,190
等等
Wait a second.

745
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,860
是哈維派你來的嗎
Did harvey send you here?

746
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,180
不是  路易  他沒派我來
No, Louis, he didn't.

747
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,430
哈維才不關心這種事呢
Harvey doesn't care about this.

748
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,720
那你為什么關心這個呢
Why do you?

749
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,890
因為我了解哈維  我了解斯科特
Because I know Harvey, I know Scottie,

750
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,340
我也了解你
and I know you.

751
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,870
如果沒人讓步的話
And if somebody doesn't back down,

752
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,380
這件事不會有好結果的
this isn't gonna end well.

753
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,670
你是說你或者哈維
Are you saying that you or Harvey

754
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,310
會拿這個來對付我嗎
are gonna hold this against me?

755
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,180
不是  路易  我沒這么說
No, Louis, I'm not saying that.

756
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,070
那就好  因為這樣的話
Good, because then

757
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,280
我就要和你學學我對他說的話了
I'll tell you what I told him.

758
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,970
假如我們的友誼就靠這個
If our friendship is dependent on this,

759
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,940
那我們之間就沒有友誼可言了
then we do not have a friendship at all.

760
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,430
不是的
It's not.

761
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,260
我只是想幫忙而已
I was just trying to help.

762
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,270
莫里斯先生
Mr. Morris,

763
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,830
請你告訴法庭  原始數據說明了
please tell the court what the raw data indicates

764
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,710
這兩個公司的微處理器的什么問題
about the two companies' microprocessors.

765
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,810
而且我要提醒你  你是宣過誓的
And I remind you, you're under oath.

766
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,630
兩個產品運行于相同的速度
Both products operate at the exact same rate.

767
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,970
你的意思是
What you're saying is,

768
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,310
我們的產品和他們不相上下
our product is just as good as theirs.

769
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,550
我的意思是  他們的表現是相同的
I'm saying their performance is identical.

770
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,620
而且亞努什在市場上占主導地位
And yet Janus dominates the marketplace.

771
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,430
為什么會這樣呢
Why is that?

772
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,890
反對  這是要求證人作出推測
Objection. Calls for speculation.

773
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,950
讓我來告訴你為什么
Oh, I'll tell you why.

774
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,750
這和產品的優越性毫無關系
It has nothing to do with product superiority

775
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,620
一切都是亞努什在欺壓他的競爭對手
and everything to do with Janus bullying its competitors.

776
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,630
你剛剛既不是在提問
That's not a question,

777
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,870
你所說的和莫里斯先生的專業領域無關
nor is it Mr. Morris' area of expertise.

778
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,170
對  的確無關
No, it isn't.

779
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,100
恃強凌弱是他客戶的專業領域
Bullying is his client's area of expertise.

780
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,880
暫無其他問題
No further questions.

781
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,070
莫里斯先生  你剛剛指證
Mr. Morris, you just testified

782
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,470
兩種微處理器的表現是相同的
that the microprocessors' performance was identical.

783
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,700
那有沒有可能他們實際上就是雷同的呢
Is it possible that they are actually identical?

784
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,810
任何事都是有可能的
Anything's possible.

785
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,830
在什么情況下才有可能呢
How would that be?

786
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,890
這要么是一個極小概率事件
Either it's a one-in-a-billion event,

787
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,430
要么是一方偷了另一方的設計
or one of them stole the other one's design.

788
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,040
法官大人  基于對方律師引入的證據
Your honor, based on evidence introduced by opposing counsel

789
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,430
以及莫里斯先生的作證
and Mr. Morris' testimony,

790
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,130
我希望提出反訴
I would like to file a countersuit

791
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,730
控告AYZ科技侵犯專利權
Against AYZ for patent infringement.

792
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,410
這簡直是離譜
That is outrageous.

793
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,870
他的客戶剽竊了我的客戶的設計
His client stole my client's design.

794
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,400
我才是該憤怒的人
I am the one who is outraged.

795
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,990
這案子和侵犯專利權半點關系都沒有
This case has nothing to do with patent infringement.

796
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,920
現在有關系了  雷吉納德
It does now, Reginald.

797
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:13,900
讓開
Move!

798
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,450
我們得談談
We need to talk.

799
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,250
現在不行  我在補充碳水化合物
Not now, I'm carbo-loading.

800
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,030
為了什么
For what?

801
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,570
為了你啊  我們還在交戰呢
For you! We're still at war.

802
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,920
不  才沒有
No, we're not.

803
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,060
那什么意思
So what,

804
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,750
你在揮旗求饒嗎
you're telling me you're waving the white flag?

805
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,030
不是  我在揮舞這個
No, I am waving this,

806
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,800
公司章程第19.5條B款
bylaw 19.5/B,

807
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,170
明顯違背第139條J款
in clear violation of 139/J.

808
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,950
我得到了139條J款的通過
I got ratification per 139J.

809
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,420
法定人數未達到
There wasn't a quorum present.

810
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,550
沒什么大礙  技術犯規而已
Big deal, technical violation.

811
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,130
對你可不一樣  你是章程委員會的
Not for you. You're on the bylaw committee.

812
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,600
你知道章程中對于委員會成員
And you know what the bylaws say about a member of the committee

813
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,700
私自執行未經批準的修正案怎么處理吧
implementing an amendment without approval?

814
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,540
立即除名
Immediate removal.

815
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,830
所以你離我的案子遠點
So back the hell off my case.

816
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,750
這靠不住的
This won't stand.

817
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,120
路易  我警告你別繼續糾纏
Louis, I am warning you to not keep pursuing this.

818
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,390
我之前贏過你  不介意再贏一次
I've beaten you before, and I will beat you again.

819
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:56,870
人人影視
YYeTs.com

820
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,950
-你才沒贏過我  -沒有嗎
- You've never beaten me before. - Haven't I?

821
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,990
那你覺得是誰讓奈杰爾
Who do you think it was that assigned Nigel

822
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,200
在解約談判上和你對抗的
to go against you in the dissolution talks?

823
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,330
喵嗚
Meow.

824
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,030
-你這個魔鬼  -不
- You're the devil. - No.

825
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,320
我不是魔鬼  我只是講究策略
I'm not the devil. I'm a strategic thinker.

826
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,310
路易·利特  我特此通知你
Louis Litt, you are hereby notified

827
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,740
在富蘭克林·庫里耶一案中
that your services are no longer needed

828
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,710
不再需要你了
on Franklin Courier.

829
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,990
如果你再來煩我  
And if you go around me,

830
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,410
我就用139條J款把你殺得片甲不留
I will invoke 139J on your ass.

831
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:24,660
他暗算我們
He set us up.

832
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,870
你以為我看不出來嗎
You think I don't know that?

833
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,460
他弄得我們的客戶像個竊賊一樣
He made our client look like a thief.

834
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,260
分明就是騙人
It's not true.

835
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,330
是真是假已經不重要了
It doesn't matter if it's not true.

836
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,870
我們現在處于被動
Now we're on the defensive.

837
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,550
先生們  和解條件
Gentlemen, that settlement offer

838
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,100
已經不再適用了
is about to get flipped on its ass.

839
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,400
多謝你們引入的證據
And thank you for introducing that evidence,

840
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,280
由我說出來的話就沒這么可信了
'cause it wouldn't have been as credible coming from me.

841
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,820
你使計套我們的話
You dropped that comment on purpose.

842
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,490
我知道攝像機不會錄下這段
Mm-hmm. I knew that camcorder wouldn't pick it up,

843
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,810
我也知道你會嚇唬我說要拿到證據
just like I knew you would bluff to get that data.

844
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,750
是你算計我們了  不然我們早料到了
You made us work for it, or we would've seen it coming.

845
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,240
他才不會料到
He would never have seen anything coming

846
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,380
我之前騙他說我賄賂陪審團了
once I fed him that bullshit about bribing the jury.

847
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,410
我太了解你了  雷吉納德
I've got your number, Reginald.

848
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,930
我可沒陷害你  只是略施小計而已
I haven't been ducking you. I've just been setting you up.

849
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,770
這都是跟你的偶像學的
I took a page from your hero's playbook,

850
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,290
伺機反攻
Rope-a-dope.

851
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,450
我都聽說了
I heard about today.

852
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,250
即使你沒聽說
If you hadn't,

853
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,930
明天也能從報紙上看到
I'm sure there'll be an ad about it in the paper tomorrow.

854
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,190
什么
What?

855
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,090
斯坦普爾說他對我了如指掌  說的沒錯
Stemple says he's got my number, and it's true.

856
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,620
我不知道該怎么辦了
I don't know what to do.

857
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,220
我們有什么選擇嗎
What are our options?

858
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,830
就我所知  接受和解是最優方案了
For all I know, this deal's the best I'm ever going to get.

859
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,530
斯坦普爾每次都考慮得先我一步
Stemple's been outthinking me ever since I met him.

860
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,900
除了他  也就你能這樣了
You're the only other person who's ever done that.

861
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,290
我需要你的幫助
I need your help.

862
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,760
我跟你說過我高中時打網球的經歷嗎
Have I ever told you about my high school tennis career?

863
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,450
我都不知道你會打網球
I didn't even know you played.

864
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,880
我的成績是38勝3負
I was 38 and 3.

865
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,580
知道我輸給了誰嗎
You know who handed me every one of those losses?

866
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,340
艾略特·斯丹普爾嗎
Eliot Stemple?

867
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,770
瑪莎·邁耶斯
Marsha Myers.

868
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,280
一個身高五英尺[152cm]的數學怪咖
A 5-foot-nothing math geek

869
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,830
發球速度每小時20英里[32公里]
with a 20-mile-an-hour serve.

870
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,010
我應該在球場上
I should have left a Marsha Myers skid mark

871
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,100
留個瑪莎·邁耶斯的標記  永不回望
on the court and never looked back.

872
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,990
但是實際上  她簡直就是個回球機器
But instead, the little bitch was a human backboard.

873
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,470
時至今日我仍然無法忘記
And I think about it to this day.

874
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,800
你是建議我接受交易
You're saying I should take the deal

875
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,120
因為我贏不了他
because I can't beat him?

876
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,720
我只是說有個艾略特·斯丹普爾這樣的人
I'm saying I know what it's like

877
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,230
我理解你的心情
to have an Eliot Stemple.

878
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,320
我問你個問題
So I'm going to ask you a question,

879
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,730
我要你立刻回答
and I want you to give me an instant response.

880
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,260
你是想擊敗他  還是想和解
Do you want to beat him, or do you want to settle?

881
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,200
我想留個艾略特·斯坦普爾的標記
I want to leave an Eliot Stemple skid mark.

882
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,620
那就有答案了
Then there's your answer.

883
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,140
如果他對你了如指掌
If he's got your number,

884
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,290
那么你想做的  就是他想要你做的
then what you want to do is what he wants you to do.

885
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,340
哈維  我一直在研究斯坦普爾的案子
Harvey, I've been looking at Stemple's cases.

886
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,490
沒必要了
Doesn't matter.

887
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,780
沒必要了是什么意思
What do you mean it doesn't matter?

888
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,310
我們接受和解條件
We're taking the settlement.

889
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,980
-你就這么放棄了嗎  -杰西卡有個計劃
- You're just gonna give up? - Jessica has a plan.

890
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,520
繼續抗爭下去只能是自投羅網
Fighting is stepping into a trap.

891
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,460
一步步走進他安排的陷阱
We'd be giving him exactly what he wants.

892
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,080
杰西卡錯了
Jessica was wrong.

893
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,500
是這樣嗎
Is that a fact?

894
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,060
你分析問題的角度是對的
You looked at it the right way.

895
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,470
但結論是錯的
You just came to the wrong conclusion.

896
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,310
斯坦普爾是想讓我們繼續  但我知道原因
Stemple wants us to fight, but I know why.

897
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,360
他接手這案子很久了
He was on this case

898
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,100
遠比我們介入的早
long before you and I came into the picture.

899
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,090
他想要的  他真正想要的
What he wants... what he really wants...

900
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,840
其實跟你無關
has nothing to do with you.

901
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,420
你這是準備好大干一場了
Don't you look ready to rumble?

902
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,380
不是
We're not.

903
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,950
我們接受你的條件  但有一點要改
We want to take your deal, with one small change.

904
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,310
我不會降低金額的
I'm not lowering the amount.

905
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,960
這你不必擔心  你要求一千萬美元
No, don't worry. Instead of $10 million,

906
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,300
我們給你一億美元
we'd like to give you 100 million.

907
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,820
即使這么多  也比不上和你打下去
Because that would still cost us less

908
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,150
讓你得到這個  給我們造成的損失
than if we fought you and you got this.

909
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,010
我不知道這是什么
I have no idea what that is.

910
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:28,970
你心知肚明
Yes, you do.

911
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,470
正是這個膠水  使得AYZ科技
It's the glue that enables AYZ

912
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,140
能夠堆棧比你們更多的微芯片
to stack more microchips than you,

913
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,970
你找這東西已經一年了
and you've been after it for a year.

914
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,510
你猜到了我的舉動以后
And when you saw me coming,

915
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,820
趁機誘騙我
you used the opportunity to bait me

916
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,280
讓我引用證據
into introducing evidence

917
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,730
你得以翻盤  并提起訴訟
so that you could turn it around and manufacture a suit

918
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,270
以便順利得到這東西
to get your hands on that during discovery.

919
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,040
你沒證據
You can't prove that.

920
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,050
如果我問你的分析師當初你聘用他的原因
I can when I ask your analyst

921
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,880
我就能得到證據了  
why you hired him in the first place.

922
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,860
他會說亞努什需要這個技術
He's gonna say that Janus needed the technology

923
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,430
不惜一切代價
and was willing to do anything to get it.

924
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,210
你不確定他會供出我
You don't know that he'll roll over on me.

925
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,840
阿里對陣利斯頓
Ali versus Liston.

926
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,950
我會讓他供出你
I'm gonna make him roll over on you.

927
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,780
接下來我建議你
So here's what's gonna happen.

928
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,980
放棄訴訟
You're gonna drop the suit,

929
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,650
公開聲明承認過錯  賠償我們這些金額
publicly admit to wrongdoing, and pay us this.

930
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,480
這可讓我的客戶損失大了
This'll cost my client a fortune.

931
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,270
是啊  但總比被判成
Yeah, but it's better than being convicted

932
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,490
商業間諜罪要好
of corporate espionage.

933
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,780
艾略特  我可是想讓你體面的退出
Eliot, I'm giving you a dignified way out,

934
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,410
一個真正了解的機會
a chance to really put it to bed.

935
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,880
再有三十秒  法官就要開庭了
Now the judge is gonna bang that gavel in 30 seconds.

936
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,570
一旦開庭  一切都不可挽救了
And when that happens, it's gonna be too late.

937
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,140
成交
We'll take the deal.

938
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,570
我說  如果你想引用個電影情節的話
I'm just saying, if you're gonna quote a movie,

939
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,400
就原話引用
Quote a movie.

940
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,710
就說錯了一個詞
I got one word wrong.

941
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,020
整個引用都沒有意義了
It changed the entire meaning of the quote.

942
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,390
我可沒覺得
Not to me, it didn't.

943
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,520
我以為原話就這樣
That's what I thought the quote was.

944
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,170
好吧
Okay, fine.

945
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:58,270
如果你不尊重馬丁·斯科西斯的話
You want to be disrespectful to Martin Scorsese,

946
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:56,870
人人影視
YYeTs.com

947
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,350
那隨你吧
you go right ahead.

948
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,590
劇本又不是馬丁·斯科西斯寫的
Martin Scorsese didn't even write the damn movie.

949
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,390
就算不尊重  也是不尊重編劇
If anything, it's disrespectful to the writer.

950
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,480
哈維  沒人在乎編劇是誰
Harvey, who cares about the writer?

951
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,120
這話有道理
I guess you're right about that.

952
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,190
-你們去哪兒了  -請他去吃飯了
- Where have you two been? - I took him to dinner.

953
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,840
這倒是挺新鮮啊
Oh, that's never happened before.

954
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,230
他從來沒贏過A.艾略特·斯坦普爾  對吧
Well, he's never beaten A.Eliot Stemple before.

955
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,920
沒贏過
No, he hasn't.

956
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,030
那這次有什么不同呢
What could be different about this time?

957
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,890
我當時沒為他工作
I didn't work for him then.

958
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,190
但有你在的時候
Yeah, but didn't he duck Harvey

959
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,150
他不是一直在躲著哈維嗎
the whole time you did work for him?

960
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,090
好吧
Okay, fine.

961
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,000
打敗斯坦普爾是你的功勞
You were responsible for beating Stemple,

962
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,370
但是最開始是我告訴你哈維那幾次
but I was the one who told you about Harvey's shameful losses

963
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,170
慘敗事跡的
in the first place.

964
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,480
他常說的那句話怎么說來著
What does he always say?

965
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,650
零對無數  唐娜  零對無數
0 and everything, Donna. 0 and everything.

966
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,630
說完了嗎
Are you finished?

967
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,860
是的  謝謝
Yes, thank you.

968
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,050
對了  杰西卡讓你回來以后
Oh, and Jessica wanted to see you

969
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,770
盡快去找她
as soon as you got back.

970
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,650
她說是因為什么事情了嗎
She say what it's about?

971
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,540
沒有  但我是在跟邁克講話
No, but I was talking to Mike.

972
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,410
我聽說你贏了
I heard you won.

973
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,800
-我們不只是贏了  -我知道
- Oh, we didn't just win. - I know.

974
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,180
你讓一個財富500強公司公開承認過錯
You got a fortune 500 company to publicly admit wrongdoing.

975
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,630
這可不是每天都有的事情
Doesn't happen every day.

976
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,420
那你怎么還看起來不高興呢
So why don't you look happy?

977
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,660
贏了官司我很高興
I am happy about the win.

978
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,280
但我接到了《紐約律師》編輯的電話
But I got a call from the editor of New York Lawyer,

979
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,260
他們想采訪這次
and they want to interview the man responsible

980
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,630
訴訟的負責人
for making that happen.

981
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,390
然后你想把功勞都給哈維
And you want to give Harvey the credit.

982
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,860
我想讓你把自己的名字撤下來
I want you to take your name off.

983
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,850
我已經那么做了
I already did.

984
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,070
這個案子本身就不是為了我  是為哈維
This case was never for me. It was for harvey.

985
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,590
斯坦普爾上鉤的那一刻起
I took my name off as first chair

986
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,330
我就把自己的名字從第一律師上撤了下來
the second we trapped Stemple.

987
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,180
很感謝你那么做了
I appreciate that.

988
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,490
但因為這個采訪  你無法以任何身份出現
But because of this interview, you can't be any chair.

989
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,950
所以你讓我從這個案子上撤下來
So you don't want me off this case

990
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,180
不是為了把功勞給哈維
so that Harvey can get the credit.

991
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,280
你把我撤下來
You want me off this case,

992
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,470
是為了讓我遠離聚光燈
so I don't get anywhere near the spotlight.

993
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,860
從你的角度出發
In your position,

994
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,410
聚光燈可以很快的
the spotlight can become an interrogation lamp

995
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,810
變成審訊燈
pretty damn fast.

996
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,410
我理解
I understand.

997
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,560
不要聚光燈
No spotlight.

998
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,100
本來就會是這樣  對嗎
This is always how it's gonna be, isn't it?

999
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,750
我以為你知道
I thought you knew that.

1000
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,890
我知道
I guess I did.

1001
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,930
能和你談談嗎
Hey, can I talk to you?

1002
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,780
當然  路易  有什么可以效勞的
Sure, Louis. What can I do for you?

1003
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,520
你肯定聽說了達娜·斯科特搶我客戶的事
Um, I'm sure you heard about Dana Scott's throttling of me.

1004
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,720
還沒有
I haven't.

1005
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,330
你們兩個都想我不要干預  所以我沒有
You both wanted me to stay out of it, and I did.

1006
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,290
對的
Right.

1007
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,020
斯科特搶了我的案子后  我去找杰西卡
See, after Scottie took my case, I went to Jessica.

1008
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,990
我是想去斗個你死我活的  她跟我說
I was after blood, and... she told me--

1009
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,810
她跟我說這些事是我自找的
she told me that I bring these things on myself,

1010
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,400
她說得對
and she was right.

1011
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,380
那也讓我開始思考  如果我沒有遲到
And that got me to wondering, what would've happened

1012
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:49,390
會發生什么事情
if I hadn't shown up to that meeting late?

1013
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,730
所以我去了閱覽室
So I went to the library,

1014
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,170
找了本公司章程
and I found a copy of the bylaws.

1015
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,320
斯科特劃出了六個不同的陷阱
Scottie underlined six different traps.

1016
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,550
她就是故意要讓我難堪的
She deliberately picked a fight to embarrass me,

1017
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,200
我想知道你知不知情
and I want to know if you knew.

1018
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,560
她那么做不是為了讓你難堪
She didn't do it to embarrass you.

1019
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,160
她是想打敗律所里最兇最毒的律師
She wanted to beat the meanest, toughest guy at the firm.

1020
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,650
-好吧  -這是出于一種敬意
- Okay. - It's a sign of respect.

1021
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,920
但這種情況的問題所在是
See, the problem with that is,

1022
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,150
當那個人輸了以后  他就完蛋了
when that guy loses... he's done.

1023
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,800
他就再也不是律所里最兇最毒的律師了
He is no longer the meanest, baddest guy in the firm.

1024
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,590
他就一無是處了
He's nothing.

1025
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,750
路易
Louis...

1026
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,450
你想讓我怎么做
What do you want from me?

1027
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,380
我想讓你利用你的力量
I need you to use your power

1028
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,880
從斯科特那里幫我把案子搶過來
to give me this case over Scottie.

1029
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,680
我不能那么做
I can't do that.

1030
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,290
哈維  她輸了沒關系  但我不行
Harvey, she can survive this. I can't.

1031
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,470
-路易  -聽著  你來找我
- Louis-- - Listen, you came to me

1032
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,450
需要我幫忙的時候說我是你的朋友
and said I was your friend when you needed a favor.

1033
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,780
現在我來找你了
Well, I am now coming to you,

1034
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,680
說我也需要你的幫忙
saying that I need a favor in return.

1035
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,570
上次我們談這事的時候
The last time we talked,

1036
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,150
你說如果我珍視我們的友誼
you said if I value our friendship at all,

1037
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,110
那我就不會干預這件事
I'd stay out of it.

1038
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,220
我不在乎
I don't care.

1039
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,040
我知道你的做事風格
I know how you operate.

1040
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,840
我為你放了邁克一馬
I let it go with Mike for you.

1041
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,270
而我現在要求你做的事情
And what I'm asking for in return

1042
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,040
根本無法與那件事相提并論  所以
doesn't even come close, so...

1043
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,680
那確實是我的做事風格  路易 
I do operate that way, louis,

1044
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,780
但和朋友不是那樣
but not with my friends.

1045
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,630
所以我只問你一次
So I'm only gonna ask you this once.

1046
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,410
你是作為朋友求我  還是讓我還人情
Are you asking as a friend, or are you calling in a chit?

1047
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,130
還人情
I'm calling in a chit.

1048
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,440
那好吧
So be it.

1049
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,320
-你生氣了嗎  -我很失望
- Are you mad? - I'm disappointed.

1050
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,970
哈維  我
Harvey, I--

1051
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,290
你不能二者兼得  路易
You can't have it both ways, Louis.

1052
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,890
家具到了
The furniture came.

1053
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,760
我知道我們之前說都聽我的
Look, I know we said that we'd go with all my choices,

1054
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,650
但看來你的品位還不錯
but it turns out you have got pretty good taste.

1055
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,050
是啊  我有
Yes. Yes, I do.

1056
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,240
所以  你覺得怎么樣
So? What do you think?

1057
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,810
我覺得我簡直不敢相信
I think that I can't believe

1058
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,820
你在一天之內做了這么多事
you did all of this in one day.

1059
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,770
我回家以后就一直在忙
Well, I've been working on it since I got home.

1060
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,040
我只是想趕快弄完
I just wanted to have all of it ready,

1061
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,960
好慶祝你的勝利
so we could celebrate your big win.

1062
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,010
哈維開心嗎
Was Harvey appreciative?

1063
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,670
當然了  他還帶我去吃晚餐了
Yeah, are you kidding? He took me out to dinner.

1064
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,490
晚餐啊
Oh! Dinner.

1065
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,740
下一件事就是升職了
Next thing you know, you'll be getting a promotion.

1066
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,920
是啊  下一件
Yeah. Next thing.

1067
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,410
-你好  -你也好
- Hey. - Hey, yourself.

1068
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,530
我希望你不介意我自己開門進來了
I hope you don't mind that I let myself in.

1069
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,980
準備好慶祝了嗎
You ready to celebrate?

1070
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,850
-準備好喝一杯了  -那可要快點
- I'm ready for a drink. - Well, hurry up.

1071
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,330
因為這件衣服下
Because underneath these clothes,

1072
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,130
我可是全裸
I am entirely naked.

1073
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,370
斯科特
Scottie.

1074
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,900
怎么了
What's wrong?

1075
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,800
你之前心情還很好啊
You were in such a good mood earlier.

1076
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,920
發生了什么事
What happened?

1077
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,940
是很好
I was.

1078
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,440
但是呢
But?

1079
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,250
斯科特  我需要你把案子還給路易
Scottie, I need you to give Louis his transaction back.

1080
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,590
什么
What?

1081
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,300
他發現整件事都是你陷害他的
He figured out that you set the whole thing up,

1082
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,330
然后來找我了
and he came to me.

1083
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,460
所以呢
So what?

1084
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,480
那有什么關系呢
What does that have to do with anything?

1085
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,430
你輸了沒關系  他不行
You can survive this. He can't.

1086
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,330
等等  讓我理一下
Wait, so let me get this straight.

1087
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:31,460
路易說如果我輸了
Louis tells me that if I lose

1088
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,560
我不能跑去找我的男朋友
I can't go running to my boyfriend,

1089
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,210
但他轉身就去做了同樣的事
and then he turned around and does the exact same thing?

1090
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,150
斯科特  我需要你這么做
Scottie, I need you to do this.

1091
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,820
這和他之前幫你的那個忙有關系嗎
Does this have something to do with that favor he did you?

1092
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,320
是的
Yes.

1093
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,680
好  那告訴我是什么事
Okay. Tell me what it is.

1094
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,660
不行
I can't.

1095
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:53,910
看來我們根本不是
Guess we're not sharing everything

1096
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,090
分享所有秘密了
with each other after all.

1097
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:55,690
斯科特
Scottie.

1098
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,080
哈維  在你開口之前
Harvey, before you say what you're about to say,

1099
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,280
我需要知道
I need to know.

1100
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,840
我是在和我的男朋友講話
Am I talking to my boyfriend,

1101
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,500
還是在和冠名合伙人講話
or am I talking to a name partner?

1102
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,640
那要看你的回答是什么
That depends on your answer.

1103
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,850
你不能二者兼得  哈維
You can't have it both ways, Harvey.

1104
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,320
那你就是在和冠名合伙人講話
Then you're talking to a name partner.
