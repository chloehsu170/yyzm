{\an8}雷迪克&博斯曼&科斯达律所

22
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,810
当我环顾这个房间  我看到了
When I look around this room, I see the future,

23
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,420
用力量和韧性铸就的未来
defined by strength, resilience,

24
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,220
以及团结协作的决心
and the determination to work together.

25
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,720
当我们站在佩图斯桥的中央
So, now, when we stood in the center of the Pettus Bridge...

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
看着阿拉巴马州的塞尔玛
and that's Selma, Alabama...

27
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,370
{\an8}1965年由马丁·路德·金带领的争取黑人投票权的游行

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,370
同时  我们又惊讶地看见了这些士兵
we looked and we saw these troopers at the other end,

29
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,100
他们的步枪交织在一起
and their rifles in tow, and we were surprised, you know.

30
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,450
但我们高贵的灵魂当中
But not one of our precious souls

31
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,280
谁都没有表现出任何一丝恐惧
expressed an ounce of fear.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,950
如果你有值得为之反抗的事情
If you have anything worth fighting against,

33
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,400
无论是有失公正
whether it's injustice

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,320
还是失控的总统
or an out of control president...

35
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,830
你们都要大无畏地站在对立面上
you stand in the face of opposition fearlessly.

36
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,640
这就是这家律所要诠释的精神
Now, that's what this firm represents.

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,810
这就是你们要做的  你们都是战士
That's what you all are. You're all fighters.

38
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,050
人人皆是
Each and every one of you.

39
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,130
你们是战士
You're fighters.

40
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,420
我就说这些
I'm done for the day.

41
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,470
好的  好的
Okay, okay.

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,550
我们的律所还是要干活的
We still have a firm to operate.

43
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,960
而且我们不想把创办合伙人搞得精疲力尽
Besides, we don't want to exhaust - our founding partner.

44
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,480
没关系  芭芭拉  好了
That's all right, Barbara. All right, now.

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,660
大家都回去工作吧
Back to work, y'all.

46
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,700
你知道他要来吗
Did you know he was coming?

47
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,770
不知道
No.

48
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,860
你知道他想要什么吗
You know what he wants?

49
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,980
想看看我们在做什么吧
To see how we're doing.

50
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,130
我看更像是抱怨我们的所作所为
Complain about how we're doing, more like.

51
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,480
-阿德里安  -卡尔
- Adrian. - Carl.

52
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,010
-你怎么样  -挺好的  你呢
- How you doing? - All right. How you doing?

53
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,160
挺好挺好
Good, good.

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,790
你有空吗
Hey, uh, you got a minute?

55
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,790
有空  有空  进来吧
Yeah, yeah, go on in.

56
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,190
-这吗  好的  -对  继续
- In here? Okay. - Yeah, go on.

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,140
芭芭拉
Barbara.

58
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,800
黛安
Diane.

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,780
你确定吗
Are you sure?

60
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,690
我了解卡尔
I know Carl; 

61
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,840
他很有可能只想谈谈警方暴力执法的案子
he probably just wants to talk about the police brutality cases.

62
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,810
来吧
Come on.

63
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,230
还是咱们冠名合伙人之间吧
Maybe just the name partners?

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,310
-也许...  -当然
- You know, maybe... - Oh, of course.

65
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,040
等等
Well, wait, wait.

66
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,170
黛安是执行委员会的  卡尔
Diane's on the executive committee, Carl.

67
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,350
让她留在这个应该是个好主意
Probably a good idea that she be here.

68
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,870
哥们  这边到底什么情况啊
Hey, man, what the hell is going on here?

69
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,000
我一转身
I turn my back,

70
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,250
咱们就被起诉了
and we're being indicted.

71
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,420
我们不是被起诉  卡尔
We were not indicted, Carl.

72
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,320
什么  大陪审团对你穷追不舍的
What, you got grand juries all over your butt, man.

73
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,190
那是因为我们尽了本分
That's because we're doing our jobs.

74
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,370
与此同时  我还是看「洛杉矶时报」才知道
In the meantime, I have to find out from the L.A. Times 

75
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,140
你跟硅谷里
that you just signed with 

76
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,890
最白的公司之一签了合同
one of the whitest companies in Silicon Valley.

77
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,650
你真的是在抱怨我们拿下了一家
You really complaining because we brought in a company

78
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,060
每年能带来8600万收入的公司吗
worth $86 million a year?

79
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,740
那公司只有百分之二的员工是黑人
Yeah, two percent black employment.

80
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,930
那跟我们一点关系都没有  卡尔
We don't have anything to do with that, Carl.

81
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,990
我们要生存  卡尔
We have to make a living, Carl.

82
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,910
还有  我最近总是接到客户的电话
Now, in the meantime, I've been receiving these calls

83
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,200
说感觉到自己
from these clients who are feeling

84
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,890
-被忽视了  -谁  告诉我是谁
- that they're being neglected. - Who? Tell me, who? 

85
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,830
奈杰尔  他说他打电话都找不到你
Nigel. He says he can't get you on the phone.

86
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,050
-奈杰尔·罗杰斯  -是的
- Nigel Rogers? - Yeah.

87
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,830
奈杰尔·罗杰斯自从2009年开始
Nigel Rogers has not made money

88
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,750
就没给律所赚过一分钱  卡尔
for this firm since 2009, Carl!

89
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,970
没准就是因为你不给他回电话
Maybe because you have not returned his call.

90
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,980
你们没事吧  听着像吵架
You all right? Sounds like a fight.

91
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,730
没什么  友好协商纷争而已
Uh, no, just a friendly disagreement.

92
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,370
什么事
What's up?

93
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,480
我就是打电话确认一下咱俩今晚是不是照旧
I'm just checking to see if we're still on for tonight?

94
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,440
-是的  老地方吗  -不  计划有变
- Yeah. Same place, right? - No, change of plans.

95
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,520
-什么  -画廊
- What? - Art gallery.

96
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,590
不行  人太多了
No. Too many people.

97
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,980
得了  那也就能有八个人
Ah, come on. There'll be, like, eight people there.

98
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,680
没人会看到咱俩的  我到洗手间里给你口
No one will see us. I'll go down on you in the bathroom.

99
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,710
你上次就是这么说的
You promised that last time.

100
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,330
是的  这次  我发毒誓
Yeah, well, this time, I double-dog swear.

101
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,630
我把具具发给你
I'll text the deets.

102
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,740
不许说"具具"  我特别讨厌你说"具具"
Don't say "Deets." I hate it when you say "Deets."

103
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,740
{\an8}具体情况的简称

104
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,480
具具  具具  具具  具具
Deet-deet-deet-deets.

105
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,110
你们对黑人群体的责任心哪去了
Well, where's your responsiveness to the community?

106
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,770
哪儿...
I mean, where's your...

107
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,130
行了  卡尔  开什么玩笑
Oh, come on, Carl. Seriously?

108
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,470
卡尔  等等  我们在这
Carl, wait, we are here,

109
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,900
为正义而战  我们就是这么做的
fighting the good fight. That's what we're doing.

110
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,400
各位不好意思  我需要打几通电话
Um, if you'll excuse me, I have some calls to make.

111
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,720
很高兴见到您  先生
It's so nice meeting you, sir.

112
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,110
那不是这家律所的出发点
That was not the point of this firm.

113
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,290
-现在我们...  -开什么玩笑  卡尔
- Now, what are we... - Are you serious, Carl? Come on, come on...

114
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,640
-黛安·洛哈特  -耶利米牧师  你好吗
- Diane Lockhart. - Pastor Jeremiah, how are you?

115
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,330
看见你真高兴
It's so good to see you.

116
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,950
你看上去真不错
You are looking well.

117
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,380
谢谢  你也是
Oh, thank you. As are you.

118
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,870
你看着真年轻
You get younger looking.

119
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,360
不不  是这个时代
No, no, it's the times.

120
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,230
这个时代让你斗志昂扬
It lights a fire in your belly.

121
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,270
再加上动感单车  快进来
That and a stationary bike. Come on in.

122
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,520
卡尔
Hey, Carl,

123
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,620
我都不知道黛安在这工作
I didn't know Diane was working here.

124
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,670
她在少年法庭上令人叹服  清一色法律援助
She performed amazing miracles in juvenile court, all pro bono.

125
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,760
你过奖了
Oh, you're too kind.

126
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,390
我估计卡尔已经把我的问题都告诉你们了
I imagine Carl has told you about my issue.

127
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,530
我还没告诉他们呢
Well, I haven't told them yet.

128
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,000
我们其实在讨论别的事情
You know, we were discussing other business.

129
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:33,890
那我一会儿再过来
Then I'll come back.

130
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,000
别  不用
Oh, no, no, no, no.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,160
我们这就去会议室  让我的
We're gonna go into the conference room and let my, uh,

132
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,130
我的合伙人们讨论他们自己的工作
my partners discuss their work.

133
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,570
黛安  你也一起来好吗
And, uh, Diane, will you join us, please?

134
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,930
当然
Uh, certainly.

135
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,350
他在这待两周就走了
Mm. He's here for two weeks and he's gone.

136
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,540
忍着吧
Patience.

137
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,400
我经营了一个过渡房  是我教会的一部分
It's a transitional house I run, as part of my outreach ministry.

138
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,280
保罗又开始复吸了
And Paul has started to use again.

139
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,830
我需要把这个年轻人驱逐出去
Uh, that's the young man i need to evict.

140
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,390
我让他离开  但是他不肯
Now, I asked him to leave, but he refused.

141
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,630
我严令禁止
And I have strict policies

142
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,240
在过渡房里滥用毒品
against abuse in the house.

143
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,100
是的  一般我们不派发驱逐令  雷夫
Yeah, we don't normally deliver eviction notices, Rev.

144
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,670
我能处理好  阿德里安  用不了太久
I can handle it, Adrian. It won't take long.

145
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,790
你带上迪佩西亚  再加一个律师
Well, take DiPersia and an associate with you,

146
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,030
以防需要的工时比较多
in case it needs more hours.

147
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,470
-会的  -见到你真高兴  牧师
- I shall. - It's good to see you, Pastor.

148
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,840
谢谢你  黛安
Oh, thank you, Diane.

149
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,940
谢谢
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

150
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,120
驱逐令  我们通常还做这个
An eviction? Do we normally do that?

151
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,160
就是帮个忙
It's a favor.

152
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,980
会遇到麻烦吗
Are we expecting trouble?

153
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,430
应该不会
I don't think so.

154
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,500
其实  他说他会做的
Well, actually, he said that he would.

155
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,440
玛娅
Maia?

玛娅  你有空吗

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,880
没有  我在工作
No. No, I don't. I'm working.

161
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
没关系
It's okay.

162
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,270
聊一会吧
Take a minute.

163
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,080
你来这做什么
What are you doing here?

164
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,770
你不接我的电话
Well, you don't answer my calls.

165
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,930
那你就应该不要再打电话了
You should take that as a sign to stop calling, then,

166
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,980
而不是跑到我律所来
not as a sign to drop by my work.

167
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,630
别这样  玛娅
Please, Maia.

168
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,700
玛...
Ma...

176
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,480
用得上吗
You ever need one?

177
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,920
一直都能
All the time.

178
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,250
保罗·约翰逊

179
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,670
-什么事  -你被驱逐了
- Yes? - You're being evicted.

180
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,030
要是我的话  我就捡起来
I'd pick that up.

181
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,620
否则呢
Or?

182
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,280
否则我就很礼貌地让你捡起来
Or I'll ask you politely to pick it up.

183
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,000
这是杰瑞德意思吧
So, this is from Jerry, huh?

184
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,620
真是个混蛋
What an asshole.

185
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,200
连这种下流勾当都要找人来做
Can't even do his own dirty work.

186
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,070
我们是伊斯顿牧师的律师
We're Pastor Easton's attorney,

187
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,800
-我们需要通知你  -这就是你告诉别人
- and we need you to know... - So, this is how you tell someone

188
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,550
你不想再给他们吹箫的方式吗
you don't want to suck their cock anymore?

189
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,620
我们需要通知你  先生
We need you to know, sir,

190
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,420
你已经违反了这个协议的规定
that you have broken the rules of this establishment.

191
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,170
是吗  那个只要他想要我就得操他的规定吗
Really? The rules that I have to fuck him whenever he wants?

192
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,430
他想赶我走的唯一理由
The only reason he's trying to kick me out

193
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,780
就是因为我结束了这段关系
is because I ended it... 

194
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,140
因为我不想给一个70岁的老头吹箫
because I don't want a 70-year-old dick in my mouth.

195
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,130
闭嘴
Shut up

196
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,050
好好听清楚
and listen.

197
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,490
明天中午之前你必须搬出这个房子
You have until noon tomorrow to vacate the premises.

198
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,270
需要帮你找其它的住处吗
Do you need any help finding other accommodations?

199
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,750
告诉杰瑞他完了  我本来不打算做任何事的
Tell Jerry he blew it. I wasn't gonna do anything.

200
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,240
但现在我改主意了
Now I am.

201
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,250
他当然会那么说了
Of course he'd say that.

202
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,360
他说他准备要对这件事采取行动
He says he's going to do something about it.

203
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,130
做什么  联系个律师吗
What? Contact a lawyer?

204
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,550
麻烦稍等  莎芮瑟
Later, Sharise, please.

205
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,930
我觉得你可能会想见见这个人
I think you may want to deal with this.

206
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,570
加百列·科瓦奇  保罗·约翰逊的代理律师

你好  科瓦奇先生  你好吗
Hello, Mr. Kovac. How are you?

208
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,100
还不错
Okay.

209
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,320
你得多准备些巧克力  少一些薄荷糖

好吧  我记住了

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,820
梅丽莎会参与到我们的谈话

212
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,110
并进行记录  如果你不介意的话
and take notes, if you don't mind.

213
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,160
多来点巧克力  记下来了
More chocolate. Got it.

214
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,590
同样地
Likewise and similarly,

215
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,880
我也要用手机进行录音
I have an iPhone here that I'm gonna record,

216
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,160
如果我能找到录音键的话
if I can, uh, put record on.

217
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,740
-在哪呢  -这里
- Some... - Um, there.

218
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,110
-那个按键  -很好
- That button there. - Oh, great.

219
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,800
谢谢  好了
Thank you. Yeah.

220
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,850
那么
So, um...

221
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,570
我是来代表
I represent

222
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,430
保罗·约翰逊先生的
Mr. Paul Johnson.

223
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,750
你的当事人长期占他的便宜
He has been fucked over by your client.

224
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,680
那是个法律术语吗
Is that a legal term?

225
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,520
占便宜吗
"Fucked over"?

226
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,560
不是  但形容得很准确
No. But it's accurate.

227
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,800
耶利米牧师把他的阴茎
Pastor Jeremiah placed his penis

228
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,060
放到了我当事人身上的两个开口处
in two of my client's orifices.

229
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,730
这么说怎么样
How's that?

230
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,950
你们哈佛教育的精英还满意吗
Hmm? Does that satisfy your Harvard education?

231
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,500
我没去过哈佛上学
I didn't go to Harvard.

232
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,250
我也没有
I didn't either.

233
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,310
你需要明白  提出这个控告
Uh, you do understand that by making this accusation,

234
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,840
卡瓦奇先生  你们可能会引来反诉
Mr. Kovac, that you are inviting a countersuit?

235
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,030
事实上  像这种没有依据的控告
In fact, a baseless accusation of this kind

236
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,190
也会成为非常好的理由
would be grounds to report you to

237
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,750
去向律师登记和纪律委员会举报你
the Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Commission.

238
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,160
洛哈特女士  事情是这样的
Ms. Lockhart, here's the thing.

239
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,830
我不是一个好律师
I'm not a great lawyer.

240
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,150
我考了三次才通过律师资格考试
Took me three tries to pass the bar.

241
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,830
但是我非常明白这一点
But I do know this.

242
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,330
你是被派到这来吓唬我的
You were sent in here to intimidate me,

243
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,730
因为你是典型的白人律师
'cause you're the token white lawyer,

244
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,850
通常都会用那些专业名词  什么纪律处分啊
and use all kinds of words like, uh, "Disciplinary action,"

245
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,930
还有法律诉讼啊
uh, "Court suits,"

246
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,540
想用这些东西把我吓跑
um, things like that that are supposed to scare me off.

247
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,320
我觉得你没有明白这不是关于
I don't think you understand that this isn't about...

248
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,660
我没那么容易被吓跑
I don't scare easy.

249
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,170
而且我对加入高档俱乐部不感兴趣
And, uh, I'm not interested in getting into the right country club.

250
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,890
我现在所知道的就是保罗·约翰逊
All I know is Paul Johnson,

251
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,520
他17岁的时候  被你的当事人
when he was 17 years old, was raped by your client,

252
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,130
一位注册牧师强奸了
a certified pastor.

253
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,250
伊利诺伊州的民法规定
And the Illinois civil statute of limitations

254
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,530
强奸的诉讼时效是20年
for statutory rape is 20 years.

255
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,970
那个是我自己查来的
I looked that up.

256
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,690
我还知道
I also know

257
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,400
你们并不希望这件事上法庭
that you don't want this to go to trial.

258
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,640
耶利米牧师可是一位牧师啊
Pastor Jeremiah is a pastor.

259
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,340
这已经是对他的双重打击
I mean, that's, like, already two strikes against him.

260
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,550
而那些自由党人士会看着他并且认为
And the liberals, they're gonna look at him and think

261
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,830
他会强奸孩子
he rapes kids.

262
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,430
不如你让他在法庭上穿他的牧师服吧
Hey, why don't you have him wear his collar in court,

263
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,850
这样他就肯定完蛋了
and then he'd really be fucked.

264
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,430
你想怎么样  科瓦奇先生
What do you want, Mr. Kovac?

265
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,280
钱
Money.

266
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,230
很多很多钱
And a lot of it.

267
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,480
我们不会接受勒索的
We won't be blackmailed.

268
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,460
不  你们会的
Yes, you will.

269
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,800
我们这也不叫勒索
We won't call it that.

270
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,890
我们称这个为审前和解
We'll call it a pretrial settlement.

271
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,710
对我们来说
And for our purposes...

272
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,900
我刚刚说的勒索都是在开玩笑
I was just joking about the blackmail thing.

273
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,330
我们只是在对审前和解
We are merely having a discussion

274
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,400
进行讨论
about a pretrial settlement.

275
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,600
很高兴认识你们
Nice to meet you.

276
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,280
你上过相亲网站吗
Do you ever go on eHarmony?

277
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,950
没有
No.

278
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,180
太可惜了
Too bad.

279
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,920
你应该去试试
You should try it.

280
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,730
没错
Yep.

281
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,640
我们必须和牧师安排见一面了
We need to arrange a meeting with the pastor.

282
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,560
你有在画廊和陌生人做爱吗
You ever fuck a stranger in an art gallery?

283
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,530
我只在这里和陌生人做爱
Hmm. It's the only place I'd fuck a stranger.

284
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,120
我以为你说这里只会有八个人呢
I thought you said there'd be eight people here.

285
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,630
是啊  刚刚人是不多
Yeah, there were.

286
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,060
你来得有点晚
You're a little late.

287
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,450
好吧  洗手间在哪
Okay. Where's the bathroom?

288
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,830
这只是从我们家洗衣筐里随便找的衣服
Yeah. It's just something I found in my hamper.

289
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,390
我真想住在你的洗衣筐里
Oh, I want to live in your hamper.

290
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,090
快  没人在看我们  吻我
Quick, no one's looking. Kiss me.

291
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,040
科林
Colin?

292
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,960
妈
Mom?

293
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,830
没错  老妈在此  本人驾到
Yes, Mom. Here I am, in the flesh.

294
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,810
介绍一下你朋友吧
Well, who's your friend?

295
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,830
她真是性感上天啊
She's very sexy.

296
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,320
这是我的同事  卢卡
This is my colleague, Lucca.

297
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,600
-卢卡  -奎恩
- Lucca... - Quinn.

298
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,890
-奎恩  卢卡·奎恩  -卢卡·奎恩
- Quinn. Lucca Quinn. - Lucca Quinn.

299
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,520
弗朗西斯卡·拉法特里
Francesca Lovatelli.

300
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,360
你们两个已经滚床单了吗
Are you two sleeping with each other?

301
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,630
-又来了  -我不是喜欢窥探隐私
- Uh, here we go. - I'm not in the habit of prying.

302
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,280
只不过科林从来不告诉我
It's just that Colin never tells me anything

303
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,920
任何有关私生活方面的事
about his personal life.

304
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,020
我也奇怪为什么呢
I wonder why.

305
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,530
我记得你说过会在绿色的画下等我
I thought you said under the green painting.

306
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,600
没错  我之前在啊
Yes, I did,

307
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,530
但看看我找到谁了  我儿子
but look who I found: my son.

308
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,420
你好  克莱伦斯
Hi, Clarence.

309
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,020
你们俩认识
You two know each other?

310
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,470
卢卡  对吗
Lucca, right?

311
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,350
你们没有雇我
You didn't hire me.

312
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,340
抱歉
Sorry.

313
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,760
克莱伦斯  来认识一下我儿子  科林
Clarence, please, meet my son, Colin.

314
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,250
-科林  这是我的新律师  -你好吗
- Colin, this is my new attorney. - Hey, man. How you doing?

315
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,710
妈  你在干什么  在画廊和你的律师约会
Mom, what are you doing? Gallery hopping with your lawyer?

316
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,740
你们看到特朗普干了什么吗
Hey. Did you see what Trump is doing?

317
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,940
我的天啊  这个国家  怎么了
Oh, my God, this country. What happened?

318
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,120
我听说他们在考虑标识出所有的穆斯林
I heard they're thinking of tagging all Muslims.

319
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,950
我知道  用微芯片
I know, microchips.

320
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,930
-我在考虑  成为穆斯林  -不行
- I'm thinking of - becoming Muslim. - No.

321
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,580
你觉得怎么样  卢卡
What do you think about that, Lucca?

322
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,350
你是穆斯林吗  也许你是
Ooh, are you Muslim? Maybe you are.

323
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,710
她不是  妈
Not a Muslim, Mom.

324
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,650
你会来参加明晚的生日派对吗
Well, are you gonna come to the birthday party tomorrow night?

325
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,430
我  什么
I, uh... uh, what?

326
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,560
没错  明天晚上
Yeah, tomorrow night.

327
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,410
-糟了  -生日会  明晚
- Oh. - Birthday party, tomorrow night.

328
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,240
我猜某人忘记告诉我这件事了
Huh. I guess someone forgot to mention it to me.

329
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,060
科林快要32岁了
Colin's 32 years old.

330
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,190
就像耶稣  还有一年就要面临死亡了
Like Jesus, one year away from death.

331
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,880
但他看起来还是像个孩子  看看这皮肤
But he still looks like a baby. Look at that skin.

332
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,370
我想卢卡可能会有点忙  我不
Uh, I think Lucca's probably a little busy. I don't...

333
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,290
没有  没有  我想我可以取消其它的安排
No, no, no. No, I-I think I can break that date.

334
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,750
-真的吗  -谢谢你  卢卡
- Really? - Thank you, Lucca.

335
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,620
我儿子就是这样  不是吗
Isn't that just like my son?

336
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,460
总是试着推开身边的女人
Always trying to push women away.

337
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,640
没错  可不是吗
I know. Isn't that true?

338
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,900
我讨厌他这点
I hate it.

339
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,340
你看到特朗普是怎么说非裔美国人了吗
Did you see what Trump said about African-Americans?

340
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,440
这个律师有证据证明
This lawyer has evidence

341
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,840
你去年付钱给保罗·约翰逊了
of payments you made to Paul Johnson last year.

342
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,320
付了三次  总计9000美元
Three payments, totaling $9,000.

343
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,580
这是真的
That's true.

344
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,790
所以你确实付钱给他了
So you made these payments?

345
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,090
是给保罗的封口费吗
Was it money to silence Paul?

346
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,030
不是
No.

347
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,470
好吧  那是什么
Well, then, what was it?

348
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,710
经文里讲过一位旅人
There's scripture, tells of a traveler,

349
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,540
被抢劫  遍体鳞伤
beaten, robbed,

350
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,410
被扔在路边等死
left at the side of the road.

351
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,230
唯一愿意帮助他的人是撒玛利亚人信徒
The only man to offer help was a Samaritan,

352
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,050
属于敌对的宗教组织
a rival ethnic group.

353
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,410
这个撒玛利亚人信徒关心这位旅人
Now, this Samaritan, he cared for this man.

354
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,740
这便是我做的
That's what I provided.

355
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,340
关心一个需要帮助的人
Care for someone who needed help.

356
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,260
我不能让他把这样的举动说得如此污秽
And I will not let him turn that into something obscene.

357
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,930
你有与他发生过性关系吗
You didn't have a sexual relationship with him?

358
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,840
没有
No.

359
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,320
我唯一做的  只是帮助他振作起来
All I ever did was help him get on his feet.

360
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,450
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

361
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,410
我不相信他  卡尔
I don't believe him, Carl.

362
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,260
因此我知道我们不适合接这案子
And that's how I know we are not the right firm for this case.

363
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,720
你只为相信的人辩护吗
Well, you only defend people that you believe?

364
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,940
如果这案子处理不好
When the other shoe drops,

365
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,170
会有更多保罗找上门来
and more Pauls come forward,

366
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,670
在那时我们会希望从未踏过这趟浑水
we're gonna wish we were nowhere near involved with this.

367
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,080
我们会接下这案子
We are gonna take this case.

368
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,200
这事不能站错边  我们负担不起
We cannot afford to be on the wrong side of this.

369
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,790
你好好想想
Now, think about this:

370
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,670
黑人牧师强奸一位17岁的孩子
black pastor rapes 17-year-old child?

371
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,140
卡尔
Carl.

372
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,500
我要援引公司章程第四条
I'm invoking Article 4.

373
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,500
什么  你说什么
What? Excuse me?

374
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,400
我要求所有正式合伙人投票
I'm demanding a full partnership vote

375
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,080
决定律所的领导人选
on the leadership of this firm.

376
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,580
我们要朝另一个方向走
We're going in another direction.

377
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,630
你就是那个新方向
And you're the new direction.

378
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,850
是这意思吗  你认真的吗
Is that it? Seriously?

379
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,400
没错  我要拿回我的律所
Yeah, I'm taking my firm back.

380
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,010
你在带着它俯冲
You've driven it to the ground,

381
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:00,920
而在当下这种情况
and in this day and age,

382
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,570
我们不能让它走下坡路
we can't afford to let it drift.

383
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,660
你老了  卡尔
You got old, Carl.

384
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,740
而且你现在的行为是在背叛我
And you're betraying me right now.

385
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,350
但你知道吗  我依然尊敬你
But you know what? I still honor you.

386
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,930
尊敬你在过去做过的一切
Everything you've done in the past.

387
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,120
真的
Truly.

388
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,850
但现在你得放手
Now you need to go.

389
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,650
你可以做那些激励人心的演讲
You make those inspirational speeches,

390
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,340
收获属于你的掌声和赞扬
and you take every bit of that applause,

391
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,700
因为那是你应得的
'cause you have earned it.

392
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,900
但在律所未来的走向上
But as far as the future's concerned?

393
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,510
你得放手让我们来做  卡尔
You got to let us take it from here, Carl.

394
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,890
这20年来都不断有人说我老
You know, I've been called old for about 20 years now.

395
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,730
每次有人那样说我的时候
Every time somebody says that to me...

396
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,720
我会笑
I smile.

397
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,580
因为他们其实低估了我
Because they are underestimating me.

398
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,750
但你知道吗
But you know what?

399
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,210
你忘记了我教过你的东西
You forgot the lessons I taught you.

400
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,490
你完全忘记了
You forgot those lessons.

401
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,690
你得小心了
Now you be careful.

402
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,570
你说的这个老人
This old man

403
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,230
会狠狠教训你一顿
may just kick your ass.

404
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,470
我想你应该懂得这种体会
Yeah, I guess you can understand what it feels like to, uh...

405
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,150
律所冠着你的名字  但你却没有职能
have a firm that bears your name that lost your mission.

406
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,140
-我有这样的经历  -没错
- Mm. I've had my experience with that, yes. - Yeah.

407
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,570
所以你可能会明白我要做的事
So maybe you can understand why I'm doing what I'm doing.

408
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,810
所有合伙人会进行一次投票
Now, there's gonna be a full vote of the partners.

409
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,550
我需要你的帮助才能夺回我的律所
And I need your help, so I can get my firm back.

410
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,280
我们曾为了重要的事而奋斗  芭芭拉
We once stood for something important, Barbara.

411
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,660
而我们现在唯一关注的只是能否赚钱
And the only thing we stand for now is making money,

412
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,520
就我而言  这则意味着我们毫无意义
and as far as I'm concerned, that means we stand for nothing.

413
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,290
投我一票  芭芭拉
Vote with me, Barbara.

414
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,650
请一定投我一票
Vote with me, please.

415
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,180
阿德里安也有付出
Adrian, he'll have his input,

416
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,330
但就我而言  他如果是大脑你就是心脏
but he's the head and you're the heart, as far as I'm concerned.

417
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,570
帮助我一起将心摆在最前位
Help me put the heart first.

418
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,770
你知道我们要投票
Now, you know, uh, we're having a vote.

419
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,290
管理合伙人的投票
Managing partner?

420
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,660
我听说了
Yes, I heard.

421
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,470
你帮我查看下形势
Why don't you check out the lay of the land for me,

422
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,360
看看谁给谁投票
see who's voting for who.

423
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,760
我  我不想牵扯进来
I... Look, I don't want to get in the middle of this.

424
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,840
希望你能理解
Uh, I hope you understand.

425
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,160
我知道  我知道
Oh, I know, I know, I know.

426
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,040
那你为何不
Why don't you, uh...

427
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,280
多多留意下动向呢
put your ear to the ground.

428
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,230
雷迪克先生让我调查下这个瘾君子
Mr. Reddick asked me to see what I could find out about this addict

429
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,830
为什么会找耶利米牧师的麻烦
coming after Pastor Jeremiah.

430
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,350
尽管去查
Go ahead and do it.

431
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,430
别花太多计费工时
But not too many billable hours.

432
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,340
明白了
Understood.

433
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,670
他有问过我调查可能的得票数
He did ask me about a likely head count

434
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,990
管理合伙人里谁投了谁
for the vote on managing partner.

435
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,220
这你查起来有困难吗
Is that something you have a problem doing?

436
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,200
没困难
Not at all.

437
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,070
我只是想知道你希望我的调查有多准确
I just wanted to see how accurate you wanted me to be

438
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,990
我才能汇报给他
in what I report back to him.

439
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,270
{\an8}  加百列·科瓦奇办公室  执业律师
请上楼

440
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,280
感谢上帝没让我沦落至此
There but for the grace of God.

441
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,910
洛哈特女士  很高兴见到你
Ms. Lockhart, nice to see you.

442
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,020
欢迎
Welcome.

443

你不是梅丽莎
And... you're not Marissa.

444
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,740
梅丽莎在哪儿
Where is, uh, where is Marissa?

445
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,930
梅丽莎是我的助理
Marissa's my assistant.

446
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,010
这是玛娅
This is Maia.

447
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,670
玛娅  你好
Maia. Hello.

448
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,000
红头发很好看
Pretty red hair.

449
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,760
我有只红头发的狗
I had a dog with red hair.

450
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,450
快请坐  请坐
Uh, please sit down, sit down.

451
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,220
我才玩完一轮糖果消消乐
I am just finishing up a round of Candy Crush.

452
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,500
而这实在...
And this is...

453
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,660
我得玩完这轮  如果没完成的话
I have to finish this, if I don't finish,

454
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,110
我就会有点...
I'm just gonna be a bit of a...

455
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,230
稍等  抱歉
Hold on a second. Sorry.

456
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,070
见鬼了
Goddamn it!

457
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,250
今天不是我的幸运日
Not my day today.

458
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,070
科瓦奇先生
Mr. Kovac,

459
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,760
我们调查了你提过的钱款
we've looked into the payments you told us about,

460
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,550
耶利米牧师寄给保罗那些钱
from Pastor Jeremiah to Paul,

461
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,430
结果很满意  钱款的解释很单纯
and we're satisfied that there is an innocent explanation.

462
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,380
我们不会给约翰逊先生任何和解费
We're not gonna offer Mr. Johnson any money.

463
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,740
这是我们的最后决定
That's final.

464
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,840
是嘛
Really?

465
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,170
你叫什么来着
And who are you again?

466
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,850
玛娅
Maia.

467
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,890
你们总派白人律师过来
You keep sending out white lawyers.

468
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,300
-为什么  -科瓦奇先生
- Why is that? - Yes, Mr. Kovac,

469
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,690
你街头混混式的小聪明很令人印象深刻
we're very impressed with your street smarts.

470
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,770
但到某个时候
But at some point,

471
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,000
你总得停下那套反常青藤的把戏
you have to stop riding the anti-Ivy League thing.

472
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,890
你要么有证据  要么没有
You either have the evidence or not.

473
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,360
好吧  你得解释下
Okay, you'll have to explain this.

474
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,660
这是中途之家内部走廊的监控
This is the security footage from inside the Halfway House.

475
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,000
看看时间标记
And take a look at that time stamp.

476
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,590
耶利米牧师夜里十一点整进了保罗的房间
Pastor Jeremiah goes into Paul's room at 11:00 at night.

477
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,380
出来的时候已经
And he comes back out at...

478
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,130
十一点半
11:30.

479
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,700
期间过了半小时
That's a half hour.

480
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,060
我可能不是那么有礼貌
Yeah, yeah, I may not be polite,

481
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,040
但有些人比你想象中要糟糕许多
but-but people are worse than you expect.

482
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,990
牧师强奸小男孩
Pastors rape little boys!

483
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,580
即使是陈腔滥调也依然会发生
Even clichés happen.

484
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,650
是毒品检测
It was a drug test.

485
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,170
一次只针对保罗的毒品检测吗
A drug test that only targeted Paul?

486
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,290
那晚你没去其他人的房间
You didn't go into anybody else's room that night.

487
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,510
有人报告说保罗  也只有保罗
Well, there was a report that Paul, and only Paul,

488
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,360
大晚上有人拜访  可能是毒贩子
had a late-night visitor, perhaps a drug dealer.

489
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,160
所以我去了他房间做了毒品检测
So I went into his room to give him a drug test.

490
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,730
这是标准流程吗
This was standard procedure?

491
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,670
没错
Yes.

492
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,240
我们在房里就有做检测的设备
We have kits on-site that we use.

493
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,070
我去他房间没别的原因
I wasn't in his room for any other reason.

494
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,320
-能再放一遍吗  -当然可以
- Can you play it again? - Sure.

495
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,820
是牧师要求装监控的
The reverend is the one who put this security video in.

496
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,860
他想确保没人无视规矩
He wanted to make sure no one flaunted the rules.

497
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,170
说他毫无缘由地进人房间  这太疯狂了
It's insane to think he'd go into somebody's room without a reason.

498
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,670
暂停  就这里
Stop. There.

499
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,900
倒回去点
Go back.

500
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
漏了段时间
There's a time jump.

501
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,170
缺了快一小时的监控
You're missing almost an hour of footage.

502
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,930
这不可能
No, th-that can't happen.

503
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,230
但你看  时间标记跳了一小时
But look, the time code, it jumps an hour.

504
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,110
耶利米是个好人
Jeremiah is a good man.

505
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,770
他照顾好我们
He takes care of us.

506
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,060
他甚至会每天早上带我们去远足
He even takes us for long walks every morning.

507
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,920
帮助我们清醒大脑  不重蹈覆辙
It helps us clear our heads, keeps us in shape.

508
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,820
你为什么要说这些
Why are you saying that?

509
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,160
我没说不是这样
I'm not saying any different.

510
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,500
很多人想看虔诚的人被冠以污名
A lot of people want religious people brought down.

511
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,850
他们不喜欢上帝
They don't like God, 

512
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,020
也不喜欢信仰上帝的人
or they don't like people who believe in God.

513
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,390
我只是想弄清楚事情的真相
I just want to know the truth.

514
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,040
去死吧
Then die.

515
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,420
这样你就能知道真相了
That's how you know the truth.

516
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,070
死亡
Die.

517
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,480
上帝会告诉你真相
And God'll tell you.

518
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,300
所以这里少了一小时得录像
So there's an hour missing.

519
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,930
-这意味着什么  -不知道
- What does that mean? - I don't know.

520
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,800
要么是有人在包庇牧师
Now, either someone is covering for the reverend,

521
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,250
要么是保罗·约翰逊和他的律师
or Paul Johnson and his lawyer 

522
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:29,980
不想让我们看见
don't want us to see

523
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,540
-跟他交易的毒贩进了房间  -没错
- that his dealer entered the room. - Yeah.

524
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,510
等等  暂停
Wait, wait, freeze.

525
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,340
这是个笔记本  按一下空格键就行了
It's a laptop; just press the space button.

526
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,030
你想我把画面放大一点吗
Do you want me to enhance?

527
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,230
怎么了
What?

528
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,300
我刚在想我真的很适合干你的工作
I was just thinking I'm pretty good at your job.

529
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,130
我觉得我要去考个侦探证
I think I'll go for a detective license.

530
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,470
恭喜你  到底怎么了
Congratulations. What?

531
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,210
你看见这个没  这是个运动手环
Do you see this? It's a Fitbit.

532
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,360
你登上我的网站就能看见我什么时候在睡觉
When you go on my website, you can find when I was asleep,

533
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,500
什么时候醒着  
when I was awake, 

534
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,360
什么时候在走路  走了多远
when I was walking, how far I went.

535
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,040
看
Look.

536
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,540
好吧
Okay.

537
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,640
我会资助你考侦探证的
I'll sponsor you for a detective's license.

538
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,390
-真的吗  -当然
- Really? - Sure.

539
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,990
告诉我时间
Tell me when.

540
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,020
我不能恢复已经删除了的监控录像
I wasn't able to recover the deleted security footage,

541
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,050
但是梅丽莎发现保罗带了一个健康追踪器
but Marissa noticed Paul was wearing a fitness tracker.

542
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,480
-你好  我是梅丽莎  -你好
- Hi, I'm Marissa. - Hi.

543
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,750
耶利米给中途之家的每个人送了一个
Jeremiah gifted everyone at the halfway house one,

544
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,980
想让他们重视健康的生活方式
putting an emphasis on healthy living.

545
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,960
这个可以监视心率  计步
They monitor your heart rate, count your steps,

546
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,840
诸如此类  我以前觉得这东西很傻
things like that. I used to think they were stupid,

547
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,050
但现在我也带了一个  看见没
but now I have one. See?

548
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,110
牧师建立了一个活动组
Yeah, the reverend set up an activity group

549
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,620
让房客们相互比赛
for the tenants to compete with each other.

550
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,750
也就是说...
Which means...

551
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,850
我们能搞到保罗的所有数据
we have access to all of Paul's data.

552
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,010
这就是保罗的动向
This is what Paul was doing?

553
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,150
也不是所有的  但涵盖了一部分
Oh, well, not everything, but some.

554
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,550
这看上去像是保罗在睡觉  直到...
And it looks like Paul was sleeping until...

555
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,990
{\an8}每日心率

556
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,620
你看见这里他的心率大幅上升了吗
you see that spike there?

557
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,450
这就是在耶利米敲门  叫醒他的时候
That's when Jeremiah knocked on the door, waking him up.

558
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,700
这并不能排除有性行为发生
This still doesn't rule out sex.

559
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,950
比对两人的数据就可以排除了
Not until you compare the data side-by-side.

560
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,940
保罗的心率在缓慢地升高
Paul's heart rate is slowly increasing.

561
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,460
而耶利米的心率在减缓
And Jeremiah's is decreasing.

562
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,190
这不能是两个人在发生性行为
That's not two people having sex.

563
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,540
能允许我失陪一下吗
Would you excuse me one second?

564
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,100
要么是耶利米一边在服用某种药物
Now, either Jeremiah somehow drugged himself 

565
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,500
一边仍能占保罗的便宜  要么是...
and still managed to take advantage of Paul, or...

566
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,490
要么是保罗在撒谎
Or Paul is lying.

567
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,280
艾米  怎么了
Amy, what's wrong?

568
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,700
不知道  也许没事  我联系不上你
I don't know. Maybe nothing. I couldn't get ahold of you.

569
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,320
我爸一直打给我  所以我屏蔽来电了
Dad's been trying to call me, so I've been screening.

570
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,750
是的  他打到家里了  三次
Yeah, he called home. Three times.

571
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,830
每次我挂断  他又打过来  所以我只能接了
Every time I silenced it, he called back, so I had to answer.

572
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,060
他告诉我他一直都视我为家人
He told me he's always considered me family

573
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,330
然后谢谢我对你一直很好
and then thanked me for being so good to you.

574
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,560
-他在啜泣  -什么
- He was sobbing. - What?

575
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,230
听起来很像他在说再见
It sounded like good-bye.

576
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,160
我觉得你应该打给他
I think you should call him.

577
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,860
好吧
Yeah.

578
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,850
我们现在不在家  请留言...
We're not home right now. Please leave a message af...

589
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,710
我知道你在想什么  好吗
I know what you're thinking, okay?

590
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,320
我现在马上赶过来
I'm on my way to you right now.

591
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,440
我们谈谈
Just... let's talk.

592
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,250
爸  我爱你  好吗
Dad, I love you, okay?

593
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,110
我在路上了
I'm on my way.

594
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,380
我很快就到了
I'm gonna be there soon.

595
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,400
别  别挂电话
Just... just don't hang up.

596
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,630
{\an9}*Fly away*

597
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,410
{\an9}*Oh, glory, I'll...*

598
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,910
别挂...
Don't hang up, just...

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,380
听我说

{\an9}*When I die*

601
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,890
{\an9}*Hallelujah, by and by...*

602

打给我妈
Try my mom.

603
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,510
{\an9}*I'll fly away*

604
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:40,450
{\an9}*I'll fly away... Oh, glory*

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,520
{\an9}*I'll fly away...*

606
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,790
她没接
She isn't answering.

607
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,060
打去贾克斯叔叔家

我没有什么见解
I don't really have an opinion.

661
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,800
但是问题不是这个  问题是艺术

662

Dad, don't ever do that, okay? Ever! - Maia,

701
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,250
如果他们认为我试图自杀
if they think I tried to commit suicide,

702
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,470
他们就会撤销我的保释

708
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,810
所以我只是摔倒了

709
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,850
-你摔倒了  -对的

你当时只是在检查屋顶  结果你摔倒了

我需要你让这里看起来一切正常

告诉医护人员他摔倒了  好吗

718
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,650
-完美  -你觉得恐同的
- Perfect. - Do you think it's all right

719
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,780
说唱歌词可以用文化因素来开脱
that rap lyrics are homophobic,

720
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,440
这样没问题吗
because it's cultural?

721
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,120
我不知道  克莱伦斯
I don't know, Clarence.

722
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,730
好吧  对了  祝贺你

在他的仕途上支持他
Being on his arm as he runs for office.

726
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,160
就像白思豪一样
It's like de Blasio.

727
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,230
{\an8}白思豪为现任纽约市长

728
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,210
这不仅对他而言有利  对你亦然
Doesn't just work for him, it works for you.

729
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,340
好吧  我不太明白你在说什么
Okay, I don't understand a word you're saying.

730
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,300
他们将推举科林为参议员
They're gonna run Colin for senator.

731
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,800
这就是他担任助理联邦检察官的原因
That's why he's working as an AUSA.

732
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,460
这是成为参议员的跳板
It's a stepping stone to office.

733
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,510
你也一样
So are you.

734
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,510
有一个性感黑妞做女朋友
The hot black girlfriend?

735
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,940
这可是吸票的梦想组合
It's a demographic dream.

736
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,500
问问白思豪就知道了
Ask de Blasio.

737
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,600

Thanks.

738
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,980

替我给你的父母道歉
Apologize to your parents for me.

744
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,940
律师就是这样的  对吧
Work of a lawyer, right?

745
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
科林  快来

*生日快乐  亲爱的科林*
*Happy birthday, dear Colin...*

747
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,720
我  我当时在想
I-I was thinking...

748
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,260
分诊护士去诊所
Triage nurse to E.R.

749
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,770
-我的天  亨利  -我的天哪
- Oh, my God, Henry. - Oh, my gosh.

750
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,480

What were you doing?

751
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,110

我没事  真的  真没事
I'm fine. It's nothing, really. It's-it's... It's nothing. 

754
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,640
你的腿
It's your leg.

755
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,990
你的背  都受伤了
And your back. I-It's everything.

756
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,700
我的天  如果我失去了你
Oh, my God, if I lost you,

757
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,260
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what I'd do.

758
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,100
还有你当时怎么在那儿
And what were you doing there?

759
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,640

761
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,020
如果他  如果他在那儿躺一整晚
If he, if he had been lying there all night...

762
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,980
你让贾克斯带你来的吗
You had Jax bring you here?

763
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,810
我  我不想等出租车
I d... I didn't, I didn't want to wait for a cab.

764
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,840
我自己又太心烦意乱  开不了车
I was too upset to drive myself.

765
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,940
你不能再这样了  妈妈
You have to end it, Mom.

766
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,820
贾克斯送我来这里又怎么样
What difference does it make if Jax drove me here?

767
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,580
你听到我刚才说的话了吗
Did you hear what I just said?

768
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,860
你不能再这样了
You have to end it.

769
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,850
不能怎么样
End what?

770
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,570
别装了
Stop that.

771
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,300
你懂我的意思
You know what I mean.

772
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,190
不管你怎么想我和你叔叔
Whatever you think you know about your uncle and I...

773
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,760
我怎么想不重要
It doesn't matter what I think.

774
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,830
重要的是我爸怎么想
It's what my father thinks.

775
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,680
你怎么知道他的想法
How do you know what he thinks?

776
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,660
什么
What...

777
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,620
"我写下这封信  并非是以委屈的心情
"I don't write this out of feeling wronged,

778
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,370
尽管我的妻子与我弟弟睡了
that because my wife slept with my brother,

779
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,130
我不觉得他们亏欠了我
I'm owed something.

780
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,590
是我背叛了我的妻子
It's I who's cheated my wife...

781
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,130
出于一种
out of what it feels like

782
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,840
被人所爱而回报以爱的心情"
to be loved by someone you love in return."

783
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,480
这是什么
What is that?

784
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,500
"我也背弃了我女儿
"Just like I've cheated my daughter of

785
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,230
我没能让她抬起头来
being able to hold her head up

786
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,710
她还是要为那些过错付出代价
and not be held accountable for the mistakes...

787
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,590
为她父亲犯下罪行付出代价
The crimes... of her father.

788
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:24,590
这两人是这世上我最爱的人
I love these two people more than anyone in the world.

789
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,730
我只想让她们开心幸福
I just want them to be happy,

790
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,820
实现这一点的最佳办法就是我的离开
And the best chance of that happening is for me to clear out

791
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,740
对她们放手"
and let them."

792
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,330
他让我发誓不告诉你他想自杀的事
He made me swear I wouldn't tell you he tried to do it.

793
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,840
你什么也不能说
You can't say anything.

794
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,560
亨利怎么样了
How's Henry?

795
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,030
走开
Go away.

796
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,160
-我只是想要确认一下  -滚开
- I just want to check... - Go away.

797
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,020
还有六个小时就要投票了
Look, with the vote six hours away,

798
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,330
这就是我们的立场
here's where we stand.

799
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,000
伊夫林说她的预算拨款太"吝啬"了
Evelyn says her expense allowance is "Stingy."

800
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,380
-吝啬  -她想增加预算
- Stingy. - She'd like an increase.

801
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,800
马克觉得律所已经脱离争取民事权利的根基了
And Mark feels the firm has lost track of its civil rights roots.

802
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,470
我喜欢雷迪克先生的说话方式
I love how Mr. Reddick talks.

803
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,760
真的
Truly.

804
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,820
但是我们得有资本允许
But we do more good in the world,

805
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,440
才能在这世上能做更多的好事
we have the capital to do good.

806
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,950
特朗普的美国一定不是我的美国  你呢
Trump's America sure ain't my America. Is it yours?

807
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,830
不  我们必须继续斗争
No, we got to keep on fighting.

808
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,250
如今我们正在挣更多的钱
So now that we're making more money, 

809
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,030
我们不需要在预算开支上吝啬
we don't have to be so stingy on the expense accounts.

810
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,570
就像在塞尔玛那时一样  明白吗
That's the way we felt like in, uh, Selma, you know?

811
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,180
我们发现
We figured it out

812
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,620
有一个更容易的方法
there's an easier way to live.

813
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,380
我们每个人的力量
Each one of us

814
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,110
比不上我们团结的力量
is not as strong as we are collectively.

815
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,280
对吗
Right?

816
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,460
我说的够清楚吗  这不是什么难理解的事
Is that fair enough? That's not rocket science.

817
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,250
我后面的那位绅士
Yeah, the gentleman behind me...

818
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,800
抱歉
Sorry.

819
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:40,440
{\an8}个人健康报告

820
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,640
正如你所见  科瓦奇先生
As you can see, Mr. Kovac,

821
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,310
这些是两个健康跟踪器的显示结果
these are the readouts from the two fitness trackers...

822
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,780
我讨厌这些东西
I hate this thing.

823
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,600
并且呼吸并不一致
...and the breathing doesn't match.

824
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,870
你当事人的心率正在上升
Your client's heart rate is increasing,

825
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,390
而耶利米牧师的心率在下降
and Pastor Jeremiah's is decreasing.

826
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,170
这表示他们之间没有发生性关系
That is not indicative of sexual relations.

827
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,100
我的天  败给你了
Oh, my God, you got me.

828
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,140
如果我是你  我会放弃诉讼  先生
If I were you, I would drop this suit, sir,

829
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,580
不然你会面临一场灾难性的反诉
or you'll be facing a devastating countersuit.

830
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,160
你知道你唯一的缺陷吗  戴安
You know the only problem you have, Diane?

831
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,180
有话就说
I can't wait.

832
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,240
保罗能够认出牧师阴茎上
Paul can identify a distinguishing mark

833
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,240
一个明显的标志
on the good pastor's dick.

834
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,250
这就表示他们发生了性关系
Now that is indicative of sexual relations.

835
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,540
你还想要反诉并把这一点提上公开法庭吗
You still want to countersue and take this to open court?

836
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,600
想的话就说
You just let me know.

837
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,880
我不会脱裤子的
I will not disrobe.

838
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,160
要证明他错了  这是最容易的方法  雷夫
It's the easiest way to prove him wrong, Rev.

839
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,180
你阴茎上没有胎记吗
Now you don't have a birthmark on your penis?

840
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
没有
No, I don't.

841
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,380
-所以他在说谎  -当然
- So he's lying? - Yes.

842
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,240
困难的是  牧师先生
The difficulty is, Pastor, 

843
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,260
如果你不肯脱下裤子证明
if you don't disrobe,

844
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,960
这就给人做贼心虚的感觉
this will make you look guilty.

845
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,490
我明白
I understand that.

846
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,920
我不会脱裤子的
I am not disrobing.

847
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,820
你可以带一个相机
You can take the camera

848
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,840
照张照片就好
and take a photo of yourself.

849
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,240
我这一辈子都在抗争
I spent my whole life fighting,

850
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,210
为我们祖先不曾拥有的尊严而抗争
fighting for the dignity that was denied our forebears.

851
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,110
他们曾遭受的是这样的待遇
They were treated like this.

852
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,790
而我不会
I will not be.

853
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,660
这就是他所指望的
That's what he's counting on,

854
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,080
这个无足轻重的小人物
this little, uh... pissant.

855
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,470
他在敲诈你  他指望着
He is blackmailing you, and he's counting on the fact

856
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:21,000
你太过骄傲而不去证明他在说谎
that you have too much pride to prove that he's a liar.

857
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,350
他很聪明  也很正确
Then he's smart, and accurate,

858
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,730
因为我不会
because I won't.

859
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,280
那么我认为你应该付钱给他
Then I think you should pay him.

860
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,880
他会毁了你的名声的  牧师
He's gonna ruin your reputation, Reverend.

861
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,850
所有你为之抗争的尊严
All that dignity that you fought for,

862
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,430
都会像这样消失
it will disappear just like that.

863
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,370
你相信他吗
Do you believe him?

864
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,590
问题不是我相信什么
It's not about what I believe,

865
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,780
而是我们能证明什么
it's about what we can prove.

866
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,450
我问的不是这个
That's not what I asked.

867
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,290
牧师
Reverend...

868
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,150
我在这个圈子呆了很久
I have been around too long to know better than

869
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,800
我深刻了解英雄不是完美的道理
to expect anything from my heroes other than feet of clay.

870
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,160
不管怎样我都不在乎
I don't care one way or the other.

871
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,950
我只想打败这个混蛋
I just want to beat this son of a bitch.

872
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,500
这个健康追踪器与能追踪你路线的
The fitness tracker links to an app

873
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,350
应用程序相连  就像这样
which tracks your routes, like this.

874
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,370
这是我  在办公室里跑来跑去
That's me, running around the office,

875
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,600
告诉助理们他们的老板
talking to all of the assistants about 

876
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,720
-给谁投票  -然后呢
- who their bosses are voting for. - And?

877
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,200
我获取了保罗·约翰逊过去两个月的
I was able to pull up Paul Johnson's tracking data

878
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,630
路径数据
for the past two months.

879
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,680
保罗慢跑的路线很随意
When Paul goes jogging, it's fairly random.

880
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,440
任意两条路线都不一样
No two routes appear to be the same.

881
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,400
但大约两周前  路线形成了一个模式
But about two weeks ago, a pattern started to emerge.

882
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,590
每周两三次
Two or three times a week, 

883
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,670
保罗中途会在科瓦奇的办公室停留
Paul's routes included a pit stop at Kovac's office.

884
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,160
这很正常  他是他的律师
Well, that makes sense; he's his lawyer.

885
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,850
不  在我们给他送驱逐令之前
No. Paul didn't claim to have a lawyer

886
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,940
保罗没有律师
until we served him the eviction notice.

887
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,880
很好
Good.

888
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,060
我们需要对科瓦奇深入调查
We need to look deeper into Kovac.

889
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,180
任何诉讼案件  犯罪记录
Any lawsuits, past crimes.

890
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,390
看看能发现什么
See what you can find.

891
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,990
-完美的时机  -是的
- Perfect timing. - Yeah.

892
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:43,980
斯坦维女士
Uh, Ms. Stanway?

893
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,070
什么事
Yes?

894
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,700
您好  我们是雷迪克&博斯曼律所的
Hi. We're from the law firm Reddick/Boseman.

895
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,830
我们想问您几个有关
We were wondering if we can ask you

896
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,890
加百列·科瓦奇的问题
a few questions about Gabe Kovac.

897
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,950
有记录显示您几年前因侵犯人身罪起诉他
Records show you sued him for an assault a few years back.

898
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,720
是的  我们和解了然后我撤诉了
Yeah, we settled and I dropped the charges.

899
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,570
能告诉我们发生了什么事吗
Can you tell us what happened?

900
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,550
抱歉  我签了保密协议
I'm sorry. I signed a nondisclosure agreement.

901
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,080
如果我们保证不对别人说呢
What if we promise not to tell?

902
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,590
也许能行呢
Hey, you never know.

903
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,950
抱歉  失陪了
Sorry. If you'll excuse me. 

904
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,550
科瓦奇为什么让你签保密协议
Uh, Why would Kovac have you sign an NDA? 

905
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,780
不是他让我签的  是他的律师
He didn't. His lawyer did.

906
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,620
而且不是和他签的
And it wasn't with him.

907
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,370
是和他的雇主  第一宪章之选
It was with his employer, First Charter Choice.

908
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,540
-第一宪章之选  -那是什么
- First Charter Choice. - What's that?

909
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,040
一个另类右翼组织
It's an alt-right cause.

910
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,070
我漏掉什么了吗
Okay, am I missing something?

911
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,400
没有  是我漏掉了什么
No, but I was.

912
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,470
-你在给谁打电话  -阿德里安

进来吧  先生们
Oh. Uh, come on in, gentlemen.

919
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,970
我想你们是终于醒悟过来
So, I guess you finally came to your senses,

920
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,370
准备和解了
and are ready to settle.

921
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,630
你到底知不知道律师注册和纪律委员会
Are you at all familiar with 

922
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,730
道德准则第1.7条  科瓦奇先生
Rule 1.7 of the ARDC code of Ethics, Mr. Kovac?

923
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,910
距离我参加律师资格考试有段时间了
It's been a while since I studied for the bar.

924
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,550
要不  要不你给我总结一下
Why don't, uh... why don't you sum it up for me.

925
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:49,210
律师和当事人之间的利益冲突
Conflicts of interest between attorneys and their clients

926
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,140
可能导致被取消律师资格
may result in disbarment.

927
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,130
我和保罗之间有利益冲突吗
Do I have a kind of conflict of interest with Paul?

928
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,520
我们得知你和塞尔柯克先生的
We're aware that you have done business with, uh,

929
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,370
右翼法律基金会有生意往来
Mr. Selkirk's right-wing legal foundation,

930
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,390
第一宪章之选
First Charter Choice.

931
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,760
我们还得知塞尔柯克为了给这位优秀的牧师
And we're also aware that Selkirk subsidized this "Lawsuit,"

932
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,660
找麻烦而资助了这次"诉讼"
to embarrass the good reverend.

933
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,900
你拿了右翼势力的钱  科瓦奇先生
You're taking money from the alt-right, Mr. Kovac,

934
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,910
而且你把视频中毒品贩子的部分删除了
and you edited the drug dealer from that video.

935
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:10,830
你知道吗
You know what?

936
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,010
我想我们
I think we're, uh...

937
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,130
我们可以结束了
we're about done here.

938
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,340
而且我们准备对你和你的当事人
And we are prepared to file a civil suit against you

939
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,120
的敲诈勒索提起民事诉讼
and your client... for extortion!

940
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,320
祝你今天愉快
Have a good day, now!

941
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,390
你为什么不接我电话
Why aren't you answering my calls?

942
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,510
我一直很忙
I've been busy.

943
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,190
我的家人很疯狂
My family is insane.

944
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,690
不然你觉得为什么我不早点把你介绍给他们
Why do you think I didn't introduce you to them earlier?

945
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,260
这与你的家人无关
This isn't about your family.

946
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,110
问题在于我们的关系  它走到头了
It's about this relationship. It's run its course.

947
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,750
我不这么认为
I disagree.

948
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,570
那是你的权利
That's your right.

949
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,920
我不知道你在寻找什么  但我不是她
I'm not sure what you're looking for, but I'm not her.

950
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:59,300
我不是附属品  不是战利品
I'm not an accessory, I'm not a... trophy.

951
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,010
我也确信我不是妻子
I'm sure as hell not a wife.

952
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,750
我从未那样对待你
And I never treated you that way.

953
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,470
如果有人这样做了  我不会让他留在我身边
And if anyone ever does, they have no place in my life.

954
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,770
你把这件事小题大做了
You're making this a bigger deal than it needs to be.

955
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,350
我不喜欢你的语气
I don't like your tone.

956
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,430
我没有什么语气
There is no tone.

957
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:14,860
我们相处得很愉快
We had fun.

958
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,440
我们都知道这种关系不会维持一辈子
Both knew it wasn't for life.

959
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,810
我们不会"维持一辈子"
We don't do "For life."

960
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,800
我得走了
I have to go.

961
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,250
伊玛尼要投给雷迪克
Imani's voting for Reddick, 

962
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,520
但卡尔文·司德瑞  尤妮斯和托米·内维尔支持你
but you have Calvin Story, Eunice and Tommy Neville.

963
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,330
我算过了  你领先一票
By my count, you're up one.

964
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,320

Carl.

969

朱利叶斯·凯恩要离开律所了
Julius Cain is leaving the firm.

970
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,120
他没有资格投票
He is ineligible to vote.

971
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,480
第12条第四小节规定
Article 12, Subsection D puts forth

972
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,980
合伙人直至任职最后一天都有权
that full voting rights will remain in force

973
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,010
享有其完整投票权
through the last day of the partner's pay period,

974
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,820
我确信是周四才离职
which I believe is Thursday.

975
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,520
那么我们要开始
Well, then shall we commence, uh,

976
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,210
投票了吗
casting the ballots?

977
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:37,040
阿德里安11票  卡尔12票
11 for Adrian and 12 for Carl.

978
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,090
我想做民意调查
I want the room polled.

979
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,670
为什么  你输了
For what reason? You lost.

980
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,550
我想投票开除阿德里安·博斯曼
I want to vote for the removal of Adrian Boseman.

981
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:46,510
等等
Wait.

982
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,590

但我现在想投票了
But I want to now.

984
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,370
-太晚了  -不晚
- Eh, it's too late. - No, it's not.

985
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,780
卡尔
Carl,

986
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,620
你说过这是律所的心脏和头脑之争
you said this was a battle between the firm's heart and its head.

987
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:00,850
但并不是
But it's not.

988
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,180
这是过去和未来之争
It's about the past or the future.

989
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,190
你曾经的辉煌让我们受教  但是
Your past glories have a lot to teach us, but this... 

990
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,510
这关乎现在
this is now.

991
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,420
斗争存在于当下  而阿德里安知道如何抗争
The fights are now, and Adrian knows how to fight them.

992
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,510

993
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:27,460

打成平手了
We're split.

995

是的
Yep.

996
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,940
各占一半
50/50.

997
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,010
这会很有意思
This should be fun.

998
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,180
这就是当今世界的问题  对吧
Hmm. That's the problem with the world today, huh?

999
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:39,570
你认为当下的斗争不一样了
You think the fights are different now.

1000
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:40,810
但你错了
But you're wrong.

1001
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,000
他们是一模一样的
They're exactly the same.

1002
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,580
喝一杯吗
May I?

1003
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,690
敬理想主义
To idealism.

1004
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,690
也敬实用主义
And pragmatism.

1005
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,610
{\an9}*They don't even feel like*

1006
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,540
{\an9}*Like going home*

1007
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,140
{\an9}*Yoo-hoo, well, boy, we'll stop along our way.*
