{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

17
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,660
你人在这里  就得工作  不允许想家
When you work here, you don't think about home

18
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,110
-想亲人想孩子  -这不公平
- and families and babies. - That's not fair.

19
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,710
他不可能提前一年知道要生孩子...
He couldn't have known he was gonna have a baby a year--

20
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,900
我告诉你  斯蒂芬妮
Let me tell you something, Stephanie.

21
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,050
也许你不清楚生孩子的事
Maybe you don't know how babies are made,

22
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,660
因为想要孩子的人  就知道自己在尝试
because when people are trying, they know they're trying!

23
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,160
就因为没人愿意和你尝试
And just because no one ever wants to try with you

24
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,470
不代表你就有权
doesn't give you the right

25
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,600
教我怎么管理新律师
to tell me how to run my associates!

26
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,800
他们提出的是我这辈子都拿不到的钱
I got an offer for more money than I'll see my whole life,

27
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,350
结果你却想让我拒绝就因为你感觉
and you want me to turn it down based on a feeling

28
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,350
发生在克里斯身上的事也发生在了别人身上
that whatever happened to Chris happened to other people?

29
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,240
你在和自己的心理医生约会
You're dating your therapist.

30
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,830
我不需要你对我说教  路易
I don't need a lecture from you, Louis.

31
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,020
唐娜知道你俩的事吗
Does Donna have any idea about the two of you?

32
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,500
她不知道
No, she doesn't,

33
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,370
目前我想保持这种状态
and for right now, I'd like to keep it that way.

34
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,980
你还瞒着我什么  哈维
Harvey, is there something that you're not telling me?

35
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,870
最近觉得你变了个人
'Cause it seems like you've been different lately.

36
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,980
我们赢了  你就是躺在墨西哥沙滩上的
We win this, you're gonna be Andy Dufresne

37
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,480
安迪・杜佛兰
sitting on a beach in Mexico

38
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,150
带着一个满满的钱包
with a bank account full of cash.

39
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,890
我在这里本来过的就不错
I already make a nice living in here.

40
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,080
但我觉得这笔钱的一部分
I was thinking maybe some of that money

41
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,950
可以给你女儿
might go to your daughter.

42
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,520
我确实是在跟奥利佛办案
I wasn't lying about working a case with Oliver.

43
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,980
我只是没告诉你是哪件
I just didn't tell you which one.

44
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,450
-监狱案  -是的
- The prison one? - Yeah.

45
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,320
-这是要被辞退的  -哈维不会就为这解雇...
- This is a fireable offense. - Harvey isn't gonna fire me.

46
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,300
-但也许他应该  -你怎么这么说
- Yeah, but maybe he should. What is your word worth?

47
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,570
就目前的看来  它已经快要一文不值了
The way things are going, it's not gonna be worth very much.

48
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,270
你起来多久了
How long have you been up?

49
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,180
有一阵了
A while.

50
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,630
我一直在想你昨晚对我说的话
I've been thinking about what you said to me last night.

51
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,810
迈克  我没想说得那么过分的
Mike, I didn't mean to be so harsh.

52
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,060
不  你说得对
No, you were right.

53
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,120
我的承诺对我的确非常重要
My word does mean everything to me...

54
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,150
所以我要继续帮助奥利弗
which is why I'm gonna keep helping Oliver.

55
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,420
什么
What?

56
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,890
我向哈维做保证时  我是真心的
When I gave my word to Harvey, I meant it.

57
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,310
但之前  我也向奥斯卡・雷耶斯做了保证
But before that, I gave my word to Oscar Reyes.

58
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,540
对不起  但我现在不能退出
And I'm sorry, but I-I can't back out now.

59
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,680
好吧
Okay.

60
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,720
那么你又要在秘密中生活了
So you're just gonna live your life keeping secrets again?

61
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,340
-不是像那样的  -怎么不像了
- This isn't like that. - How is it not like that?

62
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,490
你在瞒着哈维
You're keeping this from Harvey.

63
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,050
哈维也瞒过杰西卡一些事
And Harvey kept things from Jessica.

64
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,740
结果如何呢
Look at how that turned out.

65
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,910
我现在告诉哈维  就跟他抓到我一样
I tell Harvey now, and it's the same as if he catches me.

66
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,000
案子被驳回  所有我们想帮助的人
The case gets tossed, and all of the people

67
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,450
会继续遭到不公对待
we're trying to help keep getting abused.

68
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,470
跟之前一样
It's the same as before.

69
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,700
不  瑞秋  这跟我是个骗子时不一样
No, Rachel, this is not the same as when I was a fraud.

70
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,900
我还告诉你
And I'll tell you something else--

71
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,960
我以前晚上会睡不着
I used to have trouble sleeping at night,

72
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,560
但我现在睡得很香
but I sleep like a baby now

73
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,470
因为我在帮助他们
because I am helping these people.

74
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,470
对不起  但我要遵守这个承诺
I'm sorry, but that's the word that I'm keeping.

75
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,720
早上好
Good morning.

76
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,000
你睡得好吗
Did you sleep well?

77
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,300
如果八小时的安眠算睡得好
If you consider eight hours of bliss sleeping well,

78
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,880
那么是的  我睡得很好
then, yes, I slept very well.

79
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,500
但现在  我得走了
But now I have to go.

80
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,580
-等等  -哈维  我还要见病人
- Wait. - Harvey, I have patients.

81
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,960
我知道  但我听听你的意见
I know, but I wanted to get your opinion on something.

82
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,960
你又做什么了
What have you done this time?

83
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,720
我还没告诉唐娜我们在约会
I haven't told Donna we're seeing each other yet.

84
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,290
为什么不
Why not?

85
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,160
拜托  你知道我跟她的历史
Come on, you know my history with her.

86
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,350
我们一起工作  我刚提拔了她
We're working together. I just promoted her.

87
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,390
这更多是借口不是理由  不是吗
That's more an excuse than a reason, isn't it?

88
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,300
我不想在没有问题时制造问题
I don't want to create a problem when there isn't one.

89
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,630
谁说非得有问题了
And who says there has to be one?

90
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,780
不非得有  但是...
There doesn't have to be one, but--

91
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,650
哈维  首先  你可能低估了她
Harvey, first of all, you may be underestimating her.

92
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,290
-唐娜已经是个大姑娘了  -宝拉...
- I mean, Donna's a big girl. - Paula--

93
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,730
其次  如果我错了
And second of all, if I'm wrong

94
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,070
你没低估她
and you're not underestimating her,

95
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,900
那等她回头自己发现
then you're only gonna cause both of you

96
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,270
事情只会更糟
a lot more trouble down the road when she finds out.

97
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,280
因为  哈维  她肯定会发现的
'Cause, Harvey, she is gonna find out.

98
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,330
所以你是让我告诉她
So you're telling me to tell her?

99
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,410
你已经知道你需要做什么了
You already know what you need to do.

100
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,380
你问我  是因为有时
You just asked me because sometimes 

101
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,070
我们得听别人说出来
we need to hear it from someone else.

102
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,310
他们没说你还带了助手来
They didn't tell me you brought a sidekick.

103
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,600
弗兰克  这是奥利佛・格雷迪
Frank, this is Oliver Grady.

104
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,860
他是庭审律师
He's the one that's trying the case.

105
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,730
真厉害
Good for him.

106
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,250
我还是不明白你回来做什么
I still don't know what you're doing back here.

107
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,780
我知道的都告诉你了
I already told you everything I know.

108
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,730
不是一切  你该把消息源告诉我们了
Not everything. It's time you gave us the name of your source.

109
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,330
交易是  钱汇入我女儿的账户
The deal is that money goes into my daughter's account,

110
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,650
然后告诉你们名字
then you get the name.

111
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,790
-这是什么  -定金
- What the hell is this? - It's a down payment.

112
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,530
定金  不行
Down payment? I don't think so.

113
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,770
-我要全款  -如果你以为
- I want the whole thing. - And if you think

114
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,330
我们没拿到名字就会给你50万
we're giving you half a million without a name,

115
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,340
那你是疯了
then you're out of your mind.

116
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,190
那我们就陷入了所谓的僵局
Then we are at what they call an impasse,

117
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,440
因为没有钱  我不会告诉你名字
because I'm not giving you that name without that money.

118
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,790
如果案子被法官驳回
And there isn't gonna be any money

119
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,990
就不会有钱了
if the judge dismisses this case.

120
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,390
他在说什么
What the hell is he talking about?

121
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,600
他在说另一边提出动议
He's talking about the fact that the other side

122
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,790
撤销案件
filed a motion to dismiss this thing.

123
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,000
明天上庭
Goes to court tomorrow.

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,280
如果你不把消息源告诉我
If you don't give me the name of your source,

125
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,080
案子就要完了
it's gonna get tossed.

126
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,960
扯淡  才不会
Bullshit it's gonna get tossed.

127
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,980
我都承认我参与了
I already admitted to you I took part in it.

128
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,950
不够
It's not enough.

129
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,910
为什么不够  有我的证言
Why is that not enough? You got my word.

130
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,410
我们不能证实你的证言
We got no corroboration of your word.

131
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,940
谁知道不是我来找你时
What's to say you didn't make up this whole thing

132
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,060
你临时编的
when I came in here?

133
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,860
那去找我七年前找过的
Then go to the goddamn prosecutor

134
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,420
那个检察官
I went to seven years ago.

135
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,570
她都记录下来了
She's got it all on record.

136
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,050
她不是没往下查吗
I thought she didn't pursue this case.

137
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,220
那你听错了
Then you didn't hear me right.

138
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,970
她查了  但是没有做到底
She pursued it. She just didn't want to see it through.

139
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,190
去问她我说的是不是真的
Ask her if I'm telling the truth.

140
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,570
现在  留着你们的零钱吧
In the meantime, keep your pocket change,

141
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,480
因为我什么都不会说的
'cause you're not getting shit from me.

142
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,180
*看到钱  就愿意留下吃饭*
*See the money, wanna stay for your meal*

143
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,560
*给你太太再拿块馅饼*
*Get another piece of pie for your wife*

144
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,910
*所有人都想知道那感觉*
*Everybody wanna know how it feel*

145
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,220
*所有人都想见见那景象*
*Everybody wanna see what it's like*

146
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,530
*豆子馅饼我也愿吃  我不在乎*
*I'll even eat a bean pie, I don't mind*

147
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,520
*我和妹子忙着赚钱*
*Me and Missy is so busy, busy making money*

148
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,610
*好了*
*All right*

149
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,780
*退开点  我要跳舞*
*All step back, I'm 'bout to dance*

150
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,490
*美钞爵士摇摇摇*
*The greenback boogie*

{\an8}诉讼双雄 第七季 第六集

152
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,130
伙计
Hey, buddy.

153
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,520
路易  我只是在泡咖啡
Louis, I was just making a cup of coffee.

154
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,190
我不是在休息  我发誓
I'm not taking any time off, I swear.

155
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,110
布莱恩  偶尔休息一下没什么不好
Whoa, Brian, it's okay to take a break every now and then.

156
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,250
-是吗  -当然了
- It is? - Yeah, absolutely.

157
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,710
事实上  咖啡准备非常重要
In fact, coffee preparation is very important.

158
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,170
是啊  其实泡咖啡是我最喜欢的事...
Yeah. Actually, making coffee is one of my favorite hobb--

159
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,130
太好了  听我说  我有事要问你
That's great. Listen to me, I need to ask you something.

160
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,700
那天  我对你说那些话时
The other day when I said those things to you

161
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,350
关于休假的事
about taking time off, I mean,

162
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,620
我不记得你是不是还记得
I don't even know if you remember it. 

163
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,640
历历在目
Like it was yesterday.

164
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,390
那样的话  我想问
Well, in that case I was just wondering...

165
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,480
我当时多过分
how bad was I?

166
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,550
也不是那么糟糕啦
You weren't that bad.

167
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,720
很好
Good.

168
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,510
你愿意在法庭上这么说吗
Now, would you be willing to swear to that in court?

169
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,070
-什么  为什么  -没为什么
- What? Why? - No reason.

170
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,210
事实上  我对当时的印象和你的一样
Truth is, my recollection is exactly the same as yours.

171
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,440
你想休几天假  我批准了
You asked for a couple days off, and I gave it to you.

172
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,000
瞧  我甚至把它写在了日记里
See, I even wrote it in my diary.

173
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,110
"给布莱恩放了两天假  感觉棒极了"
"Gave Brian two days off. Felt good about it."

174
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,520
这看上去像是今天写的
It looks like you just wrote that today.

175
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,310
-为什么这么说  -顶上的日期是今天
- What makes you say that? - It has today's date on top.

176
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,620
我今天刚写下来是为了记住今天的谈话
I just wrote that down to remember today's conversation.

177
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,800
我能回去工作了吗
Can I go back to work now?

178
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,850
去吧  尽快把你的书面证词放我桌上
Yep, just make sure you have the affidavit on my desk as soon as possible.

179
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,330
谢谢你这么快就见我们  兰道夫女士
Thanks for seeing us on such short notice, Ms. Randolph.

180
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,430
不得不承认  弗兰克・加洛这个名字
I have to say, when I heard the name Frank Gallo,

181
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,800
勾起了我的兴趣
my interest was piqued.

182
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,180
有什么事
What's this about?

183
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,760
我们是一群囚犯起诉
We're representing a class of prisoners

184
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,080
改造公司虐囚的诉讼代理人
suing Reform Corporation for abusive practices.

185
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,040
我们来这里是为了证实
We're here to confirm that

186
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,920
弗兰克・加洛七年前来见过你
Frank Gallo came to see you seven years ago

187
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,490
并且承认自己卷入了一起阴谋
and admitted to being involved in a conspiracy.

188
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,690
没错  他来找我  自荐为线人
Yeah, he came to me offering to be an informant

189
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,070
想以此换取保护
in exchange for protection

190
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,540
不被兰伯特里发生的事殃及
from what was going on in Lambert.

191
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,340
你相信他告诉你的事吗
And did you believe what he told you?

192
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,000
我当然相信  他被打了
Of course I believed him. He was beaten up,

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,080
在医务室里整整待了两周
and he'd been in the infirmary for two goddamn weeks.

194
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,880
如果你真相信他
Well, if you believed him,

195
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,320
为什么不追查这个案子
why the hell didn't you pursue the case?

196
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,810
我查了  我把它捅到了最上面
I did pursue it. I ran it up the flagpole,

197
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,700
但最终却重重地砸回了我身上
and it came back down like a concrete block.

198
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,330
没人在乎那些囚犯和他们的遭遇
No one gives a shit about prisoners or the way they're treated.

199
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,790
所以他另外提出告他狱友的密
So, instead, he offered to inform on his fellow inmates,

200
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,080
然后借此机会转狱
and then he used that to get himself transferred.

201
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,870
没错  好了  你们不介意的话
Exactly. Now, if you don't mind.

202
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,730
丹妮尔  我介意
Well, Danielle, in fact, I do mind.

203
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,420
我就是在乎这些囚犯的遭遇的一个
You see, I do give a shit about how prisoners are treated,

204
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,290
所以你得在庭上把你刚刚和我们说的话
which means you are gonna tell the court

205
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,240
一字不差地重复一遍
exactly what you just told us.

206
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,200
你是没听见我刚刚说的吗
Did you not hear what I just said?

207
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,370
这事最后砸回了我身上
It came back down on me like a concrete block.

208
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,290
这是我的事业  我...
This is my career. I--

209
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,890
我是不会公开作证危及我的事业的
I am not gonna go on record and jeopardize it.

210
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,900
你只能在两种里面选一个
Well, then this is gonna go one of two ways.

211
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,630
你把证据给我们
You give us your records,

212
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,990
我们默默地把它提交上去...
and we submit them quietly...

213
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,170
或者是我们依照信息自由法传唤你的证据
Or we subpoena your records under the Freedom of Information Act

214
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,560
再让你出庭作证
and put you on the stand.

215
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,700
既然你害怕危及自己的事业
And seeing as you're afraid of ruining your career,

216
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,470
我建议你选第一个
I suggest you go with option A.

217
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,450
你们两个小混蛋
You're a couple of little shits.

218
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,600
很好  你在这
Good, you're here.

219
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,270
听着  我一直想告诉你一些事
Listen, there's something I've been wanting to talk to you about.

220
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,360
哈维  你得等等再说了
Harvey, it's gonna have to wait.

221
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,330
唐娜  这事很重要
Donna, it's important.

222
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,680
弗兰克・加洛几分钟前给你留了留言
Frank Gallo left a message for you a few minutes ago.

223
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,660
-他说什么了  -他说你和迈克
- What did he say? - He said you and Mike

224
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,670
最后别想着再坑他一遍
better not be trying to screw him over again,

225
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,030
不然你们会后悔的
or you're gonna regret it.

226
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,140
哈维  他说这话是什么意思
Harvey, what's he talking about?

227
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,470
我不知道  但我现在就去弄清楚
I don't know, but I'm sure as hell gonna find out.

228
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,860
你怎么又和弗兰克・加洛搅在了一起
What the hell are you doing with Frank Gallo?

229
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,280
-哈维...  -别装傻
- Harvey-- - Don't pretend like you don't know.

230
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
他刚给我留了言
He just left me a message

231
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,480
让我确保你不会坑他
asking me to make sure that you don't fuck him over.

232
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,210
我告诉过你了
I told you,

233
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,640
我在处理布鲁克林房屋委员会的案子
I'm working on a Brooklyn Housing Authority case.

234
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,630
加洛来自布鲁克林  他认识人
Gallo is from Brooklyn. He knows people.

235
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,520
别告诉我他要你花钱买他的消息
And don't tell me he's making you pay for his information.

236
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,840
没错  而且我准备给他钱了
Yes, he is, and I'm gonna pay him.

237
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,560
迈克  他很可能屁都不知道
Mike, odds are he doesn't know jack shit

238
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,970
只是想利用你捞一笔
and he's just using you to get money.

239
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,540
不  我查过了的  好吗
No, I looked into it, all right?

240
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,570
他告诉我的信息都是真的
What he told me checks out.

241
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,610
这件事上他能帮上忙
He's on the right side of this thing.

242
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,790
你是想告诉我他忽然就变成大善人了吗
You're telling me he's all of a sudden Mother Teresa?

243
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,160
这家伙曾经想杀你
This guy tried to kill you!

244
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,500
我知道  听着  我没说他是个好人
I know that. Look, I'm not saying he's a saint.

245
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,350
我只是说我知道自己在干什么
I'm saying that I know what I'm doing.

246
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,410
你怎么就不明白呢
Don't you get it?

247
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,450
像加洛这样的人一定会复仇
A guy like Gallo finds people to get revenge on.

248
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,460
他会一直想  一直想
He thinks about it and thinks about it,

249
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,800
要想不被他报复
and the only way to survive that

250
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,370
唯有别被他想起来  让他去注意别人
is to stay out of his mind and let him find someone else.

251
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,260
也许你是对的
Maybe you're right,

252
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,750
但我已经向他保证
but I already promised him

253
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,220
用一些东西换取他的信息了
something for his information,

254
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,330
假如我现在反悔
and if I back out of that now,

255
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,310
我一定会成为他报复名单上的第一人
I'm gonna end up on the top of his list.

256
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,570
瑞秋知道这事吗
Does Rachel know about this?

257
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,780
-不知道  -那你最好祈祷
- No. - Then you better hope

258
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,170
加洛不会像给我留言这样
Gallo doesn't leave her a message

259
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,820
也去给她留言
the same way he left me one.

260
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,000
盯着窗外发呆呢  路易
Staring out the window, Louis?

261
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,930
这意味着出事了
That's a sign that something's going on.

262
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,080
没出什么事  瑞秋
Nothing's going on, Rachel.

263
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,050
那你到底为什么要逼着布莱恩・阿特曼
Then why exactly did you make Brian Altman

264
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,780
回忆那可怕的一天
relive that horrible day?

265
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,880
什么可怕的一天
Which horrible day?

266
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,300
就是你发疯  然后狠狠地
The one where you treated him like shit

267
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,720
羞辱了他的那天
because you were losing your mind.

268
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,700
那天
That day.

269
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,150
你想知道出什么事了是吧
You want to know what's going on?

270
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,990
我被告了  就是这事
I'm being sued. That's what's going on.

271
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,830
-被布莱恩吗  -不是  被斯蒂芬妮
- By Brian? - No, by Stephanie.

272
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,600
告你性骚扰  路易  这可不妙啊
For sexual harassment? Louis, this is bad.

273
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,980
我知道  瑞秋
I know what it is, Rachel.

274
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,790
那我们得谈谈你准备如何应对
Well, then we need to talk about how you're gonna handle it.

275
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,610
不  我们得谈谈你准备如何应对
No, we need to talk about how you're gonna handle it.

276
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,910
路易  这不是个好主意
Louis, that's not a good idea.

277
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,260
这是唯一的好主意
It's the only good idea.

278
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,290
你得马上过去那边  了结此事
You need to go over there right now and put an end to this.

279
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,830
-我不能这么做  -为什么
- I can't do that. - Why not?

280
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,720
因为继你之后我也和斯蒂芬妮起了冲突
Because I had a run-in with Stephanie after you did,

281
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,050
在唐娜炒了她之后又起了一次冲突
and then I had another run-in with her after Donna fired her.

282
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,490
她绝不会听我的
She's not gonna listen to me.

283
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,550
这可是性骚扰啊  瑞秋
It is sexual harassment, Rachel.

284
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,140
我的记录里不能有这种污点
I cannot have it on my record.

285
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,820
必须有人去劝服她  让她撤诉
Someone needs to convince her to let this go,

286
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,980
这人必须得是一个我信任的律师
and it needs to be a lawyer I can trust,

287
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,960
同时还必须是一个和她水平相近的人
but it also needs to be someone who's close to her level,

288
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,660
不然她就会觉得自己被攻击了
or she's gonna feel attacked.

289
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,670
那我有个绝佳人选
Then I think I have the perfect choice.

290
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,560
卡特里娜
Katrina.

291
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,350
看来路易收到我的起诉了
I take it Louis got my lawsuit.

292
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,650
没错  我来问你怎么现在提起诉讼
He did, and I'm here to ask why you're bringing it now.

293
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,930
因为你对他的言论指控...
Because the things you're alleging he said--

294
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,250
对他的言论指控
Alleging he said?

295
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,670
看来你不是以朋友  而是律师身份来的
I guess it's lawyer first, friend second.

296
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,940
不是这样  正因为我们是朋友我才来
That's not fair. I'm only here because we're friends.

297
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,470
也因为你想让我忘了皮尔逊-斯佩克特-
And because you wanted to convince me to forget

298
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,360
利特律所毁了我的事业
that Pearson Specter Litt ruined my career.

299
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,520
斯特芬尼  我知道你被解雇了
Stephanie, I know you got fired,

300
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,610
但是这场诉讼会毁了路易
but this lawsuit could destroy Louis.

301
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,530
我整理一下
Let me get this straight.

302
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,930
那个曾让我为了个对我刻薄
The woman who convinced me to leave a good job

303
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,820
性骚扰  并将我解雇的公司
for one where I was treated terribly,

304
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,480
而放弃了份好工作的女人
sexually harassed, and then fired

305
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,660
现在想找我帮忙
is now asking me for a personal favor?

306
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,840
是的  没错
Yes, I am.

307
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,730
我现在没心情帮别人忙
Well, I'm not in the mood to grant one.

308
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,940
所以你可以告诉路易我们法庭上见
So you can tell Louis I will see him in court.

309
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,030
斯特芬尼  我在兰德-考德-赞恩律所
Stephanie, the woman I knew

310
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,410
认识的那个女人可不是这样的
at Rand Kaldor Zane wouldn't do this.

311
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,310
拜托...
Please...

312
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,130
告诉我实情我才能帮你
tell me what's going on so I can help.

313
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,040
我在这儿听到些闲话
I heard people here talking,

314
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,510
他们说我被解雇是因为我工作不利
and they said that I got fired because I couldn't hack it.

315
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,520
这不是真的
Well, that's not true,

316
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,110
我也不能让他们有这种想法
and I won't have them thinking it is.

317
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,600
那就关上门来坐好
Then close that door and sit down,

318
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,580
因为我保证我们
because I'm betting that we can work out a deal

319
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,270
能想出对策
right now that shows anyone

320
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,430
让那些小看你的人知道你有多厉害
who's ever underestimated you just how strong you are.

321
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,880
亚历克斯  你见唐娜了吗
Alex, have you seen Donna by any chance?

322
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,020
-什么  -唐娜  你见她了吗
- What? - Donna. Have you seen her?

323
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,120
-我有话跟她说  -没见过  哈维
- I need to tell her something. - I don't know, Harvey.

324
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,700
我没时间关注你前秘书的
I don't have time to track your former secretary's

325
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,820
一举一动
every damn move.

326
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,970
你怎么回事
What the hell's wrong with you?

327
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,350
我告诉你我怎么回事
I'll tell you what's wrong with me.

328
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,800
马斯特森建筑公司对这件监狱案件很恼火
Masterson Construction's pissed about this prison case.

329
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,140
还没消火  你都按他们的要求做了啊
Still? You handed it off like they asked.

330
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,500
不  他们想让案子了结  不是被移交
No, they wanted the thing gone, not handed off,

331
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,050
现在这已经变成集体诉讼案了
and now it's turned into a class action,

332
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,200
明天就要开庭了
and it's going to trial tomorrow.

333
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,240
听我说  你的工作并不是了结此案
Listen to me, it's not your job to make this thing go away.

334
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,180
哈维  我是他们的律师  他们有麻烦
Harvey, I'm their attorney. They had a problem,

335
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,810
他们想把它解决掉  而我没做好
they wanted it fixed, and I didn't fix it.

336
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,770
胡扯  你让皮尔逊-斯佩克特把它当
Bullshit, you got Pearson Specter to drop it

337
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,450
烫手山芋一样扔了  你也只能做到这步了
like a hot potato. That's all you could've done.

338
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,990
不  我本该把整个案子都处理掉
No, what I could have done was kill the whole damn thing.

339
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,350
因为我没做好  他们在其它监狱找了个犯人
And since I didn't, they found some inmate at another prison

340
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,910
把这个案子闹大了
to break the case wide open,

341
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,870
我也为此吃了许多苦头
which is why I just had to eat a ton of shit.

342
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,990
你刚刚说什么
What did you just say? 

343
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,860
我说他们在其它监狱找到个证人
I said they found a witness at another prison, 

344
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,870
而我现在快把客户丢了
and now I'm gonna lost my goddamn client.

345
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,260
你要去哪儿
Where you going?

346
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,800
我说了  我找唐娜有事
Like I said, I need to find Donna.

347
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,830
立刻回答我  你知道迈克在哪儿吗
I want to know right now, do you know where Mike is?

348
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,730
-不  我不知道  -你不知道他在哪儿
- No, I don't. - You don't know where,

349
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,090
还是不知道他在办哪个案子
or you don't know what case he's working on?

350
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,610
我都不知道  但如果你冷静点
I don't know either one, but if you calm down,

351
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,250
或许我能帮你找到他
then maybe I can help you find him.

352
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,460
不  瑞秋  我不想让你帮我找他
No, Rachel, I don't want help finding him

353
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,410
事实上  我不想让你告诉他
In fact, I don't want you telling him

354
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,910
我有找过他
I was looking for him at all.

355
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,040
-奥斯卡・雷耶斯  -什么事
- Oscar Reyes? - Yes.

356
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,650
我是哈维・斯佩克特  我注意到
My name is Harvey Specter. It's come to my attention

357
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,690
你正在提起一桩集体诉讼案
that you're filing a class-action lawsuit.

358
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,600
没错  你有什么事
We are. How can I help you?

359
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,090
无偿法律服务对我们律所意义重大
Our pro bono work means a lot to us.

360
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,610
我们对待案子也非常认真
We take it very seriously,

361
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,140
我现在有个难以启齿的问题想问你
and I have a very difficult question to ask you.

362
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,600
-什么  -我想知道
- What is it? - I need to know

363
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,660
你对本案的处理方式是否满意
if you're happy with the way your case is being handled,

364
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,130
因为如果迈克・罗斯没有尽心尽力的...
because if Mike Ross isn't doing everything he can

365
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,550
-帮你  -打住
- to help you-- - Stop right there.

366
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,300
罗斯先生可是全心投入
Mr. Ross has dedicated himself

367
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,040
为我儿子讨回公道
to finding justice for my son.

368
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,560
不仅如此  当我提出和解时
And not only that, when I was offered a settlement,

369
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,290
他说服我不要和解而是寻求真相
he convinced me to turn it down and find out the real truth,

370
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,630
所以你告诉管事的  本案别让其他人插手
so you tell whoever's in charge that I don't want anyone else

371
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,210
我只相信迈克和奥利佛
working on this case other than Mike and Oliver.

372
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,660
谢谢
Thank you.

373
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,260
你向我保证过
You gave me your word 

374
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,380
你不会插手那个监狱案
you'd stay the hell out of that prison case.

375
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,530
-哈维  我...  -你要站在我面前
- Harvey, I-- - You're gonna stand there

376
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,140
跟我说你没插手此案吗
and tell me you're not working on it?

377
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,590
因为奥斯卡・雷耶斯告诉我你为他做的事
Because Oscar Reyes told me you deserve a medal

378
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,710
都该拿块奖牌了
for what you're doing for him.

379
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,160
哈维  我确实是想让法律诊所接手的
Harvey, I meant to let the clinic handle it, okay?

380
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,630
后来发现这案子比我们想的要严重
It just turned out that this thing was bigger than we thought. 

381
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,520
它就是变成
I don't give a shit

382
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,220
一场世纪审判我都不在乎
if it turned into the trial of the century.

383
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,140
我们有言在前
We had an agreement.

384
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,050
不  是你和亚历克斯的协议
No, you had an agreement with Alex,

385
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,760
我同意在文件上签字
and then I agreed to sign a document,

386
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
但事实证明  反腐对我来说
but as it turns out, stopping corruption

387
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,170
要比客户底线重要的多
is more important to me than some client's bottom line.

388
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,330
清醒清醒吧  现在就停下来
Then grow the hell up, because that ends now.

389
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,400
哈维  我得坚持到底
Harvey, I have to see this through.

390
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,970
坚持到底  你疯了吗
See this through? Are you out of your mind?

391
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,970
你以为我不知道加洛在帮你办这个案子吗
You think I don't know this is what Gallo was helping you with?

392
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,280
我告诉过你  加洛不成问题
I told you, Gallo is not gonna be a problem.

393
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,140
我跟你说过像加洛这种人总会成为麻烦
And I told you guys like Gallo are always a problem.

394
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,680
好吧  我跟你说过
Yeah, and what about what I told you happens

395
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,650
如果我对他违背誓言会发生什么
if I go back on my word with him now?

396
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,090
或者像你说的他给瑞秋打电话又会怎样
Or what you said about what happens if he calls Rachel.

397
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,060
你说你付钱他就帮你
Were you lying when you said you'd pay him

398
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,140
-是骗我的吗  -不  不是
- if he came through for you? - No, I wasn't.

399
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,310
现在打钱给他
Then pay him right now.

400
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,290
我替你付  但你不能再插手此案
You can take it out of my pocket, but you're done.

401
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,280
-哈维  不是...  -不  是你听我说
- Harvey, it's not-- - No, listen to me 

402
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,430
因为我不希望你对我的话还有不清楚
because I don't want there to be any misunderstanding.

403
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,500
除了告诉奥利佛这案子归他管以外
You spend one more minute on this case,

404
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,470
不要在这案子上再花一分钟时间
other than telling Oliver it's his,

405
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,070
-就这么定了  -你什么意思
- I'm shutting you down. - What the hell does that mean?

406
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,030
意思是说明天我要出席听证会
It means I'm going to the hearing tomorrow

407
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,250
当场告发你违背协议
and telling them that you broke your agreement.

408
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,660
不管负责聆讯的法官是谁
And I don't care who the judge is,

409
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,390
那家律所都一定会被踢出这起案子
they'll toss the clinic off the case,

410
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,210
而你的朋友奥斯卡也一个子儿都拿不到
and your friend Oscar won't get a dime.

411
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,350
路易  别搅了  我有消息告诉你
Louis, stop blending! I have news.

412
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,650
卡特里娜  谢天谢地你终于回来了
Katrina, thank God you're back.

413
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,940
来  喝一杯李子泥
Here, have a prunie.

414
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,080
你到底弄了多少李子泥
Exactly how many prunies did you make?

415
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,420
不知道  我是借此发泄压力
I don't know. I'm stress blending.

416
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,530
如果待会儿你说的不是好消息
If I don't hear some good news soon,

417
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,160
世界将会出现李子短缺危机
there's gonna be an international prune shortage.

418
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,060
所以请一定要告诉我
So please tell me that you talked Stephanie

419
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,200
你成功说服斯蒂芬妮撤诉
out of this bullshit.

420
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,320
路易  我没能说服她
Louis, I couldn't talk her out of it,

421
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,250
但我说服她接受了这个交易
but I did manage to talk her into this.

422
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,660
好吧  这种程度我还能接受
Okay, well, I can live with this amount.

423
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,420
但这里写着我承认对她进行过性骚扰
But this says that I admit to sexually harassing her.

424
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,900
-事实如此  -一派胡言  
- You did sexually harass her. - Oh, that's a load of crap.

425
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,950
我从没有调戏过斯蒂芬妮・帕特尔
I never hit on Stephanie Patel.

426
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,440
据法律定义性骚扰不单指调戏  你知道的
And that's not the definition of harassment, and you know it.

427
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,310
我不管  我不接受
Well, I don't care. I can't accept it.

428
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,120
为什么
Why not? 

429
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,990
因为我以前也被控告过性骚扰
Because I've been sued for sexual harassment before, 

430
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,690
我不能把自己弄得像个惯犯
and I can't have it look like a pattern.

431
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,200
我并不知情
I didn't know.

432
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,200
那是你来这里之前的事了  那起诉讼
It was before your time, and it was a bullshit suit

433
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,930
纯粹是丹尼尔・哈德曼一手捏造的
concocted by Daniel Hardman.

434
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,530
我不能被打上惯犯的烙印
I can't have a reputation for this.

435
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,160
我明白  路易  但斯蒂芬妮担心
I understand that, Louis, but Stephanie is worried

436
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,110
给别人留下办事不力的印象
people think she can't hack it as a lawyer,

437
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,570
而逼迫你承认过错则是她认为
and making you admit to what you did

438
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,030
可以扭转旁人看法的唯一方式
is the only way she sees to make them think otherwise.

439
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,660
抱歉  我不能签字
- I'm sorry. I can't sign it.

440
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,600
路易  我知道这不是你想要的结果
Louis, I know this isn't what you wanted,

441
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,530
但就我的专业意见
but in my professional opinion,

442
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,420
这是你最好的选择
this is the best you're going to do.

443
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,450
至少用一天时间  好好考虑
At least take a day to think about it.

444
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,050
路易  自不待言
And, Louis, this goes without saying,

445
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,390
无论你多想见斯蒂芬妮  都不要去
but however tempted you are, don't go see Stephanie.

446
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:01,990
你好
Hey.

447
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,380
我不好
Don't "Hey" me.

448
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,980
看来你听说我和哈维之间的事了
I take it you heard about what happened between me and Harvey.

449
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,670
看来你是没听说
I take it you didn't hear

450
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,770
我和哈维之间发生的事
about what happened between me and Harvey.

451
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,570
瑞秋  他跟你说什么了
Rachel, what did he tell you?

452
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,700
他没跟我说什么
He didn't tell me anything.

453
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,410
只是问我你在哪里以及你在忙什么
He asked me where you were and what you were working on,

454
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,280
我不得不当面对他撒谎
and I had to lie to his face.

455
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,700
-瑞秋  我...  -你听见我说的话了吗
- Rachel, I-- - Did you hear me?

456
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,250
我不得不当面对他撒谎
I had to lie to Harvey's face.

457
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,910
是的  我听见了  对不起
Yes, I heard you, and I'm sorry.

458
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,250
我不想听对不起
I don't want to hear "I'm sorry."

459
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,270
你想听的是你会就此罢手
I want to hear that you're dropping this goddamn thing.

460
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,810
-瑞秋  我...  -不要找借口
- Rachel, I-- - No excuses.

461
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,300
你说过这是你对奥斯卡・雷耶斯的承诺
You said it's your word to Oscar Reyes

462
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,000
这对你很重要
that mattered to you.

463
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,680
你知道吗  迈克
Well, you know what, Mike?

464
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,580
你需要把你做事的优先次序搞清楚
You need to get your priorities straight,

465
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,300
是因为你  现在我也没有了信誉
because my word became nothing today,

466
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,600
而且我不想再因为你陷入这种境地
and I don't ever want to be put in that position again.

467
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,040
决定权在你  你要么去法律诊所工作
So it's up to you. You either go and work at the clinic

468
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,590
要么继续留在皮尔逊・斯佩克特
or you stay at Pearson Specter,

469
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,100
但你不能再像现在这样把两边都当傻瓜
but what you can't do anymore is play them both for fools

470
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,670
还让我来当你的挡箭牌
and put me in the middle.

471
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,300
我要走了  等我回来
I'm gonna go now, and when I come back,

472
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,960
告诉我你的决定
you can let me know what you've decided.

473
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,710
这么巧
Oh, hey, you.

474
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,300
宝拉  你怎么来了
Paula, what are you doing here?

475
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,480
我刚好在附近
I was in the neighborhood,

476
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,280
想着也许我们能共进晚餐
and I was thinking maybe we could get dinner.

477
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,950
对不起
Listen, I'm sorry,

478
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,950
我今晚没心情
but I am just not in the mood tonight.

479
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,100
抱歉
I'm sorry.

480
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,290
这和你对唐娜说起
Does this have something to do with 

481
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,400
我们的事情有关吗
how it went when you told Donna about us?

482
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,050
什么  不是
What? No.

483
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,640
我都还没找到机会告诉她
I didn't even get a chance to tell her.

484
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,880
没有找到机会是什么意思
Well, what does that mean, you didn't get the chance?

485
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,760
我本来打算说  但临时出了点事
It means I went to tell her, but something came up.

486
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,210
什么事
What exactly came up?

487
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,590
是什么事情重要吗
What does it matter what came up?

488
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,480
我只是好奇到底是什么事能重要到
Well, I'm just wondering what was so important

489
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,090
让你一整天都抽不出一点时间去告诉她
that you couldn't find the time to tell her the entire day.

490
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,440
好吧  如果你真的想知道
Well, if you really need to know,

491
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,310
一个杀人犯正和迈克合作办案
a murderer turns out to be working with Mike

492
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,130
而这案子是他向我发过誓不会再碰的
on a case he swore to me he wouldn't be working on.

493
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,620
我一整天都在想办法解决这个问题
I spent the entire day trying to fix it.

494
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,720
我觉得比起告诉唐娜
And I thought it was more important

495
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,850
我的感情生活  这事更重要
than telling Donna about my love life.

496
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,220
抱歉  我就不该问
I'm sorry I asked.

497
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,240
我没想反应这么大
Look, I didn't mean to overreact.

498
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,240
只是今天我过得太糟了
I've just had a hell of a day,

499
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,530
我保证明天就跟她说
and I'll tell her tomorrow, I promise.

500
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,050
哈维  你无需保证我任何事
Harvey, you don't need to promise me anything.

501
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,420
其实如果你不介意
In fact, I'd like to stay out of it entirely,

502
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,370
我宁愿抽身事外
if you don't mind.

503
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,690
-宝拉...  -真的没关系
- Paula-- - No, it's fine.

504
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,490
因为  这事本来都不是我提起的
Because, you know, I'm not the one that brought it up.

505
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,060
老实说  我不喜欢看到你表现得
And, frankly, I don't like you behaving as though

506
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,860
似乎是我逼你这么做的
I'm the one making you do this.

507
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,220
你到底怎么了
What's going on here?

508
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,870
因为你更倾向于
What's going on here is you're rather keen

509
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,220
把我们的恋情向唐娜保密
on keeping our relationship a secret from Donna...

510
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,670
而你却能毫无顾忌地向路易坦白
when you clearly had no trouble telling Louis.

511
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,890
你是在担心我对唐娜有感觉吗
Are you worried that I have feelings for her?

512
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,880
你当然对她有感觉
Of course you have feelings for her.

513
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,110
在她离开你以后你就开始恐慌发作了
You started having panic attacks after she left you.

514
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,070
要不是因为你的恐慌发作
We wouldn't even know each other

515
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,410
我们甚至都不会相识
if it weren't for those feelings.

516
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,310
-你到底想说什么  -我不知道
- Then what are you saying? - I don't know.

517
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,470
也许你并不想告诉她
Maybe you don't want to tell her 

518
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,410
是因为你喜欢当她的焦点和倾慕对象
because you like being the object of her attention and affection,

519
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,870
你担心坦白之后就会改变现状
and you're worried this will change that.

520
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,500
她的焦点和倾慕对象
Her attention and affection?

521
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,050
你非要我说出来吗  哈维
Would you like me to say it, Harvey?

522
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,740
她爱你
She loves you.

523
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,870
至少她内心某处爱着你
At least part of her does,

524
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,650
也许你内心某处也喜欢且不想失去这种感觉
and maybe part of you likes it and doesn't want it to stop.

525
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,240
如果你有勇气告诉唐娜
And we wouldn't even be discussing this

526
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,080
让她朝前看
if you had the courage to tell Donna the truth

527
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,240
我们就不用讨论这个了
and let her move on. 

528
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,220
对于一个
You know, for someone 

529
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,520
不想再掺和这件事的人来说
who didn't want to be involved in this anymore,

530
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,440
你可真是话很多
you sure have a hell of a lot to say.

531
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,780
那我再说一件事
Then I'll say one more thing.

532
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,160
如果我说的不对  那你早上
If what I'm saying is wrong, then you won't have any trouble

533
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,720
把我们俩的事告诉唐娜就不会那么困难
telling Donna in the morning.

534
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,410
迈克  你去哪了
Mike, where the hell have you been?

535
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,830
撤案动议就在明天
The motion to dismiss is tomorrow.

536
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,770
我得整个过一遍
I need to go over everything--

537
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,350
奥利佛  我不能再帮你了
Oliver, I can't help you anymore.

538
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,550
什么
What?

539
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,550
我说我不能再跟这个案子了
I said I can't work the case anymore.

540
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,860
为什么不能
Why the hell not?

541
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,130
因为哈维知道了
'Cause Harvey found out.

542
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,140
该死  你...
Shit, are you--

543
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,980
他不会告发我们  但是他的态度很明确
He's not gonna hand us in, but he did make it clear

544
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,000
如果我再在这个案子上花一秒
that if I spent another second on this case

545
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,900
他就会毁掉整件事
that he'll pull the plug on the whole damn thing.

546
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,320
真是难以置信  在我们上庭的前一晚
I don't believe this. I mean, you come here

547
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,720
你把这颗炸弹扔到我面前
and you drop this bomb on me the night before we go to court.

548
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,870
奥利佛  不是炸弹  你一直都知道的
Oliver, it's not a bomb. You knew all along

549
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,140
你得独立完成
you were gonna have to do this on your own.

550
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,540
我知道你不会在我身边
I knew you wouldn't be up there next to me,

551
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,570
但我还指望这你帮我做准备
but I was counting on you helping me to prepare.

552
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,950
-奥利佛  -该死  迈克
- Oliver-- - Son of a bitch, Mike!

553
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,490
你知道我身上发生过什么
You know what happens to me!

554
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,510
上次就发生了  明天也会发生的
It happened last time, and now it's gonna happen tomorrow

555
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,030
因为你把我晾一边了
because you're goddamn hanging me out to dry!

556
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,150
你知道吗  奥利佛  我受够了
You know what, Oliver? I have had it up to here

557
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,860
你每做一个选择都要怪我
with you blaming me for every choice that you make.

558
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,140
当你同意接下这个案子的时候
You knew there would come a time when you'd be up there

559
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,360
你就知道总有一天你得独自站在那
by yourself when you agreed to take this case.

560
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,340
上次我们面临这样的情况的时候
Now, last time we were in this situation,

561
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,120
我照顾了你一夜  你还是搞砸了
I coddled you all night, and you still dropped the goddamn ball.

562
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,400
所以这次我们的准备方式就是我告诉你
So, this time, we're gonna prepare by me telling you

563
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,050
不要在像个小孩子一样了
to stop acting like a little boy,

564
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,630
要开始像个男人一样  把事情搞定
start acting like a man, and get the goddamn job done!

565
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,000
因为如果你做不到的话  奥斯卡还有那些囚犯
Because if you don't, Oscar and those prisoners,

566
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,470
他们就什么都没有了
they're gonna be left with nothing.

567
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,400
谢谢
Thank you.

568
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,080
斯特芬妮
Stephanie.

569
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,960
斯特芬妮
Stephanie.

570
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,330
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

571
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,770
我一直在想你的条件
I've been thinking about your offer,

572
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,650
我希望我们能谈谈
and I was hoping we could talk.

573
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,050
我们不能  因为我们是原告和被告
Well, we can't because we're on opposite sides of a lawsuit.

574
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,800
我知道
I know that,

575
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,860
你想让我签什么协议我都愿意签
and I'm willing to sign whatever you want.

576
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,220
你想让我赔多少钱我都愿意赔
I'm willing to pay whatever you want.

577
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,420
我只是不能承认我...
I just can't admit that I--

578
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,240
做过的事
Did exactly what you did.

579
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,490
太糟了
Too bad.

580
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,220
因为你不愿意承认
Because if you won't admit it,

581
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,720
我会让陪审团来帮你承认
I'll make a jury admit it for you.

582
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,630
斯特芬妮  我是想来讲道理的
Stephanie, I'm trying to be reasonable here.

583
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,880
也许在你将自己置于
Well, maybe you should have thought of that

584
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,320
被低级的律师打败的境地之前
before putting yourself in a position

585
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,760
你就应该想到了
to let a lowly associate wipe the floor with you.

586
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,760
打败...  我的名声
Wipe the--My reputation is that of a pillar

587
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,030
在法律界是数一数二的
of the legal community,

588
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,480
所以你不要做梦能打败我了
so you're not wiping the floor with shit.

589
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,200
你的名声就是你是个混蛋
Your reputation is that you're a son of a bitch,

590
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,710
而我会向全世界证明这一点
and I'm gonna prove it to the world.

591
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,700
不  斯特芬妮  你唯一能证明的
No, Stephanie, the only thing you're gonna prove is that

592
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,150
就是你正如别人认为的一样  是个可悲的失败者
you're the pathetic loser that everyone thinks you are,

593
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,150
因为你挑起了一场
because you just picked a fight

594
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,060
对手远超你的水平的战争
with someone who is way out of your league!

595
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,530
你活在什么样的幻想世界里啊
What delusional reality are you living in?

596
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,590
一个我会在庭审上说得清清楚楚
The one where I make it crystal clear at trial

597
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,900
你因为被解雇
that you were fired for cause

598
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,970
而策划了这场诉讼来泄愤
and concocted this lawsuit out of spite.

599
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,870
我没有虚构满满一屋子
I didn't concoct a room full of witnesses

600
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,340
看到和听到真正的路易・利特的证人
who saw and heard the real Louis Litt.

601
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,880
所以在我看来  你将欠我很多很多钱
So the way I see it, you're gonna owe me so much money,

602
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,440
多到我再也不用去工作了
I'm never gonna need another job again.

603
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,920
哈维  你在这干什么
Harvey, what are you doing here?

604
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,370
执行合伙人不能偶尔
Can't a managing partner have a drink

605
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,590
和他最喜欢的首席运营官喝一杯吗
with his favorite COO every once in a while?

606
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,350
能  但是我有一大堆的工作要做
He can, but I got a ton of work to do,

607
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,780
我还想在午夜之前回家
and I'd like to get home before midnight.

608
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,440
我有事要告诉你
There's something I need to tell you.

609
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,880
哈维  怎么了
Harvey, what's going on?

610
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,780
我一直在见宝拉・阿加德
I've been seeing Paula Agard.

611
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,270
不再是见心理医生那种
And not as my therapist anymore.

612
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,720
我们在交往
We've been seeing each other.

613
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,590
-怎么  -什么怎么
- What? - What do you mean what?

614
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,380
我只是觉得你以为我不知道很好笑
I'm just amused that you think I didn't know.

615
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,040
-唐娜  -在你当上执行合伙人那天
- Donna. - The day you made managing partner,

616
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,500
你自己开车来上班  不是开的红色的车
you drove yourself to work, not in the red car,

617
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,650
而是开的黑色法拉利代托纳
but in the black Ferrari Daytona.

618
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,130
最重要的是  你告诉我和路易
And on top of that, you told me and Louis

619
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,960
那天晚上你有事要处理
that you had things to take care of that night,

620
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,360
但我知道你的日程
but I know your schedule,

621
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,640
我知道你自己直接从公司
and I know what happened was you drove yourself

622
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,440
开车回家  换上了你觉得
straight home from the office, you changed into whatever outfit

623
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,480
最能打动她的衣服
you thought would impress her the most,

624
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,290
然后直奔她家
and then you went right over to her house,

625
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,680
把她迷得神魂颠倒
and you swept her off her feet.

626
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,740
但是你那天晚上还问我怎么了
But you just asked me the other night if something was going on 

627
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,970
因为我的举止不同以往
because I've been acting different.

628
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,520
那是因为我努力让你敞开心扉
'Cause I was trying to get you to open up,

629
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,100
但是你没有理解到
but you missed the signal,

630
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,580
所以我想我就等着好了  你这不就来了
so I figured I'd just keep on waiting, and here you are,

631
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,040
时间差不多
more or less right on time.

632
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,270
-差不多  -我给你的期限是明天
- More or less? - Well, I was giving you until tomorrow, 

633
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,940
所以实际上你提前完成了
so you're actually ahead of schedule.

634
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,360
那是宝拉的贡献
Well, that was Paula's doing.

635
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,460
-我很为你高兴  哈维  我想听你从头说起
- I'm happy for you, Harvey, and I want to hear all about it,

636
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,280
但是如我所说  我有一大堆事要做
but like I said, I've got a ton of work to do,

637
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,300
我还想在午夜前回家  所以...
and I want to get home before midnight, so...

638
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,550
继续  工作吧  以后聊
Go on, finish. We'll talk later.

639
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,980
我很开心你终于告诉我了
I'm glad you finally told me.

640
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,780
谢谢  唐娜  我也是
Thanks, Donna. Me too.

641
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,100
唐娜  你还好吗
Donna, are you okay?

642
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,790
你看起来就和见鬼了一样
You look like you just saw a ghost.

643
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,890
我不知道  我...
I don't know. I...

644
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,080
我刚收到了一些我早该料到
I just got some news I should have seen coming, 

645
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,170
却没能料到的消息
and I didn't.

646
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,960
你想谈谈吗
Do you want to talk about it?

647
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,460
不  不用  我没事的
No, I don't. I'll--I'll be fine.

648
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,140
我刚也收到了消息
Well, I just got some news

649
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,230
是我们应该但没能料到的
that we should have seen coming but didn't,

650
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,590
而且还不是好消息
and it's not good.

651
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,900
是什么
What is it?

652
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,340
我们收到了传票要去指证路易
We've just been subpoenaed to testify against Louis.

653
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,210
那是什么
What's that?

654
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,380
木须肉和炒饭
Moo shu pork and fried rice.

655
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,100
我之前那么跟你说话
The way I treated you before,

656
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,900
所以不确定你吃了没
I wasn't sure if you'd eaten yet.

657
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,880
-哈维  -然后我觉得我们可以边吃
- Harvey-- - And I was thinking that maybe we could eat

658
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,940
边告诉你  我很抱歉
while I tell you that I'm sorry

659
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,620
以及  我跟唐娜说了
and that I told Donna.

660
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,820
-你跟她说了  -是的  你是对的
- You told her? - Yes. You were right.

661
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,450
我得告诉她  不然这对她不公平
I needed to tell her, and it was unfair to her,

662
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,940
对你也不公平
and it was unfair to you.

663
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,750
-我可没那么说过  -没有  但你有这个意思
- I never said that. - No, but you meant it.

664
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,480
哈维  你一个不小心
Harvey, if you're not careful,

665
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,230
就要变成一个成熟且优秀的男友了
you're gonna become a full-fledged outstanding boyfriend.

666
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,530
男友
Boyfriend?

667
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,520
男友
Boyfriend.

668
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,840
那我就尽量不小心一点
Then I'll try not to be careful.

669
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,590
进来吧
Come in.

670
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,770
对了  她听过之后有什么反应吗
By the way, how did she take it?

671
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,160
她没事的
She was fine.

672
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,790
-你确定吗  -确定
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

673
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,850
她好像早就知道了
Turned out she already knew.

674
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,160
我很高兴你告诉她了
Well, I'm glad you told her.

675
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,730
我还希望你买的东西里有蛋卷
And I hope you got some egg rolls in there.

676
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,720
卡特里娜
Katrina, hey.

677
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,410
路易  你干了什么
Louis, what the hell did you do?

678
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,570
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

679
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,970
那为什么昨晚唐娜和瑞秋
Then why were Donna and Rachel

680
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,640
甩给我一张传票
slapped with subpoenas last night?

681
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,950
卡特里娜  听我说
Katrina, listen to me--

682
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,400
该死的  路易
God damn it, Louis!

683
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,220
在我明确告诉过你不要那么做之后
How long did you wait to go over there

684
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,530
你忍了多久就忍不住了
after I explicitly told you not to?

685
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,330
而且  这已经不重要了
Well, you know what? It doesn't matter,

686
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,360
因为你现在的工作是要击垮那个女人
because now your job is to blow that woman out of the water.

687
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,580
那是相当有难度的
Well, that's gonna be pretty hard,

688
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,430
因为她有一帮证人
since she has a room full of witnesses

689
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,160
还有唐娜的录音  说你做错了
and she also has Donna on record saying what you did was wrong

690
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,400
以及这就是为什么你失去了对助理律师的领导
and that's why you lost dominion over the associates.

691
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,540
唐娜干了什么
Whoa, Donna did what?

692
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,330
她也不知道你会被起诉  路易
She didn't know you were going to get sued, Louis.

693
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,830
斯特芬妮让她出庭作证  我们就完了
And when Stephanie gets her up on the stand, we're dead.

694
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,470
那她就只能出庭做伪证了
Well, then she's just gonna have to lie on the stand.

695
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,390
路易  这根本就是疯了  你也知道
- Louis, that is insane, and you know it.

696
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,590
该死的  我们总要想个方法啊
Well, God damn it, we have to figure some way to get out of this, 

697
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,400
因为我今年已经失去了一切
because I have lost everything this year

698
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,610
我不能再失去这个了
and I can't lose this.

699
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,040
那不如你去向她道歉吧
How about you tell her you're sorry?

700
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,850
你说什么
What the hell did you just say?

701
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,990
我说去向她道歉
I said tell her that you're sorry.

702
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,240
你来这儿干嘛  你是在替她监视我们吗
What are you even doing here? Are you spying on us for her?

703
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,480
没有  我是来告诉你我收到传票了
No, um, I came to tell you I'd been served with a subpoena.

704
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,920
好的  布莱恩  我不用你帮忙
Well, Brian, I don't need your help,

705
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,200
因为道歉就意味着要认罪
because you can't apologize without admitting guilt,

706
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,410
而这是我最不想做的事
which is the whole thing that I don't want to do.

707
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,000
路易  我不知道你有没有注意到
Louis, I don't know if you've noticed,

708
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,050
但不管怎么样这是少不了的
but that's pretty much going to happen anyway.

709
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,860
请允许我...
If I may...

710
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,780
这是认罪  但也是冒险试一把
it is admitting guilt, and it is taking a chance,

711
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,040
但如果是我因为你对我说的那些伤人的话
but if I were thinking of suing you

712
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,660
而起诉的你
for the horrible things you said to me...

713
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,900
那么这才是我想听到的
that's what I'd want to hear.

714
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,660
你在这儿干什么
What are you doing here?

715
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,770
我以为你不会再和这件事
I thought you weren't supposed to have

716
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,810
有任何瓜葛了
anything to do with this anymore.

717
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,280
是没有  但协议里也没说
I'm not, but there's nothing in that agreement

718
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,000
我不能来看我的朋友奥利弗
that says I can't come watch my friend Oliver

719
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,540
在庭上大展身手啊
kick some ass in court.

720
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,040
那赶快系好安全带
Well, strap the hell in.

721
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,590
因为这位帅哥要大展身手了
'Cause this motherfu--er is going down.

722
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,080
我可以进来吗
May I come in?

723
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,640
你这次又想要什么
What do you want this time?

724
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,860
告诉我我一文不值连办公室都不配有吗
Tell me I'm so worthless I don't even deserve an office?

725
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,470
我想来跟你道歉
I want to tell you I'm sorry,

726
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,030
要说一文不值的人  那也是我
and if anyone's worthless, it's me.

727
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,540
路易  如果你觉得假装给我道个歉
Louis, if you think pretending to give me an apology

728
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,750
就能让我撤诉的话
is gonna make me drop this suit, 

729
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,910
你还会有别的麻烦的
you have another thing coming.

730
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,090
我不是这样想的
I don't think that.

731
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,150
我只是觉得自己欠你一个解释
I just think that I owe you an explanation.

732
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,790
你看...
You see...

733
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,410
在我对你说出那些话的
the night before

734
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,570
前一晚
I said those horrible things to you,

735
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,700
我的未婚妻离开了我
my fiancée left me.

736
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,960
她怀孕了
She was pregnant.

737
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,050
哪怕孩子不是我的
And even though the child wasn't mine...

738
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,010
我终于要当爸爸了
I was finally gonna be a dad.

739
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,770
而当一切消失的时候
And when all that went away,

740
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,650
我的整个人生都乱了
my entire life turned upside down.

741
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,250
我心烦意乱
I mean, I was reeling.

742
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,190
所以当时布莱恩来向我请假
So, when Brian had asked me for time off

743
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,320
说要去陪他老婆生孩子
to go have a baby

744
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,900
而你又替他说话
and you defended him...

745
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,850
你就把所有的火都发到了我身上
You took everything you were feeling out on me.

746
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,050
是的  我为此感到羞愧
Yeah, and I am ashamed of that.

747
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,460
斯特芬尼
Stephanie...

748
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,020
你想让我签什么文件都可以
I will sign anything you want.

749
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,390
只要能让大家都知道你不是个弱者
I will say anything you need to make sure

750
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,030
让我说什么都可以
that the world knows that you are not a pushover,

751
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,090
哪怕是认罪
even if that includes admitting guilt.

752
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:55,280
如果因为某种原因他们这里还是不要你
And if for some reason they still can't accept you here,

753
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,020
你就回来和我们一起  这是持续邀约
you have your job back with us, standing offer.

754
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,630
我很感谢你能对我敞开心扉  路易
I appreciate you opening up to me, Louis.

755
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,510
但这不是说大家觉得我是个弱者
But this wasn't really about people thinking I'm a pushover.

756
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,380
而是当你对我说出那些话时
It was about how you made me feel

757
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,940
你给我的感觉
when you said those things to me.

758
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,200
它们为什么会让你有感觉呢
Why would they make you feel anything?

759
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,040
那些话明显不是真的啊
I mean, they were so clearly untrue.

760
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,230
-是吗  -拜托
- Were they? - Come on.

761
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,340
你胡说什么呢  斯特芬妮
What are you talking about? Stephanie...

762
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,730
我34岁了  一周工作90小时
I'm 34 years old. I work 90 hours a week.

763
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,790
我没有任何亲人
I don't have anyone.

764
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,250
我没有时间约会
I don't have time to meet anyone,

765
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,000
我确实担心我永远也
and I'm worried that I never will,

766
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,860
永远也无法拥有一个家
that I--that I'll never have a family.

767
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,660
所以当你说没有人愿意和我要孩子时
So, when you said no one would want to have children with me...

768
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,110
我真的很抱歉  斯特芬妮
I am so sorry, Stephanie.

769
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,750
谢谢  路易
Thank you, Louis.

770
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,400
我真的很想过去抱你一下
I feel like I want to come over there and give you a hug,

771
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,930
但是恐怕不太合适
but it's probably inappropriate

772
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,820
因为你正在因为性骚扰起诉我
since you're suing me for sexual harassment.

773
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,290
我不打算告你了  路易
I'm not suing you anymore, Louis.

774
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,550
法官大人  本案完全是基于
Your Honor, this suit hinges on the testimony

775
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,000
一个罪犯的证词
of a convicted felon,

776
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,380
更别提整体原告都是
not to mention the entire class is made up of felons

777
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,430
找机会报复监狱的罪犯
looking for a chance to stick it to the prisons

778
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,730
只是监狱完成了监禁他们的使命
that did their duty by incarcerating them.

779
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,800
法官大人  本案并非基于
Your Honor, this case doesn't hinge

780
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,240
弗兰克・加洛的证词
on the word of Frank Gallo.

781
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,590
而是基于一位美国检察官的证词
It hinges on the word of a U.S. Attorney

782
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,190
而且该检察官曾有足够证据怀疑
who had reason to suspect abuses were taking place

783
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,970
这些所谓的正直监狱虐待犯人
at these supposedly upstanding prisons.

784
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,460
法官大人  那份文件不可采用
Your Honor, that file is inadmissible.

785
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,460
证据开示程序中我们没有见到
We weren't presented with it during discovery.

786
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,610
格雷迪先生  如果你这是故意...
Mr. Grady, if this is some sort of end-around--

787
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,180
法官大人  请您看看这份文件
Your Honor, if you'll look at the file,

788
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,460
你会看到我是昨天才收到的
you can see it was delivered to me yesterday.

789
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,080
所以除非辩方律师认为美国检察官
So, unless opposing counsel feels the U.S. Attorney

790
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,010
伪造了日期  那么这份文件就可以采用
was fabricating that date, that file is admissible.

791
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,020
斯特林小姐  除非你有其他原因
Ms. Sterling, unless you have another reason

792
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,190
支持本案不应继续进行
as to why this case shouldn't move forward,

793
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,460
否则我只能允许了
I'm inclined to allow it.

794
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,070
我有足够的理由  法官大人
I have a compelling reason, Your Honor.

795
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,270
-你是谁  -我叫亚历克斯・威廉姆斯
- And who are you? - My name is Alex Williams.

796
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,050
法官大人  此人无权参与本案
Your Honor, this man has no standing in this case.

797
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,980
我不同意  因为我有份具约束力协议
I beg to differ, because I have a binding agreement

798
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,070
由他们的法律诊所签署  表示他们
signing by his legal clinic stating they would have

799
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,780
在本案上绝不接受皮尔逊-斯佩克特-
no outside help from Pearson Specter Litt

800
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,660
-利特的帮助  他们违约了  -你没有证据
- on this case, yet they did. - You have no proof of that.

801
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,980
那不如你上证人席  宣誓作证
Then how about I put you on the stand, swear you in,

802
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,650
-我再来问你这问题  -没有理由
- and ask you myself? - There is no basis

803
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,700
也没有先例允许你这么做
for you doing that, there is no precedent for you doing that,

804
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,620
我也绝对不会被人胁迫作证
and I'm not gonna get bullied to getting up on the stand.

805
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,410
而且我要说清楚  法官大人  法庭
And for the record, Your Honor, the court cannot make

806
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,200
无权因为我拒绝作证对我产生偏见
any inferences based on me choosing not to go up there.

807
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,390
那不如我让迈克・罗斯出庭作证
Then how about I put Mike Ross on the stand?

808
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,340
我看到他就坐在那里
I notice he's sitting right over there.

809
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,490
我现在没有给他的传票
I don't have a subpoena for him,

810
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,240
但我相信申请一张并不难
but I'm sure we can whip one up.

811
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,520
等他上了证人席
And when he gets up there,

812
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,890
我们再看看他有没有说实话
we'll see if he tells the truth or not.

813
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,230
-法官大人  -够了
- Your Honor-- - That's enough.

814
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,900
法官大人  我是违反了协议
Your Honor, I violated the agreement.

815
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,490
那我没有选择  只能撤销本案
Then I have no other choice but to dismiss this case.

816
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,980
你没事吧
Hey. You okay?

817
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,340
我很好  怎么了
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

818
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,840
显示昨天我进来时你的表情
First, the way you were when I walked in last night

819
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,930
现在我跟你说了传票的事你又成这样了
and then how you were after I told you about the subpoena.

820
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,310
我只是担心路易  瑞秋
Well, I was just worried about Louis, Rachel.

821
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,660
他被起诉了  我觉得我有责任
He's being sued, and I feel partially responsible

822
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,070
因为是我当着
because I'm the one who admitted

823
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,620
新律师的面承认他确实做错了
in front of the associates that he was wrong.

824
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,510
我认识你的这么长时间
And I've known you long enough to know

825
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,090
也足够我判断你什么时候在骗我了
when you're not being straight with me.

826
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,100
哈维昨晚跟我说他有了恋人
Harvey told me he's involved with somebody last night.

827
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,660
-认真的吗  -很认真
- Is it serious? - Yes.

828
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,150
这才是你没想到的会发生的那件事
And that's the news you should have seen coming.

829
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,000
-是的  -唐娜  你只是凡人
- Yes. - Donna, you're only human,

830
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,480
我知道你对人心的解读出神入化
and I know you have this amazing ability to read people,

831
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,110
但有时候有些事你也会忽略
but some things are gonna slip by even you once in a while.

832
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,240
我没有忽略这件事  瑞秋
This one didn't slip by, Rachel.

833
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,930
我没想到会发生  是因为我不想去想
I didn't see it coming 'cause I didn't want to see it.

834
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,500
我总说我希望哈维幸福  我也真的希望
I've always said that I want Harvey to be happy, and I do.

835
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,920
但这件事还是困扰着你
But it bothers you.

836
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,360
而且我讨厌这种感觉
And I hate that it does.

837
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,630
结果他告诉我的时候  我还假装已经知道了
And then when he told me, I pretended I already knew,

838
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,660
这件事更让我郁闷
and I hate that even more.

839
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,490
我不知道该说什么了
I don't know what to say.

840
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,170
我都不知道希望你对我说什么
I don't even know what I'd want you to say.

841
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,440
你说米歇尔・罗斯和哈利艾特・斯佩克特
What do you say Michelle Ross and Harriett Specter

842
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,540
这周再出去喝一次酒怎么样
go out for a drink this week?

843
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,820
谢谢  瑞秋  我很乐意
Thanks, Rachel. I'd like that.

844
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,500
你告诉他了是不是
You told him, didn't you?

845
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,050
你说什么呢  告诉谁什么了
What are you talking about? Told who what?

846
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:10,640
别糊弄我
Don't bullshit me. 

847
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,460
你告诉亚历克斯我在办监狱案了
You told Alex I was working the prison case. 

848
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,030
我什么也没告诉亚历克斯
I didn't tell Alex shit.

849
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,370
我只是让你放弃这个案子
What I did was I told you to drop it.

850
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,880
我也放弃了  我一眼都没有再看
And I did. I didn't spend one more second working on it,

851
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,130
完全遵从了你的命令
just like you ordered me to.

852
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,110
那你来找我闹什么
Then what the hell is your problem?

853
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,780
因为他刚刚出现在法庭
My problem is he just showed up to the courtroom

854
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,000
毁掉了整个案子
and blew up the case.

855
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,050
他羞辱了我们  羞辱了我
He embarrassed us, he embarrassed me,

856
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,340
当着庭上所有人的面
and he did it in front of everyone.

857
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,190
法庭  你不是说你不参与了吗
The courtroom? I thought you said you weren't involved.

858
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,750
我只是坐在后面
I was sitting in the back watching.

859
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,980
没有法律禁止  而且这不是重点
There's no law against that, and that is not the point.

860
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,870
不重点是你随便就判断
No, the point is you went from A to Z

861
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,410
是我告诉了他
and assumed that I told him.

862
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,320
不是你那他是怎么知道的
How the hell else would he know?

863
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,620
我怎么知道的跟你没关系
It's none of your damn business how I knew.

864
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,710
没你的事  这是我跟哈维的事
No, no, this is between me and Harvey.

865
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,820
错  这是我跟你之间的事
Wrong, this is between me and you

866
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,570
因为是你打破了和我委托人的协议
because you broke your agreement with my client.

867
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,590
我不管我干了什么
I don't care what I did.

868
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,920
你没有必要公开羞辱我们
You didn't have to do that publicly.

869
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,040
不是我想这么干  是你逼我的
I didn't make that decision. You did.

870
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,910
胡扯  你完全可以私下找我
Bullshit, you could have come to me privately.

871
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,190
我们可以谈谈这件事
We could've had a conversation.

872
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,480
这事一开始我就是这么做的
I did it when this thing started,

873
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,040
-我不打算再来一次  -混蛋
- and I'm not doing it again. - You son of a bitch.

874
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,020
他说的没错
He's right. 

875
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,080
什么
What?

876
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,830
亚历克斯是对的  是你逼他的
Alex is right, you gave him no choice.

877
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,740
该死的  哈维  是监狱有问题
God damn it, Harvey, that prison is doing shady shit.

878
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,300
他的委托人不在乎是因为他们眼里只有钱
His client doesn't care because all they care about is money.

879
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,850
而且你签协议时就知道
And you knew that when you handed it off

880
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,460
-但你还是答应了  -这件事的重点是
- and said you'd live by it. - This is about you

881
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,820
-你去法庭...  -够了  事已至此
- coming into a courtroom and-- - Okay, that's it! It's done.

882
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,950
我永远不想再听到你们再提起
I don't want to hear another word about Reform Corp

883
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,370
兰伯特惩教所或者马斯特森建筑公司
or Masterson Construction ever again.

884
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,560
你做出了决定  就要承担后果
You made your bed. Now you're gonna sleep in it.

885
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,670
唐娜  你有时间吗
Donna, you have a minute?

886
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,670
路易  如果你是来为了我对
Louis, if you're here to berate me for what I said

887
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,330
斯特芬妮说的话指责我  那没时间
to Stephanie, then, no, I don't.

888
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,820
我不是为此而来
Uh, that is not why I'm here.

889
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,240
我来是想跟你说句对不起
I came to tell you that I'm sorry

890
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,590
我很抱歉几周前没有听你的话
that I didn't listen to you weeks ago.

891
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,370
你具体是指哪次没听我的话
You're gonna have to be a little more specific.

892
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,430
你一直跟我说我应该直面塔拉的事
You kept telling me that I wasn't dealing with Tara.

893
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,900
我终于走出了这一步  而且我想正是因此
Well, I finally started, and I think because of that,

894
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,790
我才终于能够放下愤怒
it allowed me to get past my anger

895
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,580
和斯特芬妮和解了
and make peace with Stephanie.

896
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,590
我很高兴你这么说  路易  我为你骄傲
I'm glad to hear it, Louis. I'm proud of you.

897
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,660
所以  真希望我早点听了你的话
Like I said, I wish I had listened to you sooner.

898
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,700
但正是你一点一点的打破了
But every bit of you hammering away

899
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,600
我否认的高墙我才最终推倒了它
at my wall of denial is what finally brought it down.

900
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,320
所以我是来跟你说谢谢的
So I'm here to tell you thank you...

901
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,120
因为现在我终于觉得
Because now I feel like I can finally

902
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,380
我能继续我的生活了
move forward with my life.

903
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,000
不客气  路易
You're welcome, Louis.

904
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,660
我想这意味着你终于准备好了
And I think that this means that you're officially ready.

905
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,270
-准备好什么  -重新接管新律师
- Uh, for what? - To take back the associates.

906
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,050
唐娜  不用  我很感激
Okay, Donna, no, I appreciate that.

907
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,210
-但他们是你的了  -他们从来都不是
- But they're yours now. - They were never mine, Louis.

908
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,250
我一直都只是在替你照顾他们
I was always just taking care of them for you.

909
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,400
我真不知道该如何报答你
I don't know how I can repay you.

910
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,660
你已经报答我了
You just did.

911
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,270
路易  如果你是来要史蒂文森的简报
Louis, if you're here for the Stevenson brief,

912
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,530
我明天一早就能交给你
I can have it to you in the morning.

913
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,620
回家吧  布莱恩
Go home, Brian.

914
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,580
我被解雇了吗
Am I fired?

915
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,000
不  只是工作并非生活的全部
Nope, there's just more to life than working here.

916
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,100
这是恶作剧吗
Am I being punked?

917
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,130
完全不是
No, not at all.

918
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,670
只是从明天开始你就有新上司了
It's just that you have a new supervisor starting tomorrow,

919
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,280
他希望你今晚能好好休息
and he would like you to get a good night's sleep.

920
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,540
然后他居然让你来通知我
And he told you to tell me that?

921
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,360
天哪  布莱恩  拜托  能配合点吗
Oh, Jesus, Brian, please, will you work with me?

922
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,720
我就是你的新上司
I'm the new supervisor.

923
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,590
听着  我很抱歉
And listen, I am sorry for saying

924
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,930
用那么恶劣的言辞说你不务正业
all those horrible things to you about undedicated.

925
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,400
我都无法想象你要怎么平衡初为人父
I can't even imagine how you balance being a new dad

926
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,430
和这里堆积如山的工作
with this workload.

927
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,500
那我们明天见了
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

928
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,890
明天见
See you tomorrow.

929
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,040
你走之前  我有东西给你
Before you go, I got you a little something.

930
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,310
{\an8}只需要吐出来

931
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,120
路易  这是两个男人之间
Louis, this is the best onesie

932
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,770
赠送过的最好的一句话了
a man has ever gotten another man.

933
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,150
只要让那小家伙好好穿就好
You just tell the little guy to wear it well.

934
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,170
需要的话随时可以带孩子来上班
And feel free to bring him in whenever you want.

935
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,750
但是还是  先打个电话
But, you know, call first.

936
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,440
毕竟这里还是工作的地方
This is a place of business, for God's sake.

937
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,810
那是什么
What's that?

938
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,960
我早该还你的一样东西...
Something I should have given back to you a long time ago...

939
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,150
你的公寓钥匙
the key to your apartment.

940
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,720
什么意思
I don't understand.

941
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,140
我并非提前知道你和宝拉在一起了  哈维
I didn't know about you and Paula, Harvey,

942
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,070
而且我骗了你
and I kept it from you,

943
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,790
我不想继续瞒着你  因为我很为你开心
and I don't want to keep it from you because I'm happy for you.

944
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,620
-唐娜  -我说过我想要更多
- Donna-- - I said I wanted more,

945
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,040
我也已经得到了
and I got what I wanted.

946
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,720
但当你告诉我你们的事
But when you told me about the two of you,

947
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,910
-有那么一刻  我...  -我理解
- for a second there, I-- - I get it.

948
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,640
-真的吗  -我记得当我知道
- You do? - I remember how it felt

949
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,800
你和史蒂芬・亨特利的事时的感受
when I found out about you and Stephen Huntley.

950
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,690
我之前也告诉过你  我很困扰
And I told you before, it bothered me.

951
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,060
但那并不代表...
But it doesn't mean--

952
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,230
是的
Exactly.

953
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,210
我真的为你感到高兴  哈维
I really am happy for you, Harvey.

954
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,840
谢谢  唐娜
Thanks, Donna.

955
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,420
奥斯卡
Oscar.

956
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,770
是真的吗  今天发生在庭上的事
Is it true, what happened in court today?

957
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,380
-是的  但这只是个小挫折  -挫折
- Yes, but it's only a setback. - Setback?

958
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,930
他们说整个案子都被推翻了
They said they threw out the whole case.

959
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,030
不是推翻了案子  只是我们不能参与了
They didn't throw it out. They just threw us off of it.

960
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,020
这有什么区别
What the hell's the difference?

961
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,790
区别在于这是个有胜算的案子
The difference is it's a good case,

962
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,440
还可以由别人来起诉
and somebody else can still take it.

963
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,730
-我们只要  -别再哄我了
- We just have to-- - Stop bullshitting me!

964
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,320
是你劝我拒绝和解的
Now, you told me to turn down that settlement.

965
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,290
我相信了你  现在都完了
I trusted you, and now it's over.

966
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,020
还没有完  我知道
No, it's not over, and I know I told you

967
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,660
是我劝你拒绝和解  但你也说了
to turn down that settlement, but you told me

968
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,610
你起诉不是为了钱...
you weren't doing this for the money and--

969
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,740
我知道  我说了我为了伸张正义
Yes, I know. I told you I was doing it for justice.

970
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,210
但我也说了我还有一个儿子两个女儿
But I also told you I have a son and two other daughters,

971
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,450
你说愈合心伤的唯一办法
and you convinced me the only way to heal

972
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,650
就是避免让这种事发生在其他人身上
was to keep this from happening to someone else,

973
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,680
现在我一无所有了
and now I have nothing.

974
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,170
没钱  没伸张正义  也没有愈合
No money, no justice, no healing.

975
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,140
奥斯卡  我会弥补这件事的
Oscar, I'm gonna make it right.

976
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,420
等你做到我再相信你
I'll believe that when I see it!

977
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,510
哈维  如果你来是为了今天的事
Harvey, if this is about earlier today,

978
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,070
我很感激你支持了我
I want to thank you for backing me.

979
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,660
确实是关于今天的事  亚历克斯
It is about earlier today, Alex,

980
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,230
但我不是来让你感谢我的
but I'm not here for you to thank me.

981
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,130
什么意思
What are you talking about?

982
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,250
我认真想了迈克的话
I got to thinking about what Mike said,

983
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,570
他是对的
and he was right.

984
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,880
你本来可以安静解决此事  但你没有
You could've done what you did quietly, but you didn't.

985
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,670
哈维...
Harvey--

986
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,860
也就是说  你这样做并非只是为了
Which means this isn't just about you protecting

987
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,370
维护你委托人的利益
your client's interests.

988
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,640
而且是为了保护你自己
It's about you protecting yourself.

989
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,350
所以你还是把实话告诉我吧
So why don't you tell me what's really going on here?
