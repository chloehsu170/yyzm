《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on Suits

8
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,030
我只是想告诉你
I just wanted to tell you

9
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,460
我很感激你跟他和好了
that I appreciate you patching things up with him.

10
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,680
为我爱的人做什么都愿意
I would do anything for the woman that I love...

11
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,840
他们会尽其所能地找我们麻烦
They are gonna come at us any way they can,

12
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,070
而他们一旦动手
and when they do,

13
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,970
出问题的就不是热感应器
it's not gonna be about heat sensors,

14
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,200
而是你了
it's gonna be about you.

15
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,430
但我知道  那公司里除我之外
I know I'm not the only guy in that company

16
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,460
还有人知道感应器全都坏了
that knows those sensors are faulty.

17
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,870
抱歉  你要什么来着
I'm sorry. What is it you need again?

18
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,650
过去六个月以来的所有维修订单
All the maintenance work orders from the past six months.

19
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,990
没有授权我不能给你
I can't let you have that without authorization.

20
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,600
你听说过国家运输管理局吗
Have you heard of the National Transportation Safety Board?

21
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,810
那是你的秘书非法获取证据
That's your secretary unlawfully gathering evidence,

22
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,670
意味着我们根本不会达成和解
which means there will be no settlement of any kind.

23
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,490
明天  我就把这段视频发给地检
And tomorrow, I'm sending this to the district attorney.

24
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,090
你所说的
Your whole story

25
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,220
关于路易把他名字弄上墙的办法都是瞎扯的
about how Louis got his name on the door is bullshit.

26
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,320
杰夫
Jeff.

27
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,180
结束了  杰西卡
It's over, Jessica.

28
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,700
我们结束了
We're done.

29
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,160
难以置信  你真让他们承认过错了
I can't believe you actually got them to admit what they did.

30
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,140
你最好相信  这是跑不了的
You better believe it, because it's happening,

31
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,520
如果没你帮忙  也不会成功
and it wouldn't be happening without you.

32
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,500
你是说如果不是我贪心
You mean without me being greedy.

33
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,300
乔  我没这个意思
Joe, that's not what I was gonna say.

34
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,260
不不  我知道你不觉得
No, no, no, I know that you don't think 

35
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,480
我在乎这些人  但我在乎
I care about these people, but I do.

36
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,870
但我也是个普通工人
But I'm also a working stiff.

37
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,610
我这辈子都在领工资
I go paycheck to paycheck for my whole life,

38
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,920
然后遇上了这种事
and then a thing like this--

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,660
可以扭转你的人生
Could turn your whole life around.

40
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,230
你这样的人可能无法理解
Guy like you might not be able to understand that.

41
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,920
我理解
I understand.

42
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,730
这事定了吗
So it's a done deal?

43
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,980
了结还要几天时间
Might take a few days to finalize,

44
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,910
但没错
but yeah.

45
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,470
这事成了
It's happening.

46
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,180
我保证
You have my word.

47
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,870
你不错  罗斯先生
You're all right, Mr. Ross.

48
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,390
哈维  你晚上只来过几次
Harvey, you know the only times you've been here at night

49
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,510
一次是那顿糟糕的晚宴
were the god-awful dinner party--

50
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,260
还有另一次
And the other time.

51
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,410
这次不是那样
Well, this isn't that.

52
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,680
我想知道自由铁路公司
I want to know why Liberty Rail

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,560
为什么会有你在他们资料室的录像
has a video of you in their file room.

54
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,590
你说什么
What are you talking about?

55
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,200
我是说我们的铁证
I'm talking the fact that our smoking gun

56
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,590
刚刚作废了
just became inadmissible.

57
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,640
-哈维  -你怎么拿到那些文件的
- Harvey-- - How'd you get those documents?

58
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,820
你是问我是否做了违法的事吗
Are you asking if I did something illegal?

59
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,600
我可没有
Because I didn't.

60
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,820
他们去找地检官了
Well, they went to the D.A.,

61
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,400
也就是说他们认为你做了
which means they think you did,

62
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,830
所以我再问你一遍
so I'm gonna ask you one more time,

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,300
你怎么进入他们资料室的
how did you get in their file room?

64
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,350
是他们开门让我进去的
By walking through the door they buzzed open.

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,380
他们为什么那么做
And why would they do that?

66
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,320
因为我是我
Because I'm me.

67
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,640
这什么意思
What the hell does that mean?

68
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,530
意思是  我让那个女的以为
It means that I led the woman to believe

69
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,410
我是华盛顿来的官员
that I was an official from Washington.

70
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,580
让那人相信
Led them to believe it,

71
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,980
还是你自己说的
or flat out told them?

72
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,700
因为前者会毁了我们的案子
Because one kills our case

73
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,490
后者会让你陷入大麻烦
and the other puts you in a world of shit.

74
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,180
哈维  我不傻
Harvey, I'm not an idiot,

75
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,960
我不喜欢别人当我傻
and I don't appreciate being treated like one.

76
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,210
我说了  我没违法  我就没违法
I told you I didn't do anything illegal, and I didn't.

77
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,260
不傻
Not an idiot?

78
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,200
那你为什么要去那儿
What the hell were you doing there in the first place?

79
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,780
-哈维  -是迈克的主意  是吗
- Harvey. - It was Mike's idea, wasn't it?

80
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,600
不  他完全不知道
No, he didn't even know about it.

81
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,060
-你去哪  -去见迈克
- Where are you going? - To see Mike.

82
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,110
我说了  他不知道我要那么做
I told you, he didn't even know I was going to do it.

83
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,480
我不管  他之后绝对是知道的
I don't care, because he sure as hell knew after.

84
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,750
走
Let's go.

85
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,120
我真为你骄傲
I am so proud of you.

86
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,450
我以前也做到过
I've done that before.

87
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,500
不是那个啦
I'm not talking about that.

88
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,470
我是说你的案子
I'm talking about your case.

89
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,430
你有信念  你争取
You believed in it, and you fought for it,

90
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,350
我就喜欢你这点
and I-- I love that about you.

91
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,520
我就喜欢你喜欢我这点
And I love that you love that about me.

92
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,970
有人这么夸你
When a person gives you a compliment like that,

93
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,670
你是要夸回去的
you're supposed to give one back.

94
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,170
我夸了啊
But I just did.

95
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,270
我说喜欢你喜欢我这点
I said that you love that I love that about me.

96
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,320
如果我说
And what if I said I love that 

97
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,790
我喜欢你喜欢我喜欢你这点呢
you love that I love that about you?

98
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,020
你是什么感觉
How would that make you feel?

99
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,010
感觉好累
So tired.

100
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,840
我们都知道你为什么这么累
Well, we both know why you're so tired.

101
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,240
因为我太厉害了
Yeah, because I'm so good.

102
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,670
你不喜欢我这点吗
Don't you love that about me?

103
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,270
你知道唐娜靠撒谎进入了那家公司
You knew Donna bullshitted her way into that company

104
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,100
还让我们使用那些维修订单
and you let us use those work orders?

105
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,440
你怎么知道的
How did you find out?

106
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,610
那不重要
It doesn't matter how I found out.

107
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,630
回答问题
Answer my question.

108
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,890
对  我知道  这有什么  我们赢了
Yes, I knew, but what difference does it make? We won.

109
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,910
我们没赢
We didn't win,

110
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,210
因为伊凡·施密斯有唐娜在他们办公室的视频
because Evan Smith has video of Donna in their offices.

111
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,940
-什么  -她也知道吗
- What? - She know about this too?

112
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,330
哈维  她只是想逼我们
Harvey, she's just trying to strong-arm us.

113
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,540
你听到了没有啊
Are you listening to me?

114
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,570
他们有对方律师的秘书去
They have the opposing counsel's secretary

115
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,630
他们资料室的证据
poking around in their goddamn file room.

116
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,810
如果我是地检官  我肯定会进行调查
If I were the D.A., I'd sure as hell look into it.

117
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,660
-地检官  -没错  地检
- The D.A.? - Yeah, the D.A.

118
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,030
哈维  他们放她进去的
Harvey, they let her in.

119
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,860
是你的说法  他们会说是诈骗
According to you, but they're gonna claim fraud

120
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,870
或偷窃  或其他什么
or theft or any number of things.

121
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,830
你要怎么办
What are you gonna do?

122
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,350
我要和解放弃案子
I'm making a deal to drop this case, 

123
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,060
我要这么办
that's what I'm gonna do,

124
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,110
我一达成协议你就去办文书
and you're gonna file the paperwork as soon as I do.

125
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,580
你要毫不反抗
So you're just gonna let this woman

126
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,100
让这女人勒索你吗
blackmail you without a fight?

127
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,960
没错
You're damn right I am.

128
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,060
哈维  我们还是可以拿下案子并...
Harvey, we can still win this case and clear--

129
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,840
没有案子了
There is no case,

130
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,800
就算有我也不在乎
and I wouldn't give a shit about it if there was.

131
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,820
我在乎唐娜
I care about Donna.

132
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,950
你觉得我不在乎吗
And you think I don't?

133
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,170
你那么在乎她
You care so much for her?

134
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,490
就去起草文件
Then draw up those papers,

135
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,120
因为我要通知伊凡这事结束了
because I'm letting Evan know it's over.

136
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,740
你来做什么
What are you doing here?

137
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,160
我们有麻烦了
We have a situation.

138
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,840
事关律所的命运吗
Is the fate of the firm hanging in the balance?

139
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,420
-不  -那我就不在乎
- No-- - Then I don't give a shit.

140
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,440
你告诉马龙了  是吗
You told Malone, didn't you?

141
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,960
我没来得及
I didn't get a chance to tell him,

142
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,430
他自己先查清楚了
because he had already figured out

143
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,130
我一直在跟他撒谎
that I had been lying to him this whole time.

144
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,570
-我很遗憾  -你遗憾
- I'm sorry. - Oh, you're sorry.

145
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,690
今早我以为我能跟他去度假两周
This morning I thought I was going away with him for two weeks.

146
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,510
现在我都不知道他还会不会再见我
Now I don't know if I'm ever gonna see him again.

147
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,450
他辞职了吗
He quit?

148
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,580
他还没来得及跟我说他的职业计划
He didn't get around to giving me his career plans.

149
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,340
要我去替你跟他谈吗
You want me to talk to him for you?

150
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,490
不  这是我的麻烦
No, this is my mess.

151
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,210
我自己会解决
And I will take care of it myself.

152
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,760
明天再说吧
You can take care of it tomorrow.

153
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,540
现在  我要给你倒杯酒
Right now, I'm making you a drink.

154
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,730
欢乐之歌还是抓蛋狂人
Zipadeedoodah or Grab My Sack?

155
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,060
-什么  -信使服务
- What? - Messenger service.

156
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,090
我们用哪家
Which one do we use?

157
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,090
-我...  -算了
- I-I-- - You know what?

158
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,900
随便用哪家  办妥就行
Use whoever you want. Just take care of it.

159
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,480
路易  你自己不是有秘书吗
Louis, don't you have your own secretary?

160
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,730
诺玛吗  我哪都找不到
Oh, you mean Norma, who I can't find anywhere,

161
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,180
她大概又请假了
who is probably taking the day off again?

162
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,850
去年  她想植树节请假
Last year, she tried to get Arbor Day off,

163
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,120
我叫她去她的树
and I told her to blow a goddamn tree 

164
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,150
给我来上班
and get her ass in here.

165
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,990
告诉你  路易
You know what, Louis?

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,890
这36年来  诺玛才请了4天假
Norma has taken 4 days off in the last 36 years.

167
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,430
你能不能别对她那么苛刻
Why don't you back the hell off of her.

168
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,760
你这是怎么了
What the hell is the matter with you?

169
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,390
你一般会像个四十年代动作片里的无业游民
You usually jump on the Norma bashing train

170
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,400
跳上那辆猛烈批判诺玛的列车
like a hobo in a 1940s action movie.

171
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,660
-抱歉  我只是  -怎么了
- I'm sorry, I just... - What?

172
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,040
我扯谎混进自由铁路公司
I bullshitted my way into Liberty Rail

173
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,170
拿了些文件
to get some documents.

174
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
监控录像拍到了我
They caught me on video,

175
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,180
现在他们威胁要起诉
and now they're threatening to press charges.

176
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,850
你怎么不说话
You're not saying anything.

177
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,290
没事  不要紧
It's nothing. It's fine.

178
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,180
那你为什么一副很担心的样子
Then why did you look so concerned?

179
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,850
我很担心  但是他们威胁要起诉
I was concerned, but they're threatening charges,

180
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,070
意味着他们有所图
which means they want something,

181
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,600
我了解哈维  不论他们想要什么
and I know Harvey, and whatever it is they want,

182
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,940
他都会想办法满足他们的
he'll find a way to give it to him.

183
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,650
好吧
Okay.

184
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,820
谢谢  路易
Thanks, Louis.

185
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,010
我帮你搞定那个
I'll take care of your stuff.

186
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,210
不不  你挺忙的
No, no. You have enough on your mind.

187
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,420
我自己搞定吧
I'll take care of it myself.

188
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,700
斯佩克特先生  别开口
Mr. Specter, don't tell me.

189
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,320
我猜你是来谈保尔森女士的事
You're here to talk about Ms. Paulsen.

190
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,620
我是来告诉你  你的意思我懂了
I'm here to tell you you made your point.

191
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,180
我是什么意思
And what point is that?

192
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,080
如果你放弃起诉唐娜
If you drop any charges against Donna,

193
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,650
我们就撤销对你们的诉讼
we'll drop the lawsuit against you.

194
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,470
这好像不太公平
Well, that's not a very even trade.

195
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,890
我是在你机会  让你的当事人摆脱谋杀罪名
I'm giving your client the chance to get away with murder.

196
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,670
据我所知
Last I checked,

197
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,610
我的当事人可没被起诉谋杀
my client wasn't being charged with murder,

198
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,310
我也不需要你放弃诉讼
and I don't need you to drop your suit,

199
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,480
因为罪名根本不成立
because you have no case.

200
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,460
不成立
No case?

201
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,100
你的当事人放任一辆失灵的火车运行
Your client put a faulty train on those tracks,

202
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,780
死了人  而他们从一开始就知道会发生这种事
people died, and they knew it could happen the whole time.

203
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,770
可你没有证据
And you have no proof.

204
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,830
按我们那儿的规矩
And where I come from,

205
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,020
想让我别再追查  你就得跟我做笔交易
you cut a deal with me to make sure I stop looking.

206
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,060
那我猜我们是从不同地方来的
Then I guess we come from different places,

207
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,460
因为我把录像交给地检
because I didn't give that video to the district attorney

208
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,710
不是为了跟你做交易
to leverage you into a deal.

209
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,680
而是为了彻底击溃你
I did it to blow you out of the water.

210
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,240
这事关一个人的一生
This is a person's life.

211
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,230
也许你派她偷我客户东西之前
Maybe you should have thought of that

212
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,790
就该想到这些
before you sent her to rob my client.

213
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,030
伊凡  我很在意这个女人
Evan, I care about this woman.

214
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,350
听着  我理解
Look, I understand.

215
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,810
她可能已经为你工作了很久
She's probably worked for you for a long time.

216
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,850
也许你们还时不时滚滚床单
Maybe you sleep together once in a while.

217
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,270
但我的工作是尽我所能地
But my job is to defend my client

218
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,820
维护我当事人的利益
to the best of my abilities,

219
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,580
我也正打算这么做
and that's exactly what I'm going to do.

220
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,670
天啊
Holy shit.

221
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,010
你不会已经把支票带来了吧
You can't possiblely have a check already.

222
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,550
我没有支票  乔
I don't have a check, Joe.

223
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,450
我们不得不撤销指控
We have to drop the case.

224
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,050
你说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

225
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,140
我们昨晚还一起喝了酒
We had drinks last night.

226
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,930
是的  昨晚我们手上还有
Yeah, we also had proof last night,

227
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,900
而现在  没有了
and now we don't.

228
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,940
-为什么  -事情很复杂
- Why not? - It's complicated.

229
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,590
你知道  很多繁琐的法律程序
You know, it's a lot of legal rigmarole...

230
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,640
少用高人一等的口气跟我说话
Hey, don't talk down to me. 

231
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,370
我没有用高人一等的口气跟你说话
I'm not talking down to you.

232
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,360
但我也没法站在这
But I'm also not gonna stand here

233
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,630
跟你解释民事诉讼程序
and explain civil procedure.

234
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,630
也许我是不懂民事诉讼程序
Maybe I don't understand civil procedure,

235
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,040
但如果事有蹊跷
but I know enough to understand 

236
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,360
我还是能看出来的
when something doesn't add up.

237
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,940
我们拿到证据的方式不正当
We got the evidence the wrong way.

238
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,090
那就用正当的方式啊
Well, get it the right way.

239
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,860
传唤之类的
Subpoena it or something.

240
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,820
我不能
I can't.

241
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,950
你说不能是什么意思
What do you mean, you can't?

242
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,700
那笔钱可以改变我的人生
That money was gonna change my life.

243
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,070
如果你想找其他律所
And if you want to go to a different law firm,

244
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,000
我也可以理解
I understand.

245
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,890
你跟我一样清楚
You know as well as I do 

246
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,710
没有别的律所会接手这个案子
nobody else is gonna take this case.

247
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,990
你说过  你在意那些人
You told me you cared about these people.

248
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,720
你向我保证过
You gave me your word.

249
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,370
是的  我也希望我能遵守诺言
Yeah, and I wish I could keep it.

250
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,440
我想惩罚那些混蛋  跟你想要钱的心情一样迫切
I want those bastards as much as you want this money,

251
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,600
但我没有证据
but I've got no proof,

252
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,730
而你也不是一个可信的证人
and you're not a credible witness.

253
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,800
-你又在这胡扯  -我没有胡扯
- Oh, that bullshit again. - That's not bullshit.

254
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,500
如果最开始你就跟我实话实说
If you had been straight with me from day one,

255
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,060
我们甚至不会陷进这个烂摊子
we wouldn't even be in this mess.

256
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,630
他们给你多少钱让你放弃这个案子
How much did they give you to dump the case?

257
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,880
肯定不少吧
Had to be something.

258
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,850
否则你不会出卖我的
Otherwise, you wouldn't sell me out.

259
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,920
很抱歉  乔  都结束了
I'm sorry, Joe. It's over.

260
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,260
你抱歉吗
You're sorry?

261
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,430
杰西卡
Jessica.

262
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,450
有事吗
Do you need something?

263
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,550
我来过一趟  你不在
I came by earlier, and you weren't in.

264
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,460
我有个会  我不认为
I had a meeting, and I really didn't think 

265
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,100
你会对我的日程感兴趣
you wanted to be looped in on my schedule.

266
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,030
当然不  我不是来检查工作的
I don't, and I'm not checking up on you.

267
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,410
我只是不知道你来没来
I just didn't know if you were coming in.

268
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,780
你是说  你不确定我还来不来上班
You mean you weren't sure if I was ever coming in again.

269
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,870
你不是第一个因为私人原因
You wouldn't be the first person to leave a job

270
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,050
而辞掉工作的
for personal reasons.

271
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,890
听起来你已经有决定了
It sounds to me like you have an agenda.

272
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,460
-没有啊  -这可真稀奇
- I don't. - Well, that's a first.

273
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,640
你是说我来这儿就是为了逼你离开吗
Are you saying that I came here to push you out?

274
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,300
我是说  我还真不知道
I'm saying that I've never known you

275
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,380
你会不知道自己想要什么
not to know what you want.

276
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,120
我想要谈谈我们的事
What I want is to talk about us,

277
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,780
但你好像不想
but you don't seem to want to do that,

278
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,810
所以我只能专注于别的事
so I'm focusing on this.

279
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,250
我是不会在昨天发生的那些事之后
I'm not resigning my senior partnership

280
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,270
第二天立刻词去资深合伙人的
the day after what happened happened,

281
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,490
如果你想问这个的话
if that's what you're asking.

282
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,130
我想问  你打算辞职吗
I'm asking if you plan to resign it at all.

283
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,360
这个我没法回答  因为我也不知道
And I can't tell you that right now, because I don't know.

284
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,840
那么你什么时候能知道
Well, when will you know?

285
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,120
听着  杰西卡  你是经营合伙人
Look, Jessica, you're the managing partner,

286
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,320
所以如果你想让我离开  那随便你
so if you want to push me out, push me out,

287
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,200
但是如果你问我  我想怎么样
but if you're asking me what I want to do,

288
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,410
我的回答是  我还没决定
I'm telling you that I haven't decided.

289
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,930
怎么样
How did it go?

290
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,860
不要在意那些
Never mind how it went.

291
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,750
迈克呢  他起草文件了吗
Where's Mike. Did he file those papers?

292
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,160
我  我不知道  他还没来呢
I-I-I don't know. He's not even in yet.

293
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,020
告诉他  什么都不用写了
Well, you tell him not to file anything,

294
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,920
告诉他  不论他要对那女人做什么
and you tell him to do whatever he has to

295
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,040
尽管放手去做
stick it to that woman.

296
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,850
为什么
Why?

297
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,570
因为不管用
Because it didn't work.

298
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,360
什么不管用
What didn't work?

299
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,030
我试图跟伊凡做个交易
I tried to make a deal with Evan to trade the case.

300
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,060
你是说你要为了我撤销指控
You mean you offered to drop the case in exchange for me.

301
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,440
是的
Yes.

302
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,380
那现在我们要做什么
And now what are we gonna do?

303
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,380
你什么都不用做
You're not gonna do anything.

304
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,760
我要用尽各种手段
I'm gonna do whatever I have to

305
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,770
让泰伦斯·沃尔夫让步
to get Terrance Wolf to back off.

306
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,220
哈维  地方检察官不可能
Harvey, there's no way the D.A. 

307
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,330
只是因为我为你工作
handles a case like this himself

308
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,350
就亲自处理这样的案件
just because I work for you.

309
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,420
他亲不亲自接手都没关系
Whether he handles it himself or not doesn't matter,

310
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,820
因为再过一个小时  这案子就不存在了
because this case won't even exist in another hour.

311
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,470
事情怎么样
How did it go?

312
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,270
我刚刚跟一个人说
I just told a man that everything

313
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,300
我之前的承诺都不算数了
I promised him was bullshit.

314
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,280
你觉得事情会怎么样
How do you think it went?

315
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,320
迈克  我很遗憾
Mike, I'm sorry.

316
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,010
你真应该看看他当时的表情
Oh, you should have seen his face.

317
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,090
那笔钱本会改变他的生活
That money was gonna change his life,

318
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,200
可我又当着他的面把他的希望打碎了
and then I dangled it in front of him and ripped it away.

319
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,450
但这不是你的错
Yeah, but it's not your fault.

320
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,310
你已经尽力了
You did everything you could.

321
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,870
他说我出卖了他
He accused me of selling out.

322
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,070
你知道你没有
You know you didn't do that.

323
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,060
我真的没有吗
Didn't I?

324
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,820
我们之所以放弃是因为...
We gave up because--

325
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,170
因为我吗
Of me?

326
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,270
我不是这个意思
That's not what I was gonna say.

327
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,060
你就是
Yeah, it was.

328
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,690
我本来要说是因为哈维的
No, I was gonna say because of Harvey.

329
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,950
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

330
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,420
哈维一开始就不想接这个案子
Harvey never wanted to take this case,

331
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,270
所以他一直催着我放弃
so he put a clock on it to get me to drop it.

332
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,970
这就造成了我们现在的局面
That's why we're where we are right now.

333
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,640
听我说  哈维现在就在外面
Listen to me; Harvey is out there right now

334
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,290
拼了老命地在想办法补救
busting his ass to fix everything.

335
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,030
不  唐娜
No, Donna.

336
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,160
他根本就不在乎这个案子  从没在乎过
He doesn't give a shit about this case, and he never did.

337
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,900
那他为什么让我来告诉你
Then why did he send me here to tell you to do

338
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,880
要你不择手段对付伊凡·施密斯
everything you can to stick it to Evan Smith?

339
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,150
她没接受我们的条件  对吧
She didn't take the deal, did she?

340
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,850
她没接受
No, she didn't.

341
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,530
唐娜  我很遗憾
Donna, I'm sorry.

342
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,880
我忘了你还...
I didn't realize that you were still--

343
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,930
身处窘境吗
On the hot seat?

344
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,550
就像我说的  哈维正在想办法
Like I said, Harvey's busting his ass to fix it,

345
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,500
那就是说他会解决好
which means he's gonna fix it.

346
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,240
现在  去了结这一切
Now, finish what we started 

347
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,970
想办法打赢这场官司
and figure out a way to win this case.

348
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,410
哈维·斯佩克特
Harvey Specter.

349
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,120
我还在想你会什么时候来呢
I was wondering when you would show up.

350
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,330
呵呵  我还在想你为什么
That's funny; I was wondering why

351
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,560
从来没给我寄过圣诞贺卡呢
you never sent me a Christmas card.

352
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,260
看起来你一点也不担心
You don't seem the least bit worried about 

353
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,010
对你秘书的指控
the pending charges against your secretary.

354
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,660
当然不担心  她又没做错事
I'm not, because she did nothing wrong.

355
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,690
你知道我是怎么想的吗
Well, you know what I think?

356
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,350
我觉得要是她真是清白的  你就不会来了
I think you wouldn't be here if she did nothing wrong.

357
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,240
听我说  她什么也没偷
Listen to me. She didn't steal anything.

358
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,280
她说服他们放她进去  才拿到的文件
She got those documents by convincing them to let her in,

359
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,400
这不是犯罪
and that is not a crime.

360
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,210
上一次你来我办公室的时候
And the last time you were in my office,

361
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,050
你说你没有为了达到目的
you told me you hadn't committed a crime 

362
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,880
而触犯法律
to get the job done.

363
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,890
我告诉过你  你错抓无辜
After I told you you had an innocent man,

364
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,800
可你只在乎程序
and all you cared about was procedure.

365
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,320
我只在乎法律
All I cared about was the law.

366
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,830
要是你真这么关心犯法的人
Well, if you're so concerned with people breaking the law,

367
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,630
怎么不去看看那些文件
why don't you take a look at those documents?

368
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,610
因为它们证明了自由铁路公司确实犯罪了
Because they prove Liberty Rail actually committed a crime,

369
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,900
而唐娜  只是因为为我工作而受到牵连
unlike Donna, whose only crime is working for me.

370
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,890
我调查她不是因为她为你工作
I'm not investigating her for working for you.

371
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,290
而是因为诈欺罪
I'm investigating her for felony fraud.

372
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,470
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

373
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,430
那个放她进去的女的一口咬定
The woman that let her in swears your secretary told her

374
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,390
你秘书说自己是国家运输管理局的人
she was with the National Transportation Safety Board.

375
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,230
那可是联邦机关
That's a federal agency,

376
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,970
那说法就不算是使小伎俩了
which makes what she did not a trick.

377
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,000
而是诈欺
It makes it felony fraud.

378
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,700
到我办公室来  马上
My office. Now.

379
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,490
关门
Close the door.

380
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,420
哈维  怎么了
Harvey, what happened?

381
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,150
怎么了  你骗了我
What happened is, you lied to me.

382
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,930
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

383
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,680
你告诉他们的秘书你是国家运输管理局的人
You told their secretary you were with the NTSB?

384
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,590
-那不是我的原话  -胡扯
- That's not what I said. - Bullshit.

385
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,480
你骗我的时候我就知道你在胡扯
I know when I've been lied to.

386
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,740
现在马上给我说清楚
Come clean right now.

387
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,590
我...
I--

388
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,390
他妈的马上不懂吗
Right the hell now. 

389
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,700
我没说过我是他们的人
I never said I was with them.

390
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,040
原话是  "你有没有听说过"
I said, "Have you ever heard of

391
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,130
"国家运输管理局"
the National Transportation Safety Board?"

392
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,830
有什么区别吗
How is that any different?

393
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,390
-对不起  我...  -对不起有屁用
- I'm sorry, I-- - You're sorry?

394
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,570
哈维  我真不知道这么说是犯法的
Harvey, I swear I didn't know that that made it a crime.

395
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,270
我明确问你的时候你就知道了
You knew when I point-blank asked you,

396
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,000
但是你对我说了谎
and you lied to me about it.

397
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,550
我以为你会处理好的
Well, I thought that you would take care of it.

398
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,550
要是你连实话都不告诉我
How can I take care of it

399
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,070
我怎么能处理好
if you don't tell me the goddamn truth?

400
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,800
你以为我不想实话实说吗
Do you think that I didn't want to tell you the truth?

401
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,370
-那你为什么不说  -因为我很惭愧
- Then why didn't you? - Because I was ashamed.

402
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,310
我知道这听起来很傻
I know that it sounds stupid,

403
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,180
但是你和迈克他们  总能像变戏法那样
but you and Mike and everyone pull these rabbits

404
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,700
想出一个又一个办法
out of your hats all the time,

405
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,880
而我却只能坐在外面接电话
and I just sit outside, and I answer the phones.

406
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,390
可是我搞到了这些文件  人们就把我当救星
And then I got those documents, and people said I saved the day.

407
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,630
还没等我反应过来  你就已经在我面前
And the next thing I knew, you were on my doorstep

408
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,610
像看罪犯一样看着我
coming at me like I was some sort of criminal,

409
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,830
我被吓到了  所以我撒谎了
and I panicked, and I lied.

410
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,500
-唐娜  -对不起  哈维
- Donna-- - I'm sorry, Harvey.

411
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,750
我知道  但这导致
I know you are, but this just got

412
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,300
我摆脱这事的难度上升了一千倍
1,000 times harder for me to get out of.

413
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,480
你是指帮我摆脱这件事吧
You mean for you to get me out of.

414
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,830
唐娜  到现在你最该知道
Donna, you of all people should understand by now

415
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,760
对于我来说  我们不分彼此
that to me they're the same thing.

416
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,570
你来这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

417
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,370
我去你单位找你  他们说你请了病假
I went to see you at work. They said you called in sick.

418
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,100
我说了  你来干嘛
I said, what are you doing here?

419
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,960
我想告诉你个好消息
I wanted to tell you the good news.

420
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,820
我不会放弃你的案子了
I'm not dropping your case after all.

421
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,650
你高兴就好
Good for you.

422
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,580
乔
Hey, Joe.

423
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,810
我知道你觉得自己被耍了
I know you've been jerked around,

424
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,950
但是事情会改变的
but things are gonna change.

425
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,920
会改变吗  真的吗
Gonna change? Really?

426
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,270
你不是说拿到证据的方式不正当吗
I thought you said you got the evidence in the wrong way.

427
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,040
可你不是说用正当的方式就好了吗
Well, and you said we should get it in the right way,

428
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,730
而这正是我们要做的
so that's exactly what we're gonna do.

429
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,520
我说过了  你爱咋地咋地  与我无关
Like I said, good for you, but you're not gonna do it with me.

430
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,490
乔
Hey, Joe.

431
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,260
没有正当委托人  我不能传唤那些记录
I can't subpoena those records without the legitimate client.

432
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,550
要是这么做的话  我根本没有立场
I have no basis and no standing to move forward if I did.

433
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,390
现在你有时间来跟我解释程序问题了
Oh, now you have time to explain procedure to me, right?

434
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,290
好  是我活该
Okay, fine. I deserved that.

435
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,660
但是  这个案子不能没有你  乔
But, Joe, this case cannot move forward without you.

436
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,160
你在放弃我之前就应该想到这些的
You should have thought of that before you cut me loose.

437
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,380
他们来找你了对吧
They got to you, didn't they?

438
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,700
付了你封口费
They gave you a few dollars to shut you up,

439
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,260
跟你达成了无罪协议
and then they sealed the agreement with no admission of guilt.

440
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,570
你知道吗
You know what?

441
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,640
我不能议论这件事  你也知道原因
I can't comment on that, and you know why,

442
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,720
但是有一点我们得说清楚
but let's get one thing straight.

443
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,090
不是他们让我闭的嘴  是你
They didn't shut me up; you did.

444
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,510
就算我接受了什么
And if I took anything,

445
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,220
那也是因为我没有选择的余地
it was because I had no other choice.

446
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,140
乔  听我说
Joe, listen to me.

447
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,730
如果支票还没有兑现  我们还有机会
If the check hasn't cleared, we can still get out of it.

448
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,530
不要再来这里了
Don't come by here anymore.

449
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,100
你对那些人的在乎也就这么多嘛
So much for really caring about those people.

450
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,790
见鬼去吧
Go to hell.

451
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,090
谁把小宝贝安排到角落坐了
I thought nobody puts baby in the corner.

452
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,430
我怎么成了"小宝贝"
Since when am I "Baby"?

453
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,830
你坐在角落里啊
Since you're sitting in the corner.

454
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,430
你通常都是众人瞩目的女生
You're usually a power table kind of girl.

455
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,530
今晚我不是
Well, I'm not tonight.

456
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,880
杰西卡  怎么了
Jessica, what's going on?

457
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,160
我和杰夫结束了
It's over between me and Jeff.

458
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,020
什么  怎么回事
What? What happened?

459
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,850
不重要了
It's not important.

460
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,960
昨天他打电话给我说要带你去巴黎
One day the man is calling me about taking you to Paris,

461
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,100
今天就结束了
and the next it's over,

462
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,580
这么大转变的原因还不重要
and the reason for all that isn't important?

463
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,030
不  因为现在
No, it isn't, because right now,

464
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,160
我得决定他是否该留在律所里
I have to decide whether he should stay at the firm.

465
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,150
那我得说这分手的原因很重要
Well, then I'd say the reason that you broke up is important.

466
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,850
我现在不想谈这个
And I don't want to get into it right now,

467
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,560
木已成舟
because it's not going to change.

468
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,960
这话很耳熟啊
Wow, heard that before.

469
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:24,560
丽娅  我跟爸爸不一样  别再说我像了
Leah, I'm not like Dad, and I'm tired of hearing it.

470
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,430
我知道你总说你不像他
I know you always say you're not like him,

471
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,140
但你现在不去挽回你爱的人
but here you are scrubbing up for the next surgery

472
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,930
反倒像他一样在准备下一场手术了
instead of fighting for the man that you love.

473
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,240
你知道吗
You know what?

474
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,230
大多数姐妹会说  "真遗憾  杰西卡"
Most sisters would say, "I'm sorry, Jessica,"

475
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,860
然后给我一个拥抱
and then give me a hug.

476
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,280
杰西卡  我很遗憾你受伤了
Jessica, I am sorry that you're hurting,

477
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,700
但如果你想要甜蜜慰藉
and if you want something sugarcoated,

478
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,180
我会帮你点甜点  但我们不是这么扶持对方的
I'll order you dessert, but that is not how we show support.

479
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,570
没错
You're right.

480
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,390
我们扶持的方式是分享想法  那你...
We show it by telling each other what we think, so...

481
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,470
我想的是
And what I think is,

482
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,180
两天前这个男人还爱着你
two days ago, this man loved you.

483
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,420
所以除非你劈腿或者偷了他的钱
So unless you cheated on him, stole from him,

484
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,870
或者杀了人  在我看来你们
or killed somebody, it seems to me the two of you

485
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,690
应该可以想办法挽回这段感情
should be able to get past whatever it is you did do.

486
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,540
乔·亨德森不干了
Joe Henderson backed out.

487
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,480
哈维  你听见我说话了吗
Harvey, did you hear me?

488
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,310
他们花钱封了他的口  我们没案子可告了
They paid him off. We have no case anymore.

489
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,380
现在我有个更大的麻烦
And right now, I have a bigger problem.

490
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,590
唐娜说谎了
Donna lied.

491
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,980
什么意思  她说谎了
What do you mean, she lied?

492
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,330
我是说她不只是混进了档案室
I mean she didn't just bullshit her way into that file room.

493
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,810
她还用了"国家交通安全局"的名头
She used the words "National Transportation Safety Board."

494
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,710
在什么情况下说的
In what context?

495
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,630
在不惜犯罪来帮你的情况下
In the context of committing a crime to help you.

496
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,110
你是在指责我知道她这么做了吗
Are you accusing me of knowing that she did that?

497
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,200
如果你不知道  是因为你不想知道
If you didn't know, it's because you didn't want to know.

498
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,810
哈维  她告诉我她没偷那些文件
Harvey, she told me she didn't steal those things.

499
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,490
我和你一样相信了
I believed her the same way you did.

500
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,170
那你就像她一样说谎了
And you lied just like she did.

501
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,150
我没说谎
I did not lie.

502
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,920
那为什么我问你这些文件哪儿来的之后
Then how come when I asked you where those documents came from,

503
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,660
你怎么一个字没提唐娜的事
you didn't say one word about Donna?

504
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,150
因为如果我说了  你就什么都
Because you wouldn't have listened to another word

505
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,650
听不下去了  我是在完成任务
I said after that, and I was trying to get the job done.

506
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,650
你为了完成任务不惜让她冒险
Well, you got the job done by risking her.

507
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,960
这和你以前让我冒风险有什么不同
And how is that different than all the times you risked me?

508
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,720
因为她和你不同
Because she's different.

509
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,070
哈维  我发誓我不知道
Harvey, I swear I didn't know.

510
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,710
我已经说了  现在麻烦更大了
Well, like I said, right now, I've got a bigger problem.

511
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,240
唐娜会面临诈骗罪指控
Donna's gonna be charged with felony fraud,

512
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,850
她还是有罪的
and she's guilty.

513
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,540
-五要素  -什么
- Five elements. - What?

514
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,550
证明诈骗成立有五个要素
Proving fraud consists of five elements.

515
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,450
好  我知道  但全满足
Okay, I'm aware of that, and they have all of them.

516
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,740
伤害呢
What about injury?

517
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,490
唐娜怎么给自由铁路公司造成伤害了
How did Donna injure Liberty Rail?

518
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,750
-你心知肚明  -我们都清楚
- You know how. - I know, and you know.

519
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
但伊凡·施密斯不会坐在陪审团前
But Evan Smith isn't gonna sit in front of a jury

520
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,070
解释清楚那些档案的意义
and explain why those documents have value

521
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,630
同时又不提她客户面临的刑事指控
without exposing her client to criminal charges.

522
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,620
没有造成损害
And without damages,

523
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,460
唐娜的行为最多只是非法入侵
what Donna did is trespassing at the worst.

524
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,820
你要我怎么做
What do you want me to do?

525
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,640
我要你继续这个民事案件
I want you to stay on the civil case.

526
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,850
哈维  这个案子已经没戏了
Harvey, the lawsuit is dead.

527
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,600
我们没有原告
We don't have a plaintiff.

528
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,550
那就去找一个  因为我不会
Then get another one, because I'm not letting

529
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,960
那个女人得到任何好处
this woman get away with a goddamn thing.

530
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,950
好吧
All right,

531
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,650
我只是出于礼貌见你一下
I'm paying you the courtesy of a meeting.

532
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,720
你有什么想法
What's on your mind?

533
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,610
依他一贯名声看  我敢说
Well, based on his reputation, I would say that

534
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,540
他打算逃避这个起诉
he's going to try to weasel his way out of this.

535
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,860
我是打算帮沃尔夫先生
What I'm going to do is save Mr. Wolf

536
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,670
摆脱在法庭公开受窘的情形
from being embarrassed in open court.

537
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,270
我敢说你这么做没什么附带好处吧
And I'm sure there's no side benefit to you in the process.

538
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,930
你知道你这么做会让史密斯女士
You do know you're gonna have to put Ms. Smith

539
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,880
上证人席对吧
on the stand, right?

540
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,950
你也是啊  所以她才会到这地步
So do you; that's why you had her come down here.

541
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,610
她告诉你唐娜究竟拿了什么东西吗
And did she tell you what Donna actually took?

542
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,510
你告诉我的
You told me what Donna took.

543
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,150
我还告诉你这是用来证明他们犯了罪
And I also told you that it proves they committed a crime,

544
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,490
但她不能这么说  所以唐娜偷的东西
but she can't say that, which means all Donna stole

545
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,380
只是一叠废纸
was a meaningless stack of papers,

546
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,700
没有任何伤害
and without actual damages--

547
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,820
我也懂法律
I know the law.

548
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,050
那你知道你的证人多不靠谱了
Then you know you've got a shitty witness.

549
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,450
是吗
Well?

550
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,320
我不能透露那些文档的细节
I can't get into the details of those documents,

551
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,980
但这不表示那些文件没有价值
but that doesn't mean that they don't have value.

552
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,960
它们当然有价值  替你保命
Of course they have value. The saved you ass.

553
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,380
那是机密文件  有商业秘密
They're confidential. They have trade secrets.

554
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,030
唯一的秘密就是
The only secret that is in there

555
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,660
你们的火车害死人
is that your trains kill people.

556
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,350
好吧  够了
All right, enough.

557
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,120
史密斯女士  如果你不能证明伤害
Ms. Smith, if you can't show damages,

558
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,750
我就没案可立
I have no case.

559
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,790
你不需要损害
You don't need damages.

560
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,830
有意图就够了
You have intent.

561
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,750
如果你真的了解我
And if you really knew my reputation,

562
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,530
你知道我以前在这里干过
you'd also know that I used to work here.

563
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,620
我告诉你在地区检察官的历史上
And I can tell you they've never gone after anyone for intent

564
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,360
就没有仅靠意图就起诉的案例
in the history of the D.A.'s office,

565
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,100
他们现在也不会开此先例
and they're not gonna start now.

566
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,080
很高兴和你打交道  伊凡
It was good doing business with you, Evan.

567
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,280
事情顺利吗
Hey. How are things?

568
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,870
你是说哈维说会
You mean the things that you said that Harvey

569
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,740
搞定的那些事情吗
would take care of?

570
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,420
没错  我就是说那些事
Yes, those are exactly the things I mean.

571
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,200
那些事情
Well, those are exactly the things

572
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,190
哈维的确搞定了
that Harvey just took care of.

573
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,450
是吗
He did?

574
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,290
是的
He did.

575
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,230
路易  怎么了
Louis, what's wrong?

576
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,380
没事
Nothing's wrong.

577
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,500
只是  我知道肯定不可能
It's just... I know it wasn't gonna happen,

578
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,270
但当你告诉我他们要起诉你时
but when you first told me they might press charges,

579
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,440
我不禁想到你被关起来...
the thought of you behind bars...

580
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,590
别这样
Oh, come on.

581
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,870
就算被关也是去轻松的白领罪犯度假地
It just would have been some cushy, white-collar resort.

582
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,890
我可能终于会有机会拿瑜伽认证了
I could have finally gotten my yoga certification--

583
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,160
不会的
It wouldn't have been.

584
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,130
但没关系  因为我说对了
But it doesn't matter, because I was right.

585
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,790
哈维想尽了一切办法
Harvey did whatever it took.

586
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,280
谢谢  路易
Thanks, Louis.

587
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,460
他根本不知道拥有你是多幸运的一件事
God, he doesn't even know how lucky he is to have you.

588
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,460
诺玛还没来  对吧
Norma's still out, isn't she?

589
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,420
她那个天杀的姐姐绊了一跤摔进了浴缸
Her goddamn sister tripped and fell in the tub,

590
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,000
她去帮忙了
and she went to help.

591
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,100
她好像一点都不在乎我
It's like she doesn't even care about me at all.

592
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,480
我知道你不在维修部上班
I know you don't work in maintenance,

593
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,590
但你有权查阅账单
but you do have access to accounts payable,

594
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,880
如果你...
so if you could...

595
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,090
别  拜托  听我...
look--no--hey, please, just hear me...

596
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,360
该死
God damn it.

597
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,070
又一个不接你电话的
Another one wouldn't take your call?

598
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,010
没人会听我说
No, none of them will.

599
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,590
我给整张名单上的人都打过电话
I've been through this entire directory.

600
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,850
只要我一提"车祸""热""感应器"这几个词
As soon as I use the words "Crash," "Heat," Or "Sensors,"

601
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,750
他们就不肯再说了
they all stop talking.

602
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,840
迈克  有人死了
Mike, people died.

603
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,320
一定会有人想要声张正义
Somebody's got to want to do the right thing.

604
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,420
就算有人  我也找不到
Well, if somebody does, I can't find them.

605
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,170
受害者家属呢
Okay what about the victims' families?

606
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,830
你是说最初的原告吗
Oh, you mean the original plaintiffs.

607
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,710
问题是  他们已经和解了
Yeah, the problem is, they already have a settlement.

608
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,900
看看吧
Go on. Look at it.

609
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,910
铁路公司不傻
They weren't stupid.

610
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,730
和解书使受害者家属再也不能追究他们的责任
It prevents them from ever going after them again.

611
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,820
迈克  我只是想帮忙
Mike, I'm just trying to help you.

612
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,770
我知道  抱歉
I know you are. I'm sorry.

613
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,080
我只是很沮丧
I'm just frustrated.

614
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,760
如果找不到新原告  我就没法继续受理此案
If I can't find a new plaintiff, I can't keep this case alive.

615
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,050
等等
Wait a second.

616
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,120
你说公司里没人愿意跟你谈
You said no one at the company will talk to you.

617
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,500
是啊  因为他们都害怕丢了饭碗
They won't, because they're all afraid they'll lose their job.

618
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,770
如果那个人再没什么可以失去的呢
All right, so what about someone who has nothing left to lose?

619
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,310
什么意思
What are you talking about?

620
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,990
我说的是他
I'm talking about him.

621
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,320
我帮你重新安排了之前错过的和莱瑟姆的会面
So I rescheduled the meeting that you missed with Latham

622
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,540
明天下午三点
for 3:00 tomorrow.

623
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,220
这是最新的合同
Here are the newest contracts.

624
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,270
凯西·芬恩就收购的事打电话过来
Also, Kathy Finn called about the takeover,

625
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,240
我给了她最新细则  告诉她稍安勿躁
so I sent her the latest specs, and I told her to sit tight.

626
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,520
我还注意到你桌上左边那支笔没水了
And I noticed the left pen on your desk set was out of ink,

627
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,870
我帮你换了笔芯
so I had the cartridge replaced.

628
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,920
这些事可以在我不在的时候做
You could have done all of this while I was out of the office.

629
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,420
我知道  但那样我就没机会向你道谢了
I know, but then I wouldn't have had a chance to thank you.

630
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,660
唐娜
Donna.

631
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,390
谢谢你  哈维
Thank you, Harvey.

632
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,480
不用谢
You're welcome.

633
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,840
保尔森女士  斯佩克特先生
Ms. Paulsen, Mr. Specter.

634
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,760
泰伦斯  你最好是来代地检署
Terrance, you better be here to give Donna a formal apology

635
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,480
向唐娜正式道歉的
from the D.A.'s office.

636
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,000
不
No.

637
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,880
我是来把这个给她的律师
I'm here to give her lawyer this.

638
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,190
哈维  是什么
Harvey, what is that?

639
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,170
唐娜  你出去
Donna, leave the room.

640
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,380
你可以让她出去
You can tell her to leave.

641
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,310
但别忘了告诉她
Don't forget to tell her

642
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,040
明早九点法庭要传讯她
her arraignment's 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

643
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,210
传讯  因为什么
Arraignment? For what?

644
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,220
你个婊子养的
You son of a bitch.

645
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,320
你把指控改成了意图诈骗
You amended the charges to intent?

646
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,580
你说地检署史上
You said it's never been done

647
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,320
从没这样做过
in the history of the D.A.'s office.

648
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,730
我决定创造历史
I decided to make history.

649
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,270
通过对付一个什么都没偷的人
By going after someone for stealing nothing.

650
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,210
她进去找希望之钻
She went in there to find the Hope Diamond.

651
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,300
就算只带走了一块玻璃
Just because she came out with a piece of glass

652
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,540
也不代表那不是欺诈
doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.

653
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,300
本来就不是
That's exactly what it means.

654
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,970
每次我抓到你
Every time I run into you,

655
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,090
你都说你做下的肮脏勾当
you tell me whatever shady thing just went down

656
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,300
是为了大局  或是根本没做过
was about the greater good or that it didn't happen

657
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,630
或是因为这个  因为那个  但这是犯罪
or this, that, or the other, but a crime was committed here,

658
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,020
我要因此追究她的责任
and I'm going after her for it.

659
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,220
扯淡  你是想对付我
Bullshit. You're going after me.

660
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,430
你是说你没命令她偷东西
Oh, you're telling me you didn't order her to do it.

661
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,710
没有
No, I didn't.

662
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,220
我们会查清楚的
Well, we'll find out...

663
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,100
她即将被判有罪的时候
when she's about to be convicted

664
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,190
我会给她份协议
and I offer her a deal.

665
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,060
现在怎么办
What happens now?

666
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,550
明天去接受传讯
What happens now is, we go in there tomorrow

667
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,710
进行无罪抗辩
and enter a plea of not guilty.

668
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,320
但我有罪
But I am guilty.

669
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,080
唐娜  意图诈骗这种指控根本是无稽之谈
Donna, intent to commit fraud is a bullshit charge,

670
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,840
他只是想借此来吓唬你
and he's just using you to try to scare you.

671
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,810
起码管用  我被吓倒了
Well, it's working. I'm scared.

672
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,940
-唐娜  -可能判什么刑
- Donna-- - What's the punishment?

673
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,580
这不重要  因为我会帮你脱罪
It doesn't matter, because I'm gonna get you out of it.

674
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,300
哈维  会怎么判
Harvey, what's the punishment?

675
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,770
可能判什么刑
Three to five years.

676
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,610
天啊
Oh, my God.

677
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,850
-什么三到五年  -现在没空  路易
- Three to five years for what? - Not now, Louis.

678
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,590
我刚在电梯那看到泰伦斯·沃尔夫
I just saw Terrance Wolf at the elevator.

679
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,610
什么三到五年
Three to five years for what?

680
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,290
他起诉她意图诈骗
He's charging her with intent to commit fraud.

681
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,280
该死
Holy shit.

682
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,800
路易  我不想听
Louis, I don't want to hear it.

683
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,580
你必须听  因为你本应该
Well, you're going to, because you were supposed to

684
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,320
帮她摆脱这摊破事
get her out of this.

685
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,050
你这样于事无补
This isn't helping.

686
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,270
那你以为我之前在干什么
What the hell do you think I've been doing?

687
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,140
不知道  但不管你做了什么  都毫无用处
I don't know, but whatever it is, it didn't do a thing.

688
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,720
你根本不知道你在说什么
You have no idea what you're talking about.

689
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,950
我告诉她你永远不会让她有麻烦
I told her that you were never gonna let her get in trouble.

690
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,990
没这么简单
It's not so simple.

691
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,980
怎么就不简单了
What the hell isn't so simple?

692
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,430
她有罪
She's guilty.

693
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,180
沃尔夫想利用她来对付我
Wolf is trying to use her to turn on me,

694
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,890
因为他认为是我让她做的
because he thinks I put her up to it.

695
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,110
是你吗
Did you?

696
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,670
哈维毫不知情
Harvey didn't even know I did it.

697
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,600
无所谓了
You know what? It doesn't even matter.

698
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,330
-这案子我来办  -不行
- Because I'm taking over. - No, you're not.

699
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,160
他想利用她来对付你
He's trying to get her to turn on you.

700
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,560
你不能当她的律师
You cannot be her lawyer.

701
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,520
她不会背叛我  有什么区别
She's not going to, so what difference does it make?

702
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,540
区别在于
The difference is,

703
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,750
如果你不插手  沃尔夫就会让步
if you're out of the picture, Wolf backs down.

704
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,220
在他看来  我已经牵扯其中
From where he's standing, I'm in the picture,

705
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,550
他不会让步的
and he's never gonna back down.

706
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,140
这可未必  这事关唐娜的人生
You don't know that, and this is Donna's life.

707
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,680
我不会把她的人生交到你手里
And I'm not putting it in your hands.

708
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,960
这不是你能决定的
And it's not your decision to make.

709
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,900
确实  这要唐娜来决定
No, it's not. It's Donna's.

710
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,770
她跟我一伙
And she's sticking with me.

711
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,620
路易  拜托  我知道你想帮忙
Louis, please, I know that you want to help,

712
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,300
但你还是走吧
but just go.

713
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,670
-亚沃尔斯基先生  -是我
- Mr. Jaworski. - Yeah.

714
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,960
我是皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所的迈克·罗斯
My name is Mike Ross. I'm with Pearson Specter Litt.

715
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,920
这位是瑞秋·赞恩
This is Rachel Zane.

716
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,620
我们律所的律师
She's one of our associates.

717
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,820
先生  我们想跟你谈谈那起事故
Sir, we'd like to speak with you about the accident.

718
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,530
我已经做过证了
Look, I was already deposed for that lawsuit.

719
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,870
受害者得到了赔偿
The victims got paid.

720
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,670
我能说的也都说了
I said everything I had to say, okay?

721
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,610
我们不是来追究你
We're not here to come after you.

722
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,470
我们想让你起诉自由铁路公司
We want you to sue Liberty Rail.

723
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,630
是吗  我为什么要起诉他们
Oh, yeah? And why would I sue them?

724
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,620
因为虽然火车是你驾驶的
'Cause while you might have been driving the train,

725
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,440
但事故不是你的错
that accident wasn't your fault.

726
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,260
你在逗我吗
Is this some kind of a joke?

727
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,510
不  先生  不是的
No, sir. It isn't.

728
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,970
他们让你做了替罪羊
They made you the fall guy.

729
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,340
放屁  他们为什么要这么做
Bullshit. Why would they do that?

730
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,640
因为他们得归罪于某人
Because they needed to blame someone,

731
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,530
而你不但是驾驶员
and not only were you at the wheel,

732
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,710
还不记得发生什么事了
you had no memory of what happened.

733
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,600
不  我不相信
Nah, I don't believe it.

734
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,460
他们是家好公司  他们不会这么做的
They're a good company. They wouldn't do this.

735
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,360
亚沃尔斯基先生...
Mr. Jaworski--

736
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,910
听着  是我害死了那些人
Look, I killed those people.

737
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,270
这种情况下他们还同意算我提早退休
And they still gave me early retirement

738
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,490
同时还继续给我发退休金
and let me keep my pension.

739
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,180
他们之所以那样做是为了让你不闹事
The reason they did that was to keep you quiet.

740
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,490
我要你们滚出我家
I need you to get off my property,

741
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,010
你们两个
both of you.

742
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,190
先生  你知道我们说的是真相
Sir, you know that we're telling the truth.

743
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,240
是啊  但是这个真相能帮一个余生
Yeah, well, is the truth gonna support the family of a guy

744
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,070
都无法再找一份工作的人养家糊口吗
who can't get another job for the rest of his life?

745
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,110
假如我们赢了  你就衣食无忧了
If we win, you'll be set up for life.

746
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,450
你们看看我
Ah, take a look at me.

747
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,170
我不是那种能赢的人
I ain't the guy who wins.

748
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,450
我就是那种注定会输的人
I'm the guy who loses.

749
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,890
假如我能保证料理好一切呢
What if I can guarantee to take care of all of that

750
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,600
无论发生什么
no matter what happens.

751
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,260
你们需要我做什么
What would you need me to do?

752
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,330
全体起立
All rise.

753
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,800
你还好吧
You okay?

754
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,510
我要发言吗
Am I gonna have to talk?

755
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,220
你就恭恭敬敬说"法官大人"就好
Just be polite and say "Your Honor."

756
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,810
不等你反应过来一切就结束了
It will be over before you know it.

757
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,220
州地检起诉唐娜·鲍尔森
State versus Donna Paulsen.

758
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,770
辩护律师准备好继续提审了吗
Is the defense counsel prepared to proceed with the arraignment?

759
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,600
准备好了  法官大人
We are, Your Honor.

760
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,310
鲍尔森女士  你被诉
Ms. Paulsen, you have been charged

761
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,310
意图诈骗的重罪
with felony intent to commit fraud.

762
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,370
这将导致最高五年的监禁判决
This carries a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison.

763
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,640
你清楚今天对你的指控吗
Do you understand the charges against you today?

764
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,150
清楚  法官大人
Yes, Your Honor.

765
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,500
你有什么要辩护的吗
How do you plead?

766
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,420
无罪辩护  法官大人
Not guilty, Your Honor.

767
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,410
很好
Very well.

768
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,690
沃尔夫先生  地检准备好进行庭审了吗
Mr. Wolf, is the state ready to go to trial?

769
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,680
准备好了  法官大人
We are, Your Honor.

770
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,560
庭审安排在周一开始
Trial is set to begin Monday.

771
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,130
下一案
Next case.

772
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,000
好了  你的意思我明白了
All right, you made your point.

773
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,840
我们把这案子辩护成轻罪
Let's plead this down to a misdemeanor

774
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,340
然后回去干正事吧
and both go back to our real jobs.

775
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,660
这就是我的正事
This is my real job.

776
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,580
假如你对这个所代表的东西还留有一丝尊敬的话
Maybe if you had a little more respect for what it stands for,

777
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,360
你就不会站在这里了
you wouldn't be standing here.

778
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,930
听着  我要从你自鸣得意的脸上把那个表情抹去
Listen, I'm gonna wipe that look off your smug face.

779
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,710
你尽管试试  哈维
You give it a try, Harvey,

780
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,530
但是我掌握了所需的一切证据
but I've got all the evidence I need.

781
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,900
你得为自己找个新秘书了
You're gonna have to go find yourself a new secretary.

782
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,510
我看你又开始不敲门了
I see you're back to not knocking.

783
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,520
我就当这代表你已经下定决心了
I take it that means you've made up your mind.

784
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,720
的确
I have.

785
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,780
然后
And,

786
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,400
我决定
what I've decided

787
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,020
你那晚将我拒之门外
is that you shut the door on me the other night,

788
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,040
让你来规定我做过什么
and it's not fair for you to dictate 

789
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,830
却不让我申辩是不公平的
what I do and don't get to say.

790
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,390
我早告诉过你了
I told you.

791
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,430
无论你想说什么都不重要
It doesn't matter what you have to say,

792
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,530
因为不管怎样  我都不会相信的
because whatever it is, I won't believe it.

793
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,350
那假如我是来告诉你我爱你呢
Well, what if I was here to tell you that I love you?

794
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,750
杰西卡  你骗了我几个月...
Jessica, you lied to me for months--

795
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,200
杰夫  拜托
Jeff, please.

796
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,690
听我说
Just listen.

797
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,770
我知道我伤害了你
I know I hurt you,

798
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,630
但是是你希望
but you were the one

799
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,560
我们能一起工作  开始一段恋情的
who wanted us to work together and be in a relationship.

800
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,040
而是你觉得这是个错误的
And you were the one who thought it was a mistake.

801
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,700
因为我害怕了
Because I was scared.

802
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,850
但我改变注意了
But I changed my mind,

803
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,870
因为你拒绝放弃
because you refused to give up.

804
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,970
而如今我也拒绝放弃
And now I'm refusing to give up.

805
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,230
我希望你能留在这里
I want you to stay here.

806
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,160
我希望我们能工作感情兼得
I want us to have both.

807
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,590
杰西卡...
Jessica--

808
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,950
你曾经希望我能放下心墙
You wanted me to let my walls down.

809
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,510
现在放下了
Well, they're down.

810
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,820
唐娜  你为什么不回家
Donna, why don't you go home?

811
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,950
你知道我准备上庭时喜欢一个人静静
You know I like to be alone when I'm getting ready for a trial.

812
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,310
我要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

813
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,350
怎么了
What is it?

814
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,950
我觉得路易也许是对的
I think maybe Louis was right.

815
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,530
你觉得路易什么东西对了
You think Louis was right about what?

816
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,800
也许应该让他来接手我的案子
Maybe he should be handling my case.

817
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,480
好吧  假如你这么觉得的话
Okay, well, if that's how you feel.

818
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,520
我知道你会觉得这是侮辱
I knew it; I knew you would take this as an insult.

819
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,240
不然你想让我怎么看
How exactly would you like me to take it?

820
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,640
我希望你能严肃看待
I would like you to take it seriously

821
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,710
并且和我谈谈这件事
and talk about it with me.

822
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,990
好吧  唐娜
Okay, Donna,

823
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,970
你到底为什么想要路易接手
why exactly would you prefer Louis to handle this?

824
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,790
因为我今天去参加那个传讯
Because I sat in that arraignment today,

825
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,660
第一次意识到
and it hit me for the first time

826
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,860
我可能真的要进监狱了
that I might actually go to prison.

827
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,840
而你更在乎攻击泰伦斯·沃尔夫
And you were more concerned with attacking Terrance Wolf

828
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,850
而不是我
than you were with me.

829
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,180
所以你觉得路易是对的
So you think Louis is right.

830
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,700
我把地方检察官惹得太不高兴了
I piss off the D.A. too much.

831
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,550
你今天的确如此
Well, you sure did today.

832
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,920
那是因为他在针对我们
Because he's coming at us.

833
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,530
而你在火上浇油
And you're pouring gas on the fire.

834
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,620
因为那就是我的行事风格
Because that's what I do,

835
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,410
而我不需要你
and I don't need you

836
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,830
在事后走进这里来批评我的工作方式
coming in here second-guessing how I do my job.

837
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,830
哈维  你为什么要攻击我
Harvey, why are you attacking me?

838
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,760
我不是你的敌人
I'm not the enemy.

839
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,160
你现在绝对是了
You sure as hell are right now.

840
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,600
什么  为什么我会是...
What? Why am I the--

841
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,040
因为我正在准备打仗
Because I'm getting ready for a fight,

842
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,450
而你却来告诉我你不觉得我能赢
and you're telling me you don't think I can win.

843
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,380
我不是这个意思
I'm not telling you that.

844
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,840
我是在告诉你我吓坏了
I'm telling you that I'm petrified.

845
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,260
我理解  但我没时间来安慰你
And I understand, but I don't have time to comfort you.

846
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,480
那我需要你挤点时间
Well, I need you to make time.

847
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,340
我做不到  因为...
And I can't, because--

848
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,160
哈维  这是我的人生
Harvey, this is my life!

849
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,950
当我告诉路易你是怎么帮我从这件事里脱身时
When I told Louis how you got me out of this thing,

850
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,050
他告诉我一想到我要进监狱
he told me how scared he was at the thought

851
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,520
他是多么的害怕
of me going to prison,

852
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,510
而我只是...
and I just...

853
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,920
需要...
need...

854
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,760
你...
you...

855
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,530
来...
to--

856
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,050
唐娜  一想到你要进监狱了
Donna, the thought of you going to prison

857
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,450
我就吓得膝盖一软
makes me want to drop to my knees.

858
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,720
你想听我说出来吗
You want to hear me say it?

859
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,010
我说了
There it is.

860
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,360
但那不会发生的
But that's not gonna happen,

861
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,160
因为我不会允许这件事发生的
because I'm not gonna let it happen.

862
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,790
但是要做到这一点
But in order to do that,

863
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,430
你得让我做好我要做的事
you need to let me do what I do.

864
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,630
-哈维...  -够了
- Harvey-- - That's enough.

865
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,390
你想找人给你个拥抱吗
You want someone to give you a hug?

866
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,370
去找路易
Go to Louis.

867
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,200
你想找人帮你从这件事里脱身
You want someone to get you out of this thing,

868
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,840
你就得让我一个人静静
you need to leave me alone.

869
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,280
我要知道你掌握的一切
I need to know everything you have,

870
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
马上就要知道
and I need to know right now.

871
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,830
我们让驾驶员答应了
We got the conductor to sign on,

872
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,380
但是我们得给他...
but we have to give him--

873
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,540
我不在乎我要给他什么
I don't care what I have to give him.

874
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,360
只在乎那能给我们带来什么
What does that give us?

875
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,400
什么意思  能给我们立案的资格
What do you mean? It gives us standing.

876
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,570
现在我们可以用传票传唤那些记录了
Now we can subpoena those records.

877
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,470
那还不够
Well, that's not enough.

878
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,130
-至少是个开始啊  -我要的不是开始
- It's a start. - I don't need a start.

879
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,140
是结果  而且立刻就要
I need a finish, and I need it now.

880
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,780
他们要起诉唐娜了是吗
They're charging Donna, aren't they?

881
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,320
今天早上被传讯的
She was arraigned this morning.

882
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:34,250
如果上庭  我没法保证能赢
If this thing goes to trial, I can't guarantee a win.

883
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,850
那你又要为唐娜放弃这个案子了是吗
So we're back to trading the case for Donna.

884
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,040
是的  而且我不想听你那套
Yeah, and I don't want to hear your moral objections

885
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,420
不该让杀人犯漏网的道德说辞
about those people getting away with murder.

886
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,610
我没打算那么说  哈维
I'm not talking about that, Harvey,

887
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,660
但如果唐娜已经被传讯了
but if Donna was arraigned,

888
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,150
就不是他们撤诉能解决的了
it's not up to them to drop the charges.

889
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,080
决定权在沃尔夫  你知道他不会撤诉
It's up to Wolf, and you know he's never gonna do that.

890
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,930
我不是要让他撤诉
I'm not talking about dropping the charges.

891
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,440
我是要抹掉整个案件
I'm talking about making this whole damn thing go away.

892
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,300
哈维  如果我没理解错
Harvey, if you're saying what I think you're saying,

893
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,810
你这是干扰司法公正
that's obstruction of justice.

894
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,560
在我看来  这才是公正
The way I see it, it's justice.

895
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,370
你知道我的意思
You know what I mean.

896
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,690
我知道  而且我不在乎
I do, and I don't give a shit.

897
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,420
-此事事关唐娜  -好吧  我懂了
- This is Donna. - All right, I get it.

898
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,300
但如果我的材料不够呢
But what if what I have isn't enough?

899
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,710
你自己说的  至少是个开始
Like you said, it's a start.

900
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,990
明天一早我要在桌上见到正式诉状
Have an official complaint on my desk by the morning.

901
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,410
-那你干什么去  -我去弄足够的材料
- And what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna get us enough.

902
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,980
行了  听见了听见了
All right, I hear you. I hear you.

903
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,740
知道我是谁吗
Do you know who I am?

904
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,660
不知道
No.

905
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,850
迈克·罗斯是我的手下
Yeah, Mike Ross works for me.

906
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,380
我不管
Hey, I don't give a shit.

907
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,320
一开始我就跟他说不要接你的案子
I told him not to take your case in the first place,

908
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,800
因为我知道你就是个诈骗犯
because I knew you were a goddamn shakedown artist,

909
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,560
但现在我在乎的人卷进了麻烦
but now someone I care about is in trouble,

910
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,120
就因为你拿钱走人了
because you took a payout.

911
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,230
滚出去
Get out of my face.

912
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,370
听我说
Listen to me.

913
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,730
如果你不听我们的话
If you don't do what we need you to do,

914
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,860
你会倒大霉
I will hurt you.

915
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,320
你最好做好了杀我的准备
You better be prepared to kill me,

916
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,340
因为我绝不会把钱还回去的
because I'm not gonna give that money back.

917
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,330
如果只是钱的问题
Well, if this is just about money,

918
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,870
那就没什么争的必要了
then we don't need to fight at all.

919
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,230
哈维  我都快养成见你的习惯了
Harvey, this is becoming a habit.

920
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,260
我见你比见之前三个男友的次数都多
I've seen you more than my last three boyfriends.

921
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,220
这并不让我意外
Somehow that doesn't surprise me.

922
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,900
你真幽默
You're funny.

923
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,250
我喜欢你
I like you.

924
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,710
但你来恐怕不是为了嘲笑我的恋爱史
But I know you're not here to mock my relationship,

925
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,190
你想说什么
so what's on your mind?

926
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,390
我们想给你这个
We wanted to give you this.

927
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,620
这是什么
What's this?

928
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,670
我们替迈克尔·亚沃尔斯基拟写的诉状
It's the lawsuit we filed on behalf of Michael Jaworski.

929
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,350
就是被你们当作替罪羊的那位
You know, the man you let take the fall for the accident.

930
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,700
迈克尔·亚沃尔斯基不可以上诉
Michael Jaworski can't sue--

931
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,440
什么
What?

932
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,890
起诉你吗  因为你很聪明
Sue you, because you were smart enough

933
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,580
会替他付账吗
to take care of his expenses?

934
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,620
现在替他付账的是我了
Well, now I'm taking care of his expenses.

935
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,010
现在可以立案了
And now we have standing,

936
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,400
我们要传唤你们提供这些文件
and we are going to subpoena those documents.

937
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,740
我是不是该怕的发抖呢
Am I supposed to start quaking in my boots?

938
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,480
当然不  我们知道如果你们能改报告
Nope, we know if you can doctor a report,

939
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,100
这些记录你们也能动手脚
you can alter those maintenance records.

940
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,220
我什么也没有篡改
I didn't alter anything.

941
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,850
乔·亨德森可不是这么说的
Well, that's not what Joe Henderson said.

942
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,960
他说你找到了他  承认了一切
He said you came to him, admitted everything,

943
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,050
还提出了一个让他住口的和解方案
and offered him a settlement to keep quiet.

944
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,960
我们什么也没承认  而且那是保密协定
We didn't admit anything, and that settlement is sealed.

945
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,210
你说的是这份吗
Oh, you mean this settlement?

946
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,620
我们有约在先的
We had an agreement.

947
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,390
伊凡  拿钱息事宁人的坏处就在于
Well, here's the thing about paying people off, Evan.

948
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,470
总有人能出更高的价
Someone can always pay them more.

949
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,840
他的话没有理查德·麦金泰尔先生的可靠
His word won't hold up against Richard McIntyre's.

950
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,550
他不会说是理查德·麦金泰尔先生指使的
Oh, he's not saying that Richard McIntyre put him up to it.

951
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,940
他说是你干的
He's saying you did.

952
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,270
胡说八道
That's bullshit.

953
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,160
那真的重要吗
And does that really matter?

954
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,180
你想要什么
What do you want?

955
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,520
你让写报告的作者消失了
You made the author of that report disappear.

956
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,060
也让乔·亨德森消失了
You made Joe Henderson disappear.

957
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,360
想想办法让唐娜的目击者也
Figure out a way to make the witness against Donna

958
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,440
改个说辞
change her tune.

959
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,230
这是妨碍司法公正
That's obstruction of justice.

960
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,700
那是你的问题
That's not my problem.

961
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,740
你这个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

962
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,990
决定权在你
It's your call.

963
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,030
也许人们会相信乔  也许不会
Maybe people will believe Joe, maybe they won't,

964
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,380
但怎样你恐怕都不但赚不到钱
but instead of making money,

965
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,820
还得用接下来的五年辛苦地在庭上
you're gonna be defending yourself in court

966
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,320
为自己做辩护了
for the next five years.

967
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,480
既然确信是我们干的  你真的会选择
You're so sure we did this, you're really gonna let us

968
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,640
为了你的秘书让我们逃出法网吗
get away with murder for your secretary?

969
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,050
我正是要这么做  就算让我再选一百次
You're damn right I am, and if I had to do it again,

970
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,150
我也绝不会犹豫
I'd do it 100 times.

971
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,820
这是什么
What's that?

972
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,680
你知道这是什么
You know that it is.

973
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,510
-杰夫  -杰西卡  你说的对
- Jeff -- - Jessica, you were right.

974
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,170
要么两者兼得  要么两者皆失
We either need to have both, or it's not going to work.

975
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,370
但你不想兼得
And you don't want both?

976
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,760
此刻起  我提出辞职
Effective immediately, I'm tendering my resignation.

977
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,830
那我祝你好运
Then I wish you luck.

978
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,520
也祝你好运  杰西卡
Good luck, Jessica.

979
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,080
还记得吗
Do you remember?

980
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,100
当然记得  就是在那发生的
Yes, of course I remember. It happened right there.

981
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,230
那都是你的错
Well, it was your fault,

982
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,260
是你害我大笑的
'cause you made me burst out laughing.

983
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,400
可不光是大笑吧
You didn't just burst.

984
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,860
你喷出了一块虾肉都飞到屋子那头了
You spat a piece of shrimp across the room

985
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,900
就落在我妈妈的头发上
and into the back of my mother's hair.

986
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,870
但因为厚厚的发胶她甚至都没感觉到
And she didn't even feel it because of all the hair spray,

987
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,400
结果虾就跟标签似的一直挂在那里
and it stuck in there like a tick.

988
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,290
太搞笑了
Oh, my God.

989
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,920
接下来的两个小时我都没好意思
I could hardly look at her or that boyfriend

990
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,250
看她和她男朋友
for the next two hours.

991
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,260
他叫什么来着
What was his name again?

992
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,900
谁在乎  笨蛋一个
Who cares? He was such a loser.

993
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,410
拜托  他可是你参加了那个
Oh, come on; he was the reason you had

994
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,500
糟糕透顶的派对的原因呢
that god-awful party in the first place.

995
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,800
谢谢你  哈维
Thank you, Harvey.

996
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,840
不用道谢了  你不是都谢过我了吗
You don't need to thank me. You already thanked me.

997
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,980
不  上次道谢是谢谢你救我
No, I thanked you for fixing it.

998
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,090
这次是谢谢你一晚上都没提这事
Now I'm thanking you for not bringing it up all night.

999
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,700
我想如果你愿意谈
I just figured if you wanted it brought up,

1000
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,630
你会主动提  你看你这不是提起了吗
you'd bring it up, and now you have, so...

1001
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,810
我说过不会让你出事
I told you I'd never let anything happen to you,

1002
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,230
就绝对会遵守诺言
and I won't ever,

1003
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,260
所以以后你再也不用害怕成那个样子了
so you don't ever have to feel scared like that again.

1004
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,360
你不是说你不会安慰人吗
I thought you said you didn't do the comfort thing.

1005
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,860
我没说我不会
I didn't say I didn't do it.

1006
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,970
我说的是当时没时间
I said I didn't have time,

1007
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,630
因为我在忙着救你的小命
because I was so busy saving your ass.

1008
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,470
很抱歉质疑了你
I'm sorry I doubted you.

1009
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,540
我也很抱歉吼了你
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

1010
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,050
其他人对我失去信心
Anyone else every loses faith in me,

1011
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,380
我根本不在乎
it doesn't matter.

1012
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,000
但你不行
But with you, it's different.

1013
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,320
我该走了
I should go.

1014
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,020
为什么
Why?

1015
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,000
你知道原因
You know why.

1016
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,990
你知道我爱你  唐娜
You know I love you, Donna.
