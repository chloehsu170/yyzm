00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,240
而它会激励你  好吗
This will force you to, okay?

158
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,960
我还能做两周的导师  好好利用吧
Let's make the most of my two weeks left of mentoring.

159
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,700
旁听这次的取证  做点笔记
Take notes on this deposition.

160
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,600
我之后会问你  你认为我们应该
Afterwards, I'll ask you what you think

161
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,050
提出多少的和解费
we should offer as a settlement.

162
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,780
卢卡
Lucca.

163
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,560
洛哈特女士  你好
Ms. Lockhart. Hello.

164
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,820
我不知道你加入了雷迪克&博斯曼律所
I didn't know you joined Reddick & Boseman.

165
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,770
四个月前加入的
Four months ago.

166
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
艾丽西娅也在吗
Oh. Alicia, too?

167
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,860
不  只有我
No, just me.

168
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,390
恭喜你
Well, congratulations.

169
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,350
我们现在开始吗  还是
Shall we get started here, or do we...

170
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,260
戴安  抱歉我迟到了
Diane, sorry I'm late.

171
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,250
门罗法官在电梯里拦着我聊了会儿
Judge Monroe stopped me in the elevator.

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,010
大家还好吗
How is everyone?

173
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,810
戴安  真可惜
Daine, I feel so bad.

174
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,370
听说你要退休了
I heard you're retiring.

175
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,540
要输掉最后一个案子的感觉一定很糟
It's terrible you're gonna lose your last case.

176
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,650
博斯曼先生  你这话太出人意料了
Mr. Boseman, how unexpected.

177
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,350
我是哪边的人来着
So, which side am I on here?

178
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,340
点兵点将  大兵大将
Eeny...Meeny...

179
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,630
小兵小将
Miny...

180
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,590
好吧
Okay.

181
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,370
救命
Someone help!

182
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,940
放开他  放开他
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

183
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,180
-我很难受  -放开他
- Ow, I'm sick! - Leave him alone!

184
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,970
我很难受  让我起来
I'm sick! Let me up!

185
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,070
让我起来
Let me up...

186
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,730
这视频是你拍的对吧  亨特先生
You shot that video, didn't you, Mr. Hunter?

187
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,160
-是的  -能告诉我们你看见了什么吗
- Yes. - Would you tell us what you saw?

188
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,970
我看到这些警察把托比按在地上
I saw these cops tackling Toby.

189
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,080
你指托比·肯德尔先生  这位受害者吗
And that would be Mr. Toby Kendall, the victim right here?

190
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,210
-反对受害者一词  -真的吗  戴安
- Objection as to victim. - Really, Diane?

191
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,420
这位先生已经坐在轮椅上了
The gentleman's in a wheelchair.

192
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,370
吃饭都得靠他父母喂
His parents have to feed him.

193
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,160
你想让我叫他什么
Now what do you want me to call him, um...

194
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,580
快乐的涉事人吗
Happy participant?

195
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,130
我接受被捕人这个称呼
Arrestee is good by me.

196
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,720
不行  你可以将你的反对意见记录在案
No, you can preserve your objection for the record,

197
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,640
但那可不是一位被捕者的样子
but that right there is no arrestee.

198
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,920
住手  住手  快住手
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

199
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,960
住手
Stop!

200
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,170
对托比·肯德尔头部的一脚
That kick to Toby Kendall's head,

201
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,490
完全是毫无缘由的攻击  对吗
that was completely unprovoked, am I right?

202
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,260
是的
Yeah.

203
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,700
托比只是躺在那而已
Toby just lay there.

204
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,320
该你了  戴安
All yours, Diane.

205
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,410
你提到原告的时候总是叫他托比
You keep referring to the plaintiff as Toby.

206
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,430
你认识托比吗
Do you know Toby?

207
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,460
你们是朋友吗
Are you friends? 

208
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,950
我是不是该问博斯曼先生
Should I ask Mr. Boseman

209
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,100
-他是否想要回答这个问题  -反对
- if he wants to answer that question? - Objection.

210
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,640
好吧  我再问一遍
Okay, let me ask you again.

211
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,020
-你认识托比吗  -他是我的朋友
- Do you know toby? - He's a friend.

212
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,410
当晚你们是否合谋爆窃车辆
And were you together that night trying to break into cars?

213
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,510
我们没有爆窃任何东西
We didn't break into anything.

214
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,200
因为你们在得手前就被抓了
Because you were caught before you could...

215
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,350
反对  他已经回答过问题了
Objection. He's already answered the question.

216
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,770
阿德里安  你怎么不坐呀
Adrian, why don't you sit down?

217
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,320
因为我斗志昂扬
Because I'm too passionate.

218
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,520
好吧
Oh, okay.

219
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,370
亨特先生  这段视频
Uh, Mr. Hunter, this video.

220
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,150
阿德里安  麻烦倒回去一下
Adrian, would you mind rewinding?

221
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,500
-当然  -谢谢
- Sure. - Thanks.

222
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,830
请问这是
Is this...

223
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,840
录制的开始吗
the beginning of the recording here?

224
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,610
是的  你什么意思
Yeah, what-what do you mean?

225
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,870
你就是这时候打开摄像头的  这一刻
This is where you turned on your camera, right here?

226
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,870
用我手机  是的
My cell phone, yeah.

227
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,920
在这一刻之前没有其他镜头了吗
There was no other footage before this moment?

228
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,680
戴安  你要说什么
Diane, what do you have?

229
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,150
大家就别绕弯子了
Let's not sandbag here.

230
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,120
你知道你的视频是附带元数据的吗
Did you know that your video has metadata attached to it?

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,570
即使你试图删除视频  元数据仍然会显示
Even if you try to erase it, the metadata tells us

232
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,110
这段视频缺少了1分20秒
that there is one minute and 20 seconds missing

233
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,670
-就在片头的位置  -反对
- from the head of it. - Objection!

234
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,520
你觉得呢
Well?

235
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,330
400万
$4 million.

236
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,200
为什么
Why?

237
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,340
那段视频
The video.

238
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,510
很不利
It's bad.

239
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,800
客户要求我们把和解价格控制在50万以下
We've been asked to keep the settlement under $500,000.

240
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,850
-客户是  -库克县
- By... - Cook county.

241
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,570
他们前一任民事律所就因为大手大脚解雇了
They fired their last civil law firm for being profligate.

242
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,900
说曹操曹操到
Oh, here they come.

243
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,970
只要激进点就行
Just play the radical.

244
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,010
算了  我不擅长激进
Come on, I'm bad at it.

245
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,290
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

246
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,820
我都怕你
You scare me. 

247
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,190
这招对付戴安可不行
Not with Diane.

248
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,250
她能识破
She'll know. 

249
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,050
-你们是在抢纳税人的钱  -不  戴安
- You are robbing the taxpayers. - No, Diane, no,

250
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,430
你是在暗示所谓的丢失视频里
you're implying that this so-called missing video 

251
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,090
-含有违法的内容  -我只说了
- shows something nefarious. - I'm not saying anything

252
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,930
警方报告里所提及的内容
other than what the police report states.

253
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,060
得了  戴安  你不可能半步不让的
Come on, Diane, you know you got to give up something.

254
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,590
-14万  -少来这套
- $140,000. - Oh, come on.

255
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,510
库克县不想再受迫于这些法律诉讼
Cook county will no longer have a gun put to its head

256
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,410
-继而在重压之下妥协  -开玩笑  重压之下妥协
- with these lawsuits. - Seriously? Gun to its head?

257
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,220
像我们当事人被真枪指着头的时候
How nice to be able to talk in metaphors 

258
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,150
你用这种暗喻真是太好了
when people like our clients have a literal gun to their head.

259
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,280
戴安  我明白你想用你的强势给你的新客户
Look, Diane, I understand you want to impress your new client

260
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,450
留下好印象  但是客观来看
with your toughness, but look at the optics.

261
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,780
你们三名警察  三名白人警察
You got three cops-- three white cops--

262
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,390
一通乱踢一个手无寸铁的孩子
Kicking the crap out of this defenseless kid.

263
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,390
是的  可怜无辜的偷车贼
Yes, this poor, innocent car thief.

264
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,960
这就是你们的策略  责怪受害者
So that's your strategy? Blame the victim?

265
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,490
不  我们的策略是这样的
No, this is our strategy.

266
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,180
贵所通过这些警方暴力执法的案件
Your firm has personally enriched itself

267
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,810
为自身谋取利益高达
to the tune of $180 million

268
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,780
1亿8000万美元
with these police brutality cases.

269
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,240
你们就是在抢劫
You are robbing the tax dollars

270
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,850
这座城市最弱势的
coming from the city's most vulnerable

271
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,150
美国黑人社区的纳税钱
African-american communities...

272
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,780
戴安  你是什么时候变得如此愤世嫉俗的
Diane, when did you get so cynical?

273
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,210
你应该站在我们这一边  而不是
You should be on this side of the table, not... 

274
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,600
我们都是在利用这个案子  卢卡
We're both using this case, Lucca. 

275
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,070
你还是就事论事的好
Why don't you just stick to the facts?

276
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,370
好吧  这样吧
Okay, all right.

277
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,820
我们降到400万
We'll come down to $4 million,

278
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,730
不能再少了
but that's it.

279
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,450
那我就提到40万
And I'll go up to $400,000.

280
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,760
我们明天见吧  戴安
We'll see you tomorrow, Diane.

281
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,280
我能问一句吗
Can I ask something?

282
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,590
当然  问吧
Sure, go ahead.

283
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,800
这个案子  我们是站在正确的一方吗
Are we on the right side on this one?

284
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,260
我们站在必要的一方
We are on a necessary side.

285
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,860
我一度笃定有罪的人
People I thought with all my heart were guilty

286
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,450
结果却是无辜的
turned out to be innocent.

287
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,690
而我坚信是圣人的人
And people I thought were saints--

288
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,820
他们  他们反而不是
they, um, they weren't.

289
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,230
这就是为什么你不能相信直觉
That's why you don't go on instinct.

290
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,500
多等  多听
You wait, you listen

291
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,250
多观察
and watch.

292
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,630
最终  人人都会显露本色
Eventually, everyone reveals themself.

293
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,570
我们正在整合资源
Hey, we're pooling our resources.

294
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,290
要不要一起
You want to join?

295
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,320
不了  谢谢
No, it's all right. Thanks.

296
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,520
你去哪了
Where were you?

297
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,560
这些我才弄了三分之一
I'm only a third of the way through this.

298
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,580
一个合伙人给了我一个任务
A partner just gave me an assignment

299
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,970
而且我可以再拽一个律师来帮我
and I can pull another associate onto it.

300
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,420
你想做吗
You want to do it?

301
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,700
想啊
Yes!

302
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,430
等等  等一下
Wait, hey... Wait a second,

303
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,520
等一下  这只是摆摆姿态而已
Wait a second. It's a pose.

304
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,500
做个样子  他们开价会变高的
That's all. They will come up.

305
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,220
我们不想在这上面耗太多时间  阿德里安
We don't want to bury too much time in this, Adrian.

306
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,100
芭芭拉
Barbara, look,

307
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,690
库克县  他们想让我们妥协
Cook county, they're trying to break our backs on this thing.

308
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,320
我们妥协一次  下次他们就会以之要挟
We bend here, they use it against us on the next suit.

309
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,320
卢卡
Lucca?

310
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,280
你了解戴安  你觉得她会提高报价吗
You know Diane. Will she come up in her offer?

311
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,650
我认为戴安要证明自己
I think Diane's got something to prove

312
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,700
-而且她会努力做到  -所以呢

我也要证明自己

314
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,130
我们都要证明自己
We all have something to prove.

315
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,740
-她就要退休了  -是的
- She's retiring? - Yes.

316
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,500
她想赢下最后一战
She wants to go out with a win.

317
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,130
让她的报价提高到100万  然后处理别的案子吧
Let's get her up to a million, and move on to the next.

318
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,870
不  芭芭拉  我告诉你  她想要我们妥协  
No, barbara, she wants to cave. I'm telling you.

等你说服她把报价提高到100万再说
We'll talk when you get her to a million.

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,200
卢卡
Lucca,

321
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,150

00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,400
只是有人问了我个问题  只是如此
I was asked a question, that's all.

323
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,600
你觉得我不能赢过戴安
Yeah, you don't think I can take Diane down?

324
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,160
没有  我只是觉得我帮不上忙  这是干嘛
No, I just think I'm not helping. What is this?

325
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,980
找首席财务官肯德里克  带点口音
Ask for CFO kendrick, with the accent.

326
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,020
拜托
Oh, come on.

327
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,090
我在企业层面遇到了阻碍
I'm getting held up at the corporate level.

328
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,010
她会很高调的  打吧  帮帮我
She'll raise her tone. Come on, help me out.

329
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,140
博斯曼先生  我

330
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,250
喂  你好
Yes, hello.

331
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,930
阿德里安·博斯曼想要找肯德里克先生
Adrian Boseman calling for Mr. Kendrick.

332
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,290
如果可以的话  他也想亲自和他谈

333
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,430
可他刚出去吃午餐了

338
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,980
以优等生的成绩毕业于法律学院之后

339
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,590
戴安成为了一名地区检察官助理
Diane became an Assistant District Attorney.

340
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,460
她以不遗余力寻求真相
She made her reputation as someone

341
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,250
而广受赞誉
who fought hard for the truth,

342
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,170
五年之后
And after five years...

343
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,070
天呐  我有那么年轻过吗
Oh, my god, was I ever that young?

344
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,100
我简直不敢相信你就要离开我们了  戴安
I can't believe you're leaving us, Diane.

345
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,660
我精神上与你们同在
Oh, not in spirit.

346
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,460
如果你想要回来的话
If you ever think of coming back,

347
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,030
一定要先来我这儿
You don't go anywhere else first.

348
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,540
我答应你  蕾妮
I promise, Renee.

349
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,750
等一下
Wait a minute...

350

你答应过我的
You promised me.

351
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,400
你好  伊森
Oh, Ethan.

352
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,760
我们是伙伴  我的大门永远为你敞开
We have partners I'd throw out the door to make room for you.

353
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,260
被需要的感觉真好

354
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,460
谢谢你的到来

玛娅告诉我们你是一位良师
Maia tells us what a great mentor you are.

359
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,240
她是个好孩子  我爱她
Oh, she's such a doll. I love her.

360
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,730
顺便说一下  格伦一直想要找你
By the way, uh, Glenn's been trying to reach you.

361
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,610
在普罗旺斯的房子这事上我们没有时间了
We're running out of time on the Provence house.

362
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,200
我的天哪
Oh, my god,

363
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,380
我真是好嫉妒  普罗旺斯啊
I am so jealous. Provence!

364
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,950
是啊  但我要先给首付才行

365
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,430
是的  我想把事情都处理妥当
Well, yes, I wanted to get my ducks in a row first.

366
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,090
你的投资项目回报很高  戴安
You know, your investments are working so well for you, Diane,

367
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,210
我提议一个更明智的选择  首付去借贷
I was wondering if it's not smarter to borrow the money,

368
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,450
你的钱还是存在基金里
and leave it in the fund.

369
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,020
好的  那我和格伦再谈谈吧
Oh, well, let me discuss it with Glenn.

370
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,440
但是你可以给他打电话啊  他并不坏
But, um, do give him a call, he's not a bad guy,

371
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,600
而且他感觉自己被忽视了
and he's feeling a bit ignored.

372
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,450
是啊  会计师本来就倾向于觉得被忽视
Yeah, accountants tend to feel ignored.

373
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,420
-你好啊  亲爱的  -他们来了

374

你们俩什么时候才结婚

妈  别这样
Mom, no!

378
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,390
为什么  最高法院的借口已经行不通了
Why? There's no supreme court excuse anymore.

379
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,940
你和你叔叔谈了吗
Have you talked to your uncle?

380
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,060
谁啊  贾克斯吗  没有
Who, Jax? Mm. No. 

381
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,590
他没和你说基金的事吗
He didn't talk to you about the fund?

382
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,750
没有  怎么了
No, why?

383
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,930
没事  只是你们两个太亲近了
Nothing, just you two are so close.

384

如果他给你打电话  让你和别人谈话

385
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,330
先给我打个电话  好吗
call me first, okay?

386
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,040
发生什么事了  爸爸

389
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,050

-我的随身摄像机  -型号是IP68

三年前起  所有库克县警官都会佩戴
It was given to all Cook County officers 3 years ago,

402
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,880
为了预防警官吃官司  比如这个案子
in order to prevent law suit exactly like this one.

403
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,470
你是提问还是在陈述事实
Is there a question here or it's just a statement?

404
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,540
泰鲁警官

怎么了

你看见他们身后的那辆车了吗

我爸妈也有一辆一模一样的
My parents own one just like it.

413
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,410
这不是他们爆窃的车

414
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,850
我知道  但你看到边灯是亮着的吗
I know, but, uh, well, do you see the perimeter light on?

如果有人与车发生碰撞它就会亮

它们会自动录像并存在硬盘中

你是说如果我们联系到那辆车的车主

就在硬盘上  它们没法被清除掉
It's on its hard drive. They can't erase it.

431

女士  请不要打电话

他肯定磕了药  否则不可能...
He was definetly hopped-up on something. There's no way...

447

00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,320
他说这事很重要
He says it's important.

453
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,530
我们培训过如何分辨
...are trained to recognize.

454
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,890
我们看见了他的行为...
When we saw how he was acting...

455
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,350
爸
Dad!

456
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,990
天啊
Oh, my god.

457
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,060
去看看你妈  没事的
Go see your mom. It's okay.

458
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,140
-爸  -亲爱的  听我说

459
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,890
一切都会没事的  我保证
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise.

460
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,810
我知道
I know.

461
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,650
我爱你  我没有干  玛娅
I love you. I didn't do it, Maia.

462
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,910
我知道  我知道
I know, I know!

463
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,070
格伦  发生什么了  是房子的事吗 
Glenn, what's going on? Is it the house?

464
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,950
没有  怎么了
No, what?

465
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,350
什么时候
When?

466
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,470
我不理解  我刚才...
I don't understand, I just...

467
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,510
很多金融人士在问
Many on Wall Street are asking,

468
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:56,080
{\an8}亿万富翁投资商亨利·林德尔被捕

469
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,970
亨利·林德尔是新麦道夫吗
Is Henry Rindell the new Madoff?

470
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,450
{\an8}麦道夫：美国史上最大的诈骗案"庞氏骗局"的制造者

471
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,880
今日早些时候  联调局关闭了
Earlier today, the FBI shuttered

472
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,930
这个只有受邀才能加入的投资基金
the invitation-only investment fund,

473
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,730
称其为涉及数十亿美元的庞氏骗局
calling it a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme,

474
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,490
该基金的倒闭会使我国
whose collapse has decimated the accounts

475
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,190
许多自由派精英的账户大幅缩水
of many of the nation's liberal elites.

476
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,330
格伦  那我的...
Glenn, what about my...

477
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,470
我的退休金呢
my retirement money?

478
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,470
从200万到500万美元
...range from $2 to $5 million.

479
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,400
妈的
Fuck!

480
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,290
傲骨之战
第一季  第一集

481
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,660
这使得这次行动看起来有利且合法
This makes the operation seem profitable and legitimate

482
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,900
虽然并不是实体上的盈利
even though no actual profit is being made.

483
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,210
-你有一直在健身  -是啊
- You've been working out. - Yeah.

484
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,620
和其他人一起
With someone not me.

485
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,800
你很忙
You were busy.

486
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,380
涉及83亿资产
...with $8.3 billion in assets, 

487
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,650
这将是美国历史上第四大庞氏骗局
it'll be the fourth largest Ponzi scheme in America...

488
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,760
我认识她
I know her.

489
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,350
谁  她吗
Who, her?

490
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,620
希望你的钱没有被卷进去
I hope you didn't have any money wrapped up with them. 

491
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,780
我姑妈的有
My aunt did.

492
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,020
天啊  现在她可难做人了
God, I'd sure hate to be her right now.

493
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,440
说到美国人最恨的人
Talk about the most hated person in America.

494
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,850
庞氏骗局是由一名中心操盘手操控
...Ponzi schemes are run by a central operator,

495
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,350
他利用新投资者投进来的钱
who uses the money from new incoming investors 

496
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,040
去支付给给上一批投资人作为承诺的回报
to pay off the promised returns to older ones...

497
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,030
一想到这个投资基金的邀请我就不寒而栗
Shuddered at the invitation of the investment fund, 

498
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,810
这个数十亿美元的庞氏骗局...
calling it a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme...

499
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,710
丽诺
Lenore?

500
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,830
鲁珀特  
Rupert?

501
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,090
你见过他了吗
Did you see him?

502
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,570
见过了
Yes, yes, yes.

503
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,590
亨利没事
Henry is fine.

504
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,500
太好了  太好了
Good, good.

505
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,490
玛娅  艾米  幸好你俩都在
Hey, Maia, Amy. I'm glad you're both here.

506
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,440
怎么回事
What's going on?

507
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,700
你的父亲需要你的帮助
Your dad needs your help.

508
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,100
你叔叔贾克斯刚和联调局的人达成协议
Your uncle Jax made a deal with the Feds.

509
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,770
天哪  他太可怕了  他说了什么
Oh, my god, he's a monster. What's he saying?

510
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,970
说亨利制造了这起庞氏骗局
That Henry created the ponzi scheme.

511
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,590
贾克斯声称自己与其毫无瓜葛
Jax claims he had nothing to do it with it.

512
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,250
只不过是亨利骗局的遮羞布
He was just a fig leaf for Henry's scam.

513
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,680
荒谬至极  那怎么可能
That is insane. That doesn't even make sense.

514
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,300
明明贾克斯负责股票买卖
Jax traded stocks.

515
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,810
我们只不过是为他宣传
We were just the ambassadors.

516
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,580
所以当务之急就是
That's why it's important that we all agree

517
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,240
我们达成共识
on our understanding here.

518
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,640
先从你俩开始...  玛娅
Starting with you two... Maia?

519
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:48,960
玛娅
Maia?

520
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,250
-在  -我们需要你的帮助
- Yeah. - We need your help.

521
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,830
你也是基金会董事会的成员吗
You were on the board of the foundation?

522
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,210
天哪  他是说基金会也牵扯其中吗
Oh, my God, is he saying that the foundation is part of this?

523
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,520
不  他说之前为了躲避审查
No. He's saying the money was parked there

524
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,250
才把钱暂时放在那儿
to hide it during audits.

525
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,410
所以玛娅  需要所有成员签字才能将钱转移
So, Maia, there are signatures on each one of the money transfers.

526
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,630
你得看一下文件
I need you to take a look at them.

527
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,990
我们该走了
Actually, we should go.

528
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,040
什么  不行  为什么
What? No, no. Why?

529
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,970
我们不该牵扯进来  走吧
We shouldn't be here for this. Let's go.

530
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:08,470
什么意思
What are you talking about?

531
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,550
我只是让玛娅在文件上签字罢了
I just need Maia to initial these documents.

532
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,380
鲁珀特  你是亨利和丽诺的律师
Rupert. You're Henry and Lenore's lawyer,

533
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,410
不是玛娅的
not Maia's.

534
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,600
-我是他们的家庭律师  -不是
- Well, I'm the family lawyer. - That's not true.

535
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
你和他争什么
Why are you arguing with him?

536
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,300
事实如此  玛娅
It is true. Maia.

537
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,700
你爸需要你的帮助
Dad needs your help.

538
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,770
他正麻烦缠身
Dad's in trouble.

539
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,790
玛娅  在这些文件上签字吧
Maia, just look at these documents.

540
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,050
鲁伯特  你我有律师与当事人的保密协定吗
Rupert, do we have attorney-client privilege?

541
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,110
没有  但我们受我与你母亲的保密协议保护
Well, no, but we're covered by your mom's privilege.

542
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,190
你我有律师与当事人的保密协定吗
Do we have attorney-client privilege?

543
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,490
没有  但是...
N-no, but...

544
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,950
那你就不是我的律师
You're not my lawyer, then.

545
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,830
妈  我爱你
Mom, I love you.

546
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,220
-不是你爸做的  -我知道  我知道
- Dad didn't do this. - I know. I know.

547
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,570
这会要他的命
This will kill him.

548
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,300
我们不答应
We won't let it.

549
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,380
天哪  知道这意味着什么吗
God, what does this mean? Um...

550
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,560
意味着我基本失去了半辈子的积蓄
It means I basically lost half my life.

551
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,190
我无法退休
I don't have a retirement.

552
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,110
我和妻子必须工作到死
My wife and I will have to work until we drop dead.

553
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,090
他们都该进监狱  每一个人
They should go to jail, every single one of 'em.

554
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,210
就连他们的女儿也是  她肯定知情
Even the daughter. She had to know, too.

555
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,110
我白白工作了二十年
I-I just worked 20 years for no reason.

556
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,630
我和丈夫会失去我们的房子
My husband and I will lose our house,

557
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,430
车子  所有一切
our cars, everything.

558
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,600
我们的孩子也将一无所有
Our kids will have nothing.

559
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,240
我们失去了奋斗得来的一切  几乎所有人
We've lost everything that we've worked for. Almost everyone...

560
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,320
要说出来太难了
That was hard.

561
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,340
你做得很好
You did good.

562
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,880
这是噩梦
It's a nightmare.

563
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,530
你需要一个律师
You're gonna need a lawyer.

564
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,600
戴安
Diane?

565
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,560
怎么了
Yes?

566
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,810
你在听我说吗
Are you hearing this?

567
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,380
全都没了
It's all gone?

568
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,000
林德尔家族现在手头只有1380万
Well, the Rindells have $13.8 million on hand,

569
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,880
而初始投资金有80亿
and that's from an initial investment of $8 billion.

570
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,280
他们一分钱都没投资吗
They never invested a cent?

571
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,520
2008年之后就没有了
Not after 2008.

572
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,270
房地产泡沫曾使资金出现短缺
The housing bubble. There was a shortfall,

573
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,370
他们用新投资者的钱填补了空缺
and they made it up with money from new investors.

574
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,180
我还介绍了客户给他们
But I steered people to them.

575
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,930
女性基金会  她们所有的钱
The women's fund, all their money.

576
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,020
我甚至让艾米丽的客户把养老金都了投进去
I even told Emily's list to put their 401k there.

577
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,560
我知道你有很多伤脑筋的事  戴安
I know there's a lot for you to process, Diane,

578
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,820
但有些事我们得先考虑
but we need to think about a few things

579
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,220
并且动作要快
and act fast.

580
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,730
-第三方托管的事吗  -没错
- The escrow? - Yes.

581
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,930
尽管会有惩罚
There will be a penalty,

582
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,740
但我们必须马上抽身
but we must get out of it now.

583
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,350
{\an8}光之墅

584
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,960
的确
Yes.

585
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,540
很好
Good.

586
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,990
你还需要推迟退休
And you need to delay your retirement.

587
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,600
政府可能冻结你的账户
The government might freeze your account

588
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,210
把你列入最低生活工资名单
and put you on a living-wage budget.

589
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,190
什么  为什么
What? Why?

590
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,550
他们要设法将过去的收益追回
Well, they can claw back past earnings

591
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,540
再分配给所有的受害者
and distribute them among all the victims.

592
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,640
麦道夫事件时他们就是这么处理的
That's what they did with Madoff.

593
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,840
可我的个人账户  那是我自己的钱啊
But my personal account-- that is my money, isn't it?

594
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,380
不一定
No, not necessarily.

595
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,130
他们会允许你保留
They'll allow you to keep

596
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,290
能维持最低生活水平的现金
a subsistence-level amount of cash,

597
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,230
但可能会冻结剩余的
but they might freeze the rest.

598
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,650
所以我破产了吗
So am I broke?

599
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,200
我不太喜欢这个说法
Well, I don't like to talk that way,

600
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,050
但你一直以来享有的生活
but you can't live the way you've been living

601
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,590
持续不了几个月了
for more than a few months.

602
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,110
你得保住你的工作
You'll need to keep your job.

603
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,260
或者把你的公寓转租出去
Or maybe sublet this apartment.

604
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,270
你和你丈夫还没办离婚
Is there a reason you and your husband

605
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,850
是有什么原因吗
are delaying your divorce?

606
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,310
什么
What?

607
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,860
你和你丈夫不是分居了吗
You and your husband are separated, right?

608
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,560
-没错  -如果是永久分居
- Yes.  - Well, if your separation is permanent,

609
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,670
你们就应该认真考虑一下
then you really should consider

610
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,090
是否该完成离婚手续了
memorializing with the divorce,

611
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,450
不然他的账户也有可能被冻结
otherwise, his accounts could be frozen, too.

612
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,590
这真是太可怕了
This is a nightmare.

613
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,670
再说一遍  你得先下手为强
Again, you need to act first.

614
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,430
你要做的第一件事就是延后你的退休计划
And the first thing is to delay your retirement.

615
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,320
这不单是因为我的财政状况
This is not just about my financial situation.

616
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,210
也因为我怕自己会想念当律师的日子
I'm also afraid I would miss practicing the law.

617
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,790
我当时正在给肯德尔案取证
I was in the midst of the Kendall deposition,

618
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,900
心里突然想  天哪
And I thought, uh, my god,

619
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,120
我爱这一行  我就是干这一行的
I love this-- this is what I do.

620
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,170
所以你有什么提议
So what do you propose?

621
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,460
我不退休了  等结案之后
That I not leave. That I close the case,

622
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,170
我继续留在这里
and, um, that I stay on.

623
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,750
什么职位
In what position?

624
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,040
这个职位  我现在的职位
This position. My-my current position.

625
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,900
你已经签了离职协议了
You signed your exit agreement.

626
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,120
是的  但我们可以先不理那一点书面协议
Well, yes, but I would suggest we rip that up for the moment.

627
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,410
只可惜  我们应该没法接受
Unfortunately, I don't think that works for us.

628
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,330
为什么
Why not?

629
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,180
如你所说  我们的管理层有点太臃肿了
Well, we're kind of top-heavy, like you said.

630
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,240
我们已经根据你的离职重新做出调整
We already reorganized around your leaving.

631
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,100
这是我的律所啊
This is my firm.

632
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,590
不  这曾是你的律所
No, it was your firm.

633
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,720
是这样的  如果你想退休后保留职称
Look, if you want to stay on as an emeritus,

634
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,870
我们可以好好商量
we can discuss that.

635
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,210
然后放弃我的股权吗
And lose my equity?

636
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,840
你们不怕我带着客户离开这里吗
What is to keep me from taking my clients out the door with me?

637
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,030
你能把客人带到哪里去
Where would you take them?

638
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,890
我刚帮你们签下库克县这个一年3200万的大客户
I just brought Cook County and their 32 million a year to you.

639
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,920
等客户走了  我看你们有什么反应
Let's see how you feel when you lose them.

640
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,030
你就是那个女人  对不对
You are her, aren't you?

641
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,110
不是
No.

642
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,530
你是林德尔家族的
You're a Rindell.

643
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,630
你们害得我的退休金全没了
I lost my retirement because of you.

644
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,420
抱歉  我要...
Excuse me, I have to...

645
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,140
我知道你在哪里上班  蠢婊子
I know where you work, you stupid bitch!

646
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,360
你以为这事结束了吗
You think this is over?

647
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,010
-林德尔女士  -我和那件事无关...
- Ms. Rindell.  - I have nothing to do with...

648
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,220
不  我叫耶什·曼奇尼
No, I'm Yesha Mancini.

649
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,520
我是你的律师
I'm your lawyer.

650
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,650
你好  这里是洛哈特&德克尔...
Good morning, Lockhart, Deckler...

651
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,890
你多大了
How old are you?

652
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,960
这很重要吗
Does that matter?

653
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,280
有时挺重要的
It can.

654
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,600
Twenty-five.

655
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,020
-你当多久律师了  -6个月
- And you've been a lawyer for?  - Six months.

656
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,040
比我多3个月
Three months longer than me.

657
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,670
你联系了我们律所  说想雇一名律师
Uh, you contacted my firm asking for a lawyer.

658
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,430
不  那是我女友打的电话
No, my girlfriend did.

659
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,740
你女朋友想在我们律所请一名律师
Your girlfriend contacted my firm asking for a lawyer.

660
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,690
大家都很忙  所以...
Everyone else was busy, so...

661
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,580
我来了
tag...I'm it.

662
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,230
我想我们该谈一些...
I think we need to talk about a few things...

663
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,630
我得回去上班了
I got to get back.

664
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,340
等联调局找你去录口供的时候
Uh, when the Feds call you in for an interview...

665
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,800
他们肯定会的  记得打给我
and they will...call me.

666
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,330
这是我的名片
Here's my card.

667
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,250
其实这是我们律所的名片
Actually, it's my firm's card.

668
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,880
我把我老板的名字换成我的了
I just scratched out my boss' name. That's mine right there.

669
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,790
{\an8}阿姆斯特朗&海耶斯&拉加德律所
耶什·曼奇尼律师

670
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,080
这可没给我多少信心啊
Doesn't really instill confidence.

671
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,720
下次会给你我自己的名片
I'll have cards made up for next time.

672
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,090
我仔细考虑了你之前在派对上说的话
So, um, I was thinking about what you said at the party.

673
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,210
你说为了给我腾出位子
That you would have partners

674
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,690
会踢走一部分合伙人
thrown out the door to make room for me.

675
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,380
你是想当荣誉合伙人吗
Now, you're looking for an emeritus position?

676
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,540
不  是合伙人
Uh, no, a partnership.

677
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,760
我是说  我没...
I mean, I'm not...

678
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,350
想着让律所门口挂着我的名字  但...
looking for my name on the door, but...

679
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,040
我还是先和合伙人商量看看吧
Well, let me talk to my partners.

680
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,870
我仔细想了想你那天在我的派对上说的话
So I was thinking about what you said at my party,

681
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,740
我突然想到  为什么不继续当律师呢
And I realized-- why am I leaving the law?

682
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,510
我们还没打破天花板效应呢
We're not done breaking the glass ceiling.

683
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,510
{\an8}女性晋升高管的隐形屏障

684
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,970
-你不退休了吗  -不退了
- You're not retiring? - No.

685
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,450
但我确实要离开现在的律所了
But I am leaving my old firm.

686
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,380
我希望能加入你们
I was, um, hoping to join you.

687
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,440
发生什么了  蕾妮
What's going on, Renee?

688
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,460
什么意思
What do you mean?

689
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,950
我今天都和三家律所谈过了
I've been to three firms today.

690
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,080
要是在一个月前  他们早就高兴坏了
A month ago, they would've been climbing all over themselves.

691
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,770
现在时机不是很好  戴安
Uh... It's a tough time, Diane.

692
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,580
不是那样的  你在瞎说屁话
No, it's not. That's bullshit.

693
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,300
你说话能文明点吗
Do you want a civil conversation?

694
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,780
我希望朋友间说话能坦诚点
I want an honest conversation with a friend.

695
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,340
戴安  你也老大不小了
Diane, you're not a spring chicken.

696
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,650
所以因为我年纪大了  那么多客户都不要了
Oh, so it's ageism, with my book of clients?

697
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,200
那你就联系他们  戴安
Call them, Diane.

698
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,410
看看有多少客户肯跟你走
How many will actually go with you?

699
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,630
看看有多少人因为林德尔一家亏了钱
How many lost money with the Rindells?

700
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,050
又不是我骗了他们的钱
I'm not the Rindells.

701
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,530
是你把他们介绍给大家的
You referred them to people.

702
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,600
芝加哥女性基金会
The Chicago Women's Fund?

703
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
亏了整整8200万
It's out $82 million.

704
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,160
他们也许得关门大吉了
They may have to close their doors.

705
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,970
就给自己点时间吧
Just give it some time.

706
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,060
现在时机不对  你当下就好比毒药
It's a bad time right now. You're poison.

707
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,740
没有律所会雇佣你的
No firm will hire you.

708
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,650
就让这件事慢慢过去吧
Just let it pass.

709
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,220
你想要离婚吗
You want a divorce?

710
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,100
你的会计给我打过电话了
Your accountant called.

711
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,300
不离婚的话  库尔特
Without a divorce, Kurt, 

712
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,120
你的财产将会受到同样的
your finances will suffer from the same, uh...

713
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,960
同样的
from the same...

714
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,020
处置
thing.

715
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,650
这事关财产  和我俩无关
It's about money, not about us.

716
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,920
你希望怎样
What do you want?

717
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,590
不  这事
No, this is...

718
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,500
这事决定权在你
this is in your lap.

719
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,070
我并没有离开你
I didn't leave you.

720
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,230
实际上  你就是这么做了
Actually, you did.

721
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,920
你睡了你的学生  所以
You slept with your student, so...

722
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,010
好了  我的会计说
Okay, my accountant said that

723
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,990
我的银行账户会被冻结
my bank account will be frozen.

724
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,130
离婚会让你的账户免受牵连
A divorce will, uh, save your account

725
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,110
也算是签字确认我们当前的生活状态
and just memorialize what we're doing now.

726
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,850
什么状态
Which is?

727
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,120
分居
Living apart.

728
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,920
你还好吗
How are you?

729
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,870
我好极了
I'm great.

730
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,430
我现在破产而且失业
I'm broke and out of a job,

731
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,910
但是
But, hey...

732
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,030
不幸的事情就是会发生在好人身上
bad things happen to good people.

733
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,450
你失业了
You're out of a job?

734
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,790
是的  我已经签了离职协议  而他们
Yes, I signed my exit agreement, and they...

735
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,040
他们不愿
...they won't...

736
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,270
上帝啊
Oh, my god.

737
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,300
这就是我的生活  而现在
This is my life, and it's...

738
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,730
全完了
it's over.

739
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,990
什么都没了
It's gone.

740
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,580
我将要失去我的公寓
I'm losing my apartment.

741
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,020
我不宜被雇佣  这怎么可能
I'm unemployable. How is that possible?

742
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,500
我的生活怎么就他妈一下子变得如此毫无意义
How is my life suddenly so fucking meaningless?!

743
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,750
不是这样的
It isn't.

744
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,170
一个人是怎样每一天都努力辛勤工作
How can you work so hard every single day of your life

745
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,960
到头来却没有任何东西去证明价值
and have nothing to show for it?

746
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,310
甚至连一个朋友都没有
Not a friend!

747
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,600
我就是你朋友啊
I'm a friend.

748
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,830
库尔特
Kurt?

749
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,720
我已经感觉够糟糕了
I feel bad enough already.

750
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,310
我不想再承担
I don't want to be responsible

751
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,760
让你破产的责任了
for your going broke.

752
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,360
和我离婚吧
Divorce me.

753
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,510
早上好
Good morning,

754
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,750
这里是洛哈特&德克尔&古斯曼&李&莱曼&
Lockhart, Deckler, Gussman, Lee, Lyman,

755
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,350
吉尔伯特&卢瑞&卡根&坦纳鲍姆律所
Gilbert-Lurie, Kagan, Tannebaum & Associates.

756
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,330
戴安  我真的很抱歉
Diane. I am so sorry.

757
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,960
你还好吗
Are you okay?

758
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,460
那要看情况了  我能拿回我的钱吗
That depends-- will I get my money back?

759
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,400
抱歉  我的律师叫我
I'm sorry, my lawyer's directed me

760
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,910
不要回答这个问题
not to answer that.

761
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,300
那就别问我
Then don't ask me.

762
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,600
我们现在或许找到了一个小突破口
We may have a little opening right here.

763
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,960
去直击要害吧
Go for the jugular.

764
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,000
肯德尔先生  告诉我们一下你想偷
Mr. Kendall, tell us which car in the parking lot

765
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,850
-停车场里的哪辆车  -反对
- you were hoping to steal. - Objection.

766
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,630
这是个完全合理的问题
It is a completely fair question.

767
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,010
假设不在证据中的事实  完全没有证据支持
Not in evidence. Not close to being in evidence.

768
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,090
能让我把问题问完吗
Can I ask my question, please?

769
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,170
当然  我只是把我的反对意见记录在案
Sure, I'm just preserving my objection for the record.

770
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,660
是哪辆车  肯德尔先生
Which car was it, Mr. Kendall?

771
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,510
是图中那辆跑车吗
Was it the sports car here?

772
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,760
就是警察们发现车窗被砸破的那辆车
That's the one they found with the window broken.

773
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,770
我不  我不知道
Uh, I don't-I don't know.

774
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,690
我记不得了
I-I don't remember. 

775
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,480
你不记得你当时是要偷哪辆车吗
You don't remember which car you were there to steal? 

776
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,250
拜托  戴安
Come on, Diane,

777
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,360
这就是你仅有的本事了吗
Is this what you're left with--

778
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,870
纠缠一个坐轮椅的人
badgering someone in a wheelchair? 

779
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,130
抱歉
Excuse me,

780
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,820
对纠缠证人这一说法提出反对
Objection as to badgering.

781
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,370
我知道你现在生活很不如意
I understand you're not happy with your life,

782
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,340
但别把火撒在我们当事人身上
But don't take it out on our client.

783
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,110
好吧  今天到此为止
Okay, we're done here.

784
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,700
你在这啊
There you are.

785
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,300
我想让这整个律所知道是她偷走了我的钱财
I want this firm to know she stole my money.

786
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,440
我的孩子们不能去上大学了
My kids are not going to college

787
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,890
就因为她偷走了我的积蓄
because she stole my savings.

788
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,920
你是难逃法网的  我要为了我失去的每一分
You can't get away! I'm gonna sue you

789
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,140
血汗钱起诉你
for every single cent!

790
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,540
那就去起诉啊
Then do it!

791
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,430
不过现在  给我滚
But right now, fuck off!

792
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,130
当他们看到你哭泣
When they see you cry,

793
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,110
就会让他们很开心
it makes them happy.

794
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,970
所以在这里把委屈都发泄出来
So get it out of your system here.

795
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,060
你是对方律师
You're on the other side.

796
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,430
我曾有个朋友
I had a friend.

797
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,820
经历了同样的遭遇
Went through the same thing.

798
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,140
说过了几个月地狱般的生活
Said it was hell for a few months.

799
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,760
坚强起来
Harden yourself.

800
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,650
不要理会别人怎么说
Ignore what people say.

801
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,150
埋头好好工作
Keep your head down and keep working.

802
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,020
你是刚入行的律师对吗
You're a new associate?

803
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,570
工作是你的好朋友
Work is your friend.

804
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,410
不要看电视  不要上网
Don't watch TV, don't look at the internet.

805
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,870
看书吗
Do you have a book?

806
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,290
那就看书
Then read it.

807
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,280
随身带着
Keep it with you at all times.

808
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,340
不要有眼神交流
Don't give them the satisfaction

809
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,270
满足他们的猎奇心
of making eye contact.

810
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,390
是很难
It's hard.

811
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,360
但总会过去
But it ends.

812
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,050
这是录像视频  洛哈特女士
That's the video, Mrs. Lockhart.

813
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,240
说什么
Excuse me?

814
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,130
汽车上的录像视频  你要找的
The car video. The one you asked for.

815
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,630
对了
Oh, right.

816
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,140
博斯曼先生来见你
Oh, and, uh, Mr. Boseman is here to see you.

817
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,010
他...什么
He... what?

818
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,060
我们有约吗
Did we have a negotiation?

819
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,430
没有
No.

820
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,880
好  给我点时间
Okay, give me a minute.

821
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,890
阿德里安
Adrian.

822
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,880
我不记得我们有约
I didn't know we had a meeting.

823
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,120
不  没有
No, no, we didn't.

824
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,600
也不算正式会议
Uh, we're not.

825
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,780
我是来聊天的
I'm here to chat.

826
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,130
你还好吗  戴安
How you doing, Diane?

827
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,830
拜托  表同情这种事不像你  阿德里安
Come on, sympathy doesn't suit you, Adrian.

828
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,000
有何需要
What do you need?

829
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,360
你
You.

830
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,270
我
Me?

831
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,750
我
I... 

832
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,560
想要你加入我们律所
want you to join our firm.

833
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,050
你破产了  戴安
You're broke, Diane.

834
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,500
正在找新东家
You're looking for a place to land...

835
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,010
然而因为林德尔丑闻
And nobody wants you

836
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,870
没人想要你
'cause of this Rindell scandal.

837
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,660
我累了  阿德里安  我想回家
I'm tired, Adrian. I want to go home.

838
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,520
我们律所正在扩张
You know, we're in the midst of expanding.

839
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,030
你可以算是满足员工多元化的聘用
You could be... our diversity hire.

840
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,860
如果你是说这件案子
Well, if this is about the case,

841
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,900
并不能改变什么
it doesn't make any difference.

842
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,240
即使我加入你  我知道什么也不能说
I mean, even if I joined you, I can't use what I know.

843
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,770
跟这件案子无关
It's not about this case.

844
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,950
重要的是下一个  再下一个
It's about the next one and the next one

845
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,590
再下一个案子
and the next one and the next one.

846
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,450
戴安
Diane...

847
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,600
我们不想你打败我们
We don't want you to beat us.

848
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,700
我更想让你帮我们打败他们
I would much rather you help us beat them.

849
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,990
我会以合伙人的身份加入
I'd be a partner?

850
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,710
是  且你将再次支持正义
Yes, and you'd be back on the right side of things.

851
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,240
你怎么不怕林德尔丑闻
Why aren't you afraid of the Rindell scandal?

852
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,650
我有毒  你没听说吗
I'm poison. Haven't you heard?

853
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,570
主要的是  戴安
Yeah, here's the thing, Diane.

854
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,460
林德尔家族的投资基金
The Rindells ran an...

855
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,590
只邀请特定人群的加入
invitation-only investment fund, and you know what?

856
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,020
他们从没邀请过黑人
They never invited black folk.

857
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,490
你被耍了  戴安
You got fucked here, Diane.

858
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,090
最好的回应是什么
And you know the best response?

859
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,340
跟我走  反操他们一着
You come with me, and you fuck 'em back.

860
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,200
-给我解释一下  -好
- Explain it to me... - Okay.

861
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,930
-你干了什么  -我干了...
- What did you do? - I... What did I...

862
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,900
我这是改变策略  这叫策略  芭芭拉
I called an audible. It was an audible, Barbara. Ugh.

863
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,620
装得真事儿似的
Don't act like that's a thing here.

864
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,700
-你不商量就做了决定  -不
- You made a decision by Fiat. - Mm-mm, no.

865
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,130
-毫不在乎其他合伙人的想法  -不
- You didn't care what the rest of the partners thought. - No!

866
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,670
我看到了机会
I saw an opportunity.

867
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,460
-我认为这个机会...  -什么机会
- And I thought it was an opportunity that... - What opportunity?

868
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,380
-我们都会感激  -什么机会
- ...we would all appreciate. - What opportunity?

869
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,150
从此以后每次警察施暴案
Diane Lockhart's firm will be representing Cook county

870
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,620
戴安·洛哈特的律所都将代表
on every single one of their police brutality cases

871
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,680
库克县
from here until eternity!

872
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,150
现在至少
Now, at the very least,

873
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,960
我们挖走他们最强的律师
we just stole away their strongest attorney.

874
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,320
她可以帮我们制定策略
At the most, she helps us with strategy.

875
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,940
她什么都不能透露
She can't tell us anything.

876
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,280
这件案子不能透露
Not on this case she can't,

877
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,160
但以后的其它案子就可以了
but on every other case going forward she can.

878
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,030
芭芭拉
Barbara,

879
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,900
你担心失去我们的律所文化吗
are you worried about losing the firm's culture or something?

880
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,940
如果这是你担心的
If that's what you're worried about

881
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,620
-可以确保...  -阿德里安  打住
- ...we can make sure... - Adrian, stop.

882
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,860
你想知道我的担心吗
You want to know what I'm worried about?

883
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,020
-是的  -我听到的流言
- Yeah, yes, I do. - Every rumor I hear...

884
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,760
都说洛哈特不守本分
about Lockhart is that she doesn't know her place.

885
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,780
如果她不打入律所内部  就不会甘心
She's not gonna be happy until she's in the inner circle.

886
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,560
这是在说你自己  芭芭拉
You're describing yourself, Barbara.

887
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,390
这也是在说我
You're describing me.

888
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,620
我们有野心  需要这种人的加入
We're ambitious people, and we need people like that...

889
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,060
-律所才能扩张  -卢卡
- ...around to grow this company. - Lucca.

890
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,700
没错  但我们不需要
Yes, but we don't want people who are only happy

891
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,460
只想下命令的人
when they're giving orders.

892
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,800
卢卡  你与戴安·洛哈特共事过
Lucca, you worked with Diane Lockhart.

893
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:53,800
是的  共事一年
Yeah, for a year.

894
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,980
这么问毫无益处  芭芭拉
This is not helpful, Barbara.

895
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,460
你喜欢与她共事吗
Did you like working with her?

896
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,560
那不重要
I don't think it mattered.

897
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,320
她是合伙人  我只是律师
She was a partner; I was an associate.

898
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,940
是  如果她来这  一样如此
Yes, and if she came here, it would be the same thing.

899
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,210
你觉得如何
Would you like that here?

900
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,970
老天爷  帮帮我吧
Oh, God, Jesus. God, help me.

901
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,240
这何时变成这儿的标准了
Since when is that the criteria here?

902
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,540
卢卡
Lucca?

903
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,840
是否该让戴安加入成为合伙人
Should we bring in Diane as a partner?

904
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,980
是的
Yes.

905
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,590
为什么
Why?

906
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,850
因为她是个能干的律师
She's a good lawyer.

907
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,810
热忱  心怀大道又经验老道
She's passionate, idealistic and cunning.

908
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,440
还需要我什么事情吗
Anything else?

909
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,040
没有了
No.

910
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,710
她会是律所不可多得之宝
She would be an asset.

911
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,550
多谢了
Thanks.

912
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,510
这样嘛
Well...

913
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,570
和我预料的发展方向相反呢
...that went in a different direction than I thought.

914
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,600
不能让她当冠名合伙人
She can't be a name partner.

915
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,830
我没说让她当冠名合伙人
I didn't offer her that.

916
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,430
初级合伙人即可
Junior partner is fine.

917
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,140
还有与初级合伙人相匹配的股权
With an equal equity draw.

918
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,060
别再擅自改变策略了
Don't you ever call an audible again.

919
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,330
没问题
You got it.

920
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,980
天啊  他们说手上
Oh, my God, they're saying

921
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,710
有我们的性爱视频
they have a sex tape of us.

922
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,320
TMZ独家视频
"TMZ, Exclusive footage:

923
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,520
玛娅·林德尔女同性爱视频
Maia Rindell lesbian sex tape."

924
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,230
别看了  关掉它
Oh, God, don't look at it. Just close it.

925
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,150
天  这简直就是激将法
Oh, my God, it's like waving a red flag at a bull.

926
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,720
{\an8}玛娅·林德尔女同性爱视频

927
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,040
我瞬间就变成诱惑拉拉的狐狸精了
Suddenly I'm a lesbian temptress?

928
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,090
这根本就不是我们  这人还有纹身
This isn't even us. This person has a tattoo.

929
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,060
好了听我说  你要保持镇静  好吗
Okay, listen to me, you have to stay sane, okay?

930
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,830
你得无视掉这些东西
You have to ignore this stuff.

931
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,840
明眼人都知道他们全都在撒谎
They're obviously lying. All of 'em, right?

932
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,110
他们整个家族都是
The whole family.

933
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,520
你要走了
Are you leaving?

934
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,640
是的
Yes.

935
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,630
去哪里
For where?

936
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:48,910
另一家律所
Another firm.

937
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,660
我不想离婚
I don't want a divorce.

938
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,320
或许是明智之举  但是我  我并不想要
Maybe it's smart, but I... I don't want it.

939
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,350
他们会冻结你的账户的
They'll freeze your account.

940
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,110
冻结就冻结吧
Let 'em.

941
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,630
库尔特  你不是一个牛仔啊
Kurt, you're not a cowboy.

942
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,380
我们不是生活在牛仔随心所欲的世界里
We don't live in a world with cowboys.

943
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,780
我不想要一点挽回的余地都没有
I don't want the door to close completely.

944
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,490
我们之间已经没有挽回的余地了

945
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,180
那你去提离婚好了
Then divorce me.

946
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,190
反正我这边不会提的
But I won't do it.

947
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,100
我父母看到了那个视频
My parents saw the tape.

948
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,240
他们认为是我们在做爱
They think it's us having sex.

949
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,900
告诉他们不是真的
Tell them it's not.

950
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,530
他们不相信我
They don't believe me.

951
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,010
对不起
I'm sorry.

952
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,020
我要去雷迪克&博斯曼了
I'm going to Reddick & Boseman.

953
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,340
什么
What?

00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,320
我要离开这里跳去雷迪克&博斯曼了
I'm leaving here and going to Reddick & Boseman.

955
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,680
有一堆黑鬼的那个律所
Oh, the bunch of schvartzes?

956
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,890
你不能这么做
You can't do that.

957
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:03,570
我当然可以
Yes, I can. 

958
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,460
你如果给他们机要信息
You give them proprietary information,

959
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,770
我们就告你
we'll sue you.

960
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,970
我不需要这么做
I don't need to.

961
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,140
那么你一直在跟着的
Well, what about the police brutality case

962
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,160
警察虐待案怎么办
You've been working on?

963
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,930
这个就交给你处理了
I'm handing it off to you.

964
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,710
还有你估计得看看这个
Oh, and you may want to look at this.

965
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,440
警察们没有被挑衅哦
The police were unprovoked.

966
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,910
我可能会有估算误差  但看来
I could be wrong, but it looks like

967
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,310
600万在向我招手
a $6 million payout to me.

968
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,380
总之  再见了
Anyway, good-bye.

969
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,230
我在这里挺开心的
It was fun.

970
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,020
要我关门吗
Want the door closed?

971
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,010
能请你站起来吗
Could you please stand up?

站那儿去
Stand over there.

973
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,740
桌上有任何你的东西吗
Is there anything on this desk that is yours?

974
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,230
没有
Uh, no.

975
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,860
对了  听说你被炒鱿鱼了
Oh, hey, I heard you got fired.

976
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,130
真可惜  之前我还觉得花儿挺漂亮的
Too bad, I thought the flowers looked good.

977
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,030
阿德里安  我是戴安
Adrian, it's Diane.

978
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,900
几个小时内你将会接到来自这个律所的电话
In a few hours you're gonna get a call from this firm

979
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,950

981
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,800
我只是想让你知道  找到关键证据的
I, um, I just want you to know, there's an associate here

982
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,750
是这儿的一个律师
Who found the key piece of evidence

983
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,240
是整个案子的转折点
that the case turned on,

984
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,130
然而她刚刚被炒了
and she was just fired.

985
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,770
你忘东西了
You left this.

986
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,510
给需要的人吧
Give it to someone who needs it.

987

我不干了
I'm done.

989

某个地方

992
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:38,890
为什么
Why?

993
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,690
因为还没完呢
Because it's not over yet.
