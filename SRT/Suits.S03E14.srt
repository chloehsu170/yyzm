1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,310
 《訴訟雙雄》前情提要

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,580
為什么我被停職了  我沒有泄露任何文件
Why am I being suspended? I didn't leak any documents.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,420
你受罰不公
You were unfairly punished,

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,020
而我想正式歡迎你回到公司
and I would like to officially welcome you back.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,390
-我要加薪  -行
- I want a raise. - Fine.

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,420
如果我決定上法學院
And Pearson Hardman pays for law school

7
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,780
皮爾遜·哈德曼會報銷學費
when I decide to go.

8
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,000
同意
Agreed.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,120
我替你付了買入股份款
I fronted your buy-in.

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,140
你怎么能這么做
How could you do that?

11
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,710
你都打算去別的地方工作了
You were about to take a job somewhere else.

12
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,040
我們應該開始對彼此坦誠
We need to start being honest with each other.

13
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,090
你把我撤下來
You want me off this case,

14
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,250
是為了讓我遠離聚光燈
so I don't get anywhere near the spotlight.

15
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,630
從你的角度出發
In your position,

16
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,960
聚光燈可以很快的
the spotlight can become an interrogation lamp

17
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,200
變成審訊燈
pretty damn fast.

18
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,450
以后都會這樣了  對嗎
This is always how it's gonna be, isn't it?

19
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,890
我以為你知道
I thought you knew that.

20
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,100
我知道
I guess I did.

21
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,780
我想讓你利用你的力量
I need you to use your power

22
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,450
從斯科特那里幫我把案子搶過來
to give me this case over Scottie.

23
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,710
你是作為朋友求我  還是讓我還人情
Are you asking as a friend, or are you calling in a chit?

24
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,680
還人情
Calling in a chit.

25
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,060
這和他之前幫你的那個忙有關系嗎
Does this have something to do with that favor he did you?

26
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,920
-是的  -那告訴我是什么事
- Yes. - Tell me what it is.

27
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,730
不行
I can't.

28
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,840
看來我們終究沒有
Guess we're not sharing everything

29
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,430
分享所有秘密了
with each other after all.

30
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,320
該起床了  親愛的
Time to wake up, sweetie.

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,150
再讓我睡五分鐘  媽
Oh, five more minutes, Mom.

32
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,800
你剛剛是叫我"媽"了嗎
Did you just call me Mom?

33
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
什么  才沒有
What? No.

34
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,730
路易  我以前就說過
Louis, I've said it before.

35
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,110
臥室不許說媽媽
The bedroom is a no-mom-talk zone.

36
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,410
明白
Understood.

37
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,030
你還要趕地鐵呢
You have to catch your train.

38
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,690
那就坐下一班
I'll take the later one.

39
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,660
你誰啊
Who are you,

40
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,290
把我的男朋友路易·利特怎么了
and what have you done with my boyfriend, Louis Litt?

41
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,400
你是說那個
Oh, you mean the guy

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,470
在結案陳詞前會汗如泉涌的家伙嗎
who sweats profusely before closing arguments?

43
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,070
對  那家伙不見了
Yeah. Yeah, that guy's gone.

44
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,120
真的嗎
Really?

45
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,110
天哪
Oh, my God.

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,890
你身上一滴汗都沒有
You're completely dry.

47
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,690
都是因為你的愛  希拉
Your love has made me dry, Sheila.

48
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,440
我已經改頭換面了
I'm a changed man.

49
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,170
事實上  我要再讓你爽上一個小時
In fact... I'm gonna rock your world for one more hour,

50
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,570
然后出庭殺他們個片甲不留
and then I'm gonna kick some ass in court.

51
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,230
因為今天一切都會很順利
'cause today nothing can go wrong.

52
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,740
今天哥說了算
Today is my goddamn day.

53
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,860
太對了
Yeah. It is.

54
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,280
能把糖給我嗎
Can you pass the sugar?

55
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,530
好
Yeah, of course.

56
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,660
那牛奶呢
Okay, how 'bout that milk?

57
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,900
很好啊
Sounds great.

58
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,340
現在我們都同居了  我跟另一個女人約會
How would you feel about me dating other women

59
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,070
你有什么感覺
now that we're living together and all?

60
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,600
匹薩很好啊
Pizza's perfect.

61
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,290
瑞秋
Rachel.

62
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,530
你怎么了
What's going on?

63
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,620
我收到了學費付款時間表
I got my tuition payment schedule, and...

64
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,010
這么大一筆錢
That is a big bill.

65
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,730
是啊  但問題不在這兒
Yeah, and that's not even the problem.

66
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,980
還記得路易炒了我
Remember when Louis fired me

67
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,440
因為他以為我泄露了文件嗎
because he thought that I was leaking information?

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,860
我從沒跟你說過
I never told you about

69
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,880
作為補償我們談好的條件
negotiating the terms of my return.

70
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,450
你說過
Yeah, you did.

71
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,930
-他給你加薪10%  -不止這樣
- He gave you a 10% raise. - That's not all he gave me.

72
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,400
他同意  我去上法學院
He agreed that the firm would pay for me

73
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,810
律所會報銷學費
to go to law school when I got in.

74
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,830
那還有什么問題
So what's the problem?

75
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,680
這談話太尷尬了
It's gonna be an awkward conversation.

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,450
瑞秋  你要做律師
Rachel, you want to be a lawyer,

77
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,730
以后會有很多尷尬的談話
you're gonna have to have a lot of awkward conversations.

78
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,620
是  但不是這種
Yeah, but not like this.

79
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,140
我跑去說  "路易  還記得我要求
I mean, "Hey, Louis, do you remember when I demanded

80
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,980
你報銷我的法學院學費嗎"
"that you pay for me to go to law school?

81
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,600
"我知道我能被錄取  你出了不少力
"I get that since then you've now tried to help me get in

82
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,580
而且我們現在是朋友
"and that we're friends,

83
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,850
但你現在真得把錢給我"
but I would really like my money now."

84
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,360
好吧  那就別跟他說
Okay. So don't talk to him.

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,200
準備好寫一張二十萬的支票
Just get ready to write a check for $200,000,

86
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,210
因為這將是你未來三年的學費
because that's what it's gonna cost for the next three years.

87
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,990
-那就尷尬談話吧  -祝你好運
- Awkward conversation it is. - Best of luck.

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,000
諾瑪  我是路易
Norma, it's Louis.

89
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,410
路易·利特  你上司
Louis Litt, your boss.

90
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,970
現在別跟我耍把戲  女人
Don't play your games with me now, woman.

91
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,680
我半小時后要去做結案陳詞
I'm due for closing arguments in 30 minutes,

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,140
我要你幫我拖延一下
and I need you to stall.

93
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,690
不  不要去拉火警  行嗎
No, you do not pull the fire alarm as a tactic, okay?

94
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,140
我要你在不犯罪的情況下
I need you to just buy me ten minutes

95
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,670
幫我拖延十分鐘
without committing a crime.

96
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,590
出租車
Taxi!

97
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,110
來吧  寶貝  乖孩子
There we go. Come on, baby. My man.

98
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,850
不不不  別想搶我的車
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't you upstream me.

99
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,760
這是我的出租車  是我的
That's my cab. That's my taxi.

100
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,800
這是我的出租車
This is my cab. This is my cab.

101
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,520
我要起訴你  我要起訴你這么賤
Hey, I'm gonna sue you. I'm gonna sue you for sucking.

102
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,180
我要起訴你沒有...
I'm gonna sue you for not being--

103
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,790
我要你的姓名和出生年月  我要...
Okay, I need your name, date of birth, and I need--

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,060
好了  "給利"點吧
All right, let's Litt this up.

105
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,830
你對斯科特做了什么
What did you do to Scottie?

106
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,490
-沒什么  -這可不是沒什么
- Nothing. - That is not nothing.

107
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,990
這可是一杯豆奶焦糖拿鐵
That is a soy caramel latte

108
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,480
另加雙份害怕和內疚
with a double shot of fear and guilt.

109
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,580
這是一杯道歉咖啡
That is an apology coffee.

110
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,190
為什么就不是"最佳男友"咖啡
Why can't it just be an "I'm a great boyfriend" coffee?

111
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,090
如果你真這么好
If you're such a great boyfriend,

112
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,550
怎么會不知道你女友正在去芝加哥
why don't you know that your girlfriend is on her way

113
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,760
給韋克斯勒取證的路上
to Chicago for the Wexler deposition?

114
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,470
我再問一遍  你做了什么
So I repeat, what did you do?

115
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,900
我搶走了弗蘭克林·科利爾的案子
I overruled her on Franklin Courier.

116
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,280
我逼她把案子還給了路易
I made her give the case back to Louis.

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,950
你插手了
You got in the middle of it?

118
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,720
為什么
Why would you do that?

119
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,660
我現在不想說這件事  唐娜
Look, I don't want to get into it right now, Donna.

120
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,380
好吧
Okay.

121
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,660
不過哈維  如果你真這么對她了
But, Harvey, if you really did do that to her,

122
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,970
咖啡可擺不平
coffee isn't gonna cut it.

123
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,980
正式說一句  我不是這個目的
For the record, this was not my goal.

124
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,830
利特先生
Mr. Litt.

125
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,820
抱歉  法官大人  我遲到了
Sorry, your honor. Sorry I'm late.

126
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,750
你準備好結案陳詞了嗎
Are you ready for closing arguments?

127
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,160
是的
Yes, I am.

128
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,010
陪審團的女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

129
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,980
控方律師指控了我的委托人很多事
opposing counsel has accused my client of a great many things.

130
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,470
但問題在于
But you see, here's the problem.

131
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,780
他們的指控根本沒有事實根據
They don't have one single fact to back up their claim.

132
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,070
完全沒有
I mean, not one.

133
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,960
你們知道我要做什么嗎  我要挑戰你們
So you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna challenge you.

134
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,460
不  別說挑戰了
Actually, no, scratch that.

135
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,800
你們敢不敢找出
I'm gonna dare you to find dispute

136
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,740
我方呈堂證據的漏洞吧
with the facts of this case as we presented them.

137
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,340
你是好人嗎
'cause are you a good person?

138
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,610
是的
Yes.

139
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,390
你是好人嗎  是的
Are you a good person? Yes.

140
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,700
你是  你還記筆記  說明你重視這案子
Are you--actually, you took notes, so I can see you care.

141
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,670
這  就是一個模范陪審團
You see, this is the kind of jury that they teach about.

142
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,670
這樣的陪審團  會聽進去
This is the kind of jury that's gonna hear me

143
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,280
我要說的這三個字
when I say these four words.

144
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,610
你們知道是哪三個字嗎
Do you know what those four words are?

145
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,420
我要你們記住這三個字
Because I want you to remember these four words

146
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,020
一直記到死
to your dying breath.

147
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,880
他  沒  做
He didn't do it!

148
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,210
他沒做
He didn't do it.

149
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,680
利特先生  你沒事吧
Mr. Litt, are you okay?

150
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,470
沒事的  我沒事
I'm all right. Yeah, I'm fine.

151
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,580
法警  叫救護車

第三季   第十四集

160
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,000
就這些了吧  完事了吧
Was that it, are we done?

161
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,000
哈維  你才簽了三張支票
Harvey, you've signed three checks.

162
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,100
怎么了
And?

163
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,170
走吧
Just go.

164
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,130
對了  邁克·羅斯怎么樣了
Oh, by the way, how's Mike Ross doing?

165
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,910
什么意思
What are you talking about?

166
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,780
他剛剛整了斯坦普爾啊
He just came up with the huge Stemple solution.

167
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,800
他好著呢
He's doing great.

168
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,360
看來他沒把我們的對話告訴你了
So I guess he didn't tell you about our little conversation?

169
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,580
什么對話
What conversation?

170
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,500
讓他意識到他的天隨時都可能塌下來的對話
The one where he ran into the fact that he has a glass ceiling.

171
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,050
邁克知道這一點
Mike knows he has a glass ceiling.

172
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,520
現在知道了  之前沒有
He knows, but he didn't know.

173
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,610
我們跟威廉·貝克有點問題
We have a problem with William Beck.

174
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,870
那是誰
Who's William Beck?

175
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,220
海岸容光防曬霜的部門主任
Division head of Coastal Radiance Sunscreen.

176
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,610
他想毀約
He's trying to break his contract.

177
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,220
他簽了競爭沖突條款吧
I assume he has a non-compete.

178
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,370
不  哈維  我蠢到讓他隨心所欲
No, Harvey, I was dumb enough to let him do whatever he wants.

179
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,490
他為什么要離開
Why is he trying to leave?

180
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,650
他有些關于生產線的想法
He has some ideas about the product line

181
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,210
我們不肯實施
that we're not implementing.

182
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,320
他收到其他工作邀請了嗎
Does he have another offer?

183
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,400
-露得清想請他  -不能讓他們得逞
- Neutrogena wants him. - They can't have him.

184
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,130
他可以去星巴克打工  但別想涉足這個市場
He can go work at Starbucks, but he's not touching this market.

185
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,290
抱歉  但或許有其他解決方案
Excuse me, but maybe there's a solution.

186
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,500
海岸容光這一分別專門做保濕護膚品
Coastal Radiance is a division of pure moisture skincare.

187
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,970
把他們改成子公司
Spin them off.

188
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,870
貝克能經營自己的公司
Beck gets to run his own company,

189
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,660
兩家公司的股票都能上漲  對大家都有利
both stocks go up, everybody wins.

190
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,200
如果我想要初級律師來想辦法
If I had wanted the junior associate to come up with an idea,

191
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,340
我就會讓初級律師來想辦法了
I'd have asked the junior associate to come up with an idea.

192
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,610
托尼  他說的沒錯
Tony, he's not wrong.

193
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,030
海岸容光的價值被低估了
Coastal Radiance is undervalued,

194
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,460
這正好能解決這問題
and this fixes that.

195
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,790
貝克已經給我們干了十年了
Beck has been with us for ten years.

196
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,180
或許可以估一下改子公司的成本
Maybe it's worth running the numbers on the spin-off.

197
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,660
我不想估價
I don't want to run the numbers.

198
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,290
我要他馬上滾蛋
I want him out now.

199
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,580
讓你的手下準備好解職文件
So have your boy work up the exit paperwork.

200
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,120
喬納森會簽字的
Jonathan will sign off.

201
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,960
你的公司  你說了算
Your company, your call.

202
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,170
要跟我談談剛剛在里面發生的事嗎
You want to talk about what just happened in there?

203
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,260
不太想談
Not particularly.

204
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,470
你的主意不錯  他該聽你的
Look, it was a good idea. He should've listened to it.

205
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,370
我知道這主意不錯
I know it was a good idea.

206
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,050
我不明白的是你為什么不爭取一下
What I don't know is why you didn't push back.

207
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,540
你剛剛在不在里面啊  我爭取了
Were you in there? I did push back.

208
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,760
你真心爭取的時候  能改變別人的想法
When you push back, you change people's minds,

209
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,450
所以你要么是不認同我的看法
which means either you didn't agree with me

210
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,220
要么就是你懶得去改變他的主意
or you don't care enough to change his mind.

211
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,650
我知道什么時候該去勸人改主意
Look, I know when it's time to change someone's mind

212
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,460
什么時候不行
and when it isn't,

213
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,430
如果剛剛會面時我態度再強硬一些
and all pushing harder in that meeting would've done

214
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,600
也只會讓他更堅決
was make him dig in.

215
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,830
有人贊同我們的  喬納森同意我的主意
We had an ally. Jonathan agreed with me.

216
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,870
對  但隨后他還是服從他老板的意思
Yeah, and then he agreed with his boss,

217
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,930
而我們也得聽他老板的
which is what we're gonna do,

218
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,110
因為這世界就是這樣
because it's the way the world works.

219
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,200
-得了  哈維  -邁克
- Come on, Harvey. - Mike.

220
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,290
這人換律師比換內褲還勤
This man goes through lawyers like a hot knife through butter,

221
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,700
我不能害我們被炒
and I wasn't about to get us fired

222
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,690
只為了保護一個我完全不在乎的人
to protect some guy I don't even give a shit about.

223
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,480
你明白了嗎
Now are you on board with that?

224
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,460
我明白了  能說別的了嗎
I'm on board. Can we move on?

225
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,190
-我沒別的可說  -我有
- I have nothing to move on to. - I do.

226
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,970
你給斯科特打電話道歉了嗎
Have you called Scottie and apologized yet?

227
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,980
道什么歉
Apologize for what?

228
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,610
你是道歉警察嗎
What are you, the apology police?

229
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,820
如果你要受調查
If you're the one under investigation,

230
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,240
我一定加入
I'll sign up for that.

231
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,560
杰西卡  如果你又要找我簽支票
Jessica, if you need me to sign any more checks,

232
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,230
-那現在時機正合適  -是路易的事
- now would be a great time. - It's Louis.

233
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,890
我猜猜
Let me guess.

234
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,560
他雖然沒去參加會議
Even though he didn't show up to the meeting,

235
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,610
卻覺得我們排擠他  于是大發脾氣
he's feeling left out and throwing a hissy fit.

236
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,470
他今早在庭上心臟病發
He had a heart attack in court this morning.

237
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,350
天吶
Oh, my God.

238
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,240
他沒事
He's okay.

239
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,980
我打了電話
I made a call,

240
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,370
給他找了西奈山醫學院最好的心臟病專家
he's got the best cardiologists at Mount Sinai,

241
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,830
那邊說他不會有事
and they say he's going to be fine.

242
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,460
我們應該去看他
We should go see him.

243
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,140
他跟諾瑪說他不希望大家去見他
He told Norma he didn't want anybody to come.

244
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,830
就是說他不好意思  但他希望我去的
That means he's embarrassed, but he wants me there.

245
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,400
我不一定什么時候回來
I'll be back when I'm back.

246
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,080
我們要親自接手他的案子
We handle all his cases personally.

247
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,790
掛著路易名字的案子絕不能掉鏈子
Nothing with Louis' name on it falls through the cracks.

248
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,250
不能讓客戶知道發生了什么事
No client finds out this happened.

249
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,070
-沒問題  -沒問題
- Done. - Done.

250
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,500
我會替我們大家送花給他
I'll send him flowers from all of us.

251
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,620
不行
No.

252
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,010
他過敏
He's allergic.

253
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,220
對花過敏
To flowers?

254
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,420
對所有花嗎
All of them?

255
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,000
你怎么知道
How do you even know that?

256
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,390
我們還是初級律師時
I used to send them to his desk every day

257
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,830
我每天給他送花
when we were associates.

258
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,840
我知道
I know.

259
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,200
我混蛋
I'm an asshole.

260
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,880
他不會有事吧
He's gonna be okay, right?

261
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,550
天啊
Oh, my God.

262
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,330
這太糟了
This is awful.

263
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,490
是啊
Yeah, I know.

264
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,320
我一整個早上都在想著
All morning all I've been thinking about is how

265
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,150
我多不想跟他談學費的事
I don't want to talk to him about the tuition, and now--

266
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,540
瑞秋  別這樣
Hey, Rachel, Rachel. Hey, come on.

267
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,520
看著我
Look at me.

268
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,850
他不會有事的
He's gonna be okay.

269
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,940
他會回來  你們有的是時間
He'll be back, and you guys can have a lifetime

270
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,490
一起工作  一起去看芭蕾
of working together, going to the ballet,

271
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,800
討論些真正尷尬的事
having really awkward conversations.

272
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,750
瑞秋  我下面要說的話
Rachel, I'm gonna say the thing

273
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,050
你可能不會想聽
that I know you don't want to hear.

274
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,930
我現在不想管那些
I don't care about that right now.

275
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,180
這不是什么大事
It doesn't have to be a big deal.

276
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,050
我們都在幫助路易
We've all got Louis' back right now,

277
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,880
而且這種事本來就是杰西卡處理
and Jessica handles this stuff anyway.

278
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,740
去跟她談談
Just talk to her.

279
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,390
我絕不允許你犯心臟病
You are never allowed to have a heart attack.

280
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,820
好嗎
Okay?

281
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,160
遵命
Understood.

282
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,870
路易
Louis.

283
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,230
這是天堂嗎
Is this heaven?

284
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,150
我不知道你為什么會這么想
I can understand why you would think that,

285
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,590
但不是的
But no.

286
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,710
我不知道這是怎么發生的
I don't know how this can happen.

287
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,040
我對我的身體這么在意
I...treat my body like a temple.

288
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,270
但是你也有每周末加班啊
And you've also been commuting every weekend,

289
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,510
而且還老讓你手下的律師氣得你血壓升高
and you let the associates raise your blood pressure.

290
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,600
那是因為他們蠢
It's because they're stupid.

291
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,990
行了  路易  放松
Okay, Louis, relax.

292
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,960
醫生說你脫離危險了
The doctors say you're out of danger,

293
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,290
但你不能情緒激動
but you shouldn't get worked up.

294
00:11:35,370 --> 00:12:35,370
人人影視
YYeTs.com

295
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,530
醫生得允許我出院
The doctors need to let me go.

296
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,180
你剛剛才心臟病發了
You had a heart attack.

297
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,830
假如我的供血少斷半秒鐘
If my blood supply had been cut off for a half-second less,

298
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,830
這次就只會被歸類為一次小心臟事件了
it would've been classified as a minor cardiac event.

299
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,820
那假如多斷了半秒鐘呢
And what if it would have lasted half a second more?

300
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,840
沒多斷
It didn't.

301
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,080
我得回去工作
And I need to get to work.

302
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,840
路易  我是認真的  你得緩緩了
Louis, I'm serious. You have to cut back.

303
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,220
你有可能就這樣死了啊
You could have died.

304
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,470
而假如你出了什么事的話
And if anything were to happen to you...

305
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,830
哈維會變得一團糟  明白嗎
Harvey would be a total mess. Okay?

306
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,590
我會緩緩的
I'll cut back.

307
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,930
那就好
Good.

308
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,180
打擾了  你是叫邁克吧  是嗎
Excuse me. It's mike, right?

309
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,840
是的  你還需要什么嗎
Yeah. Did you still need something?

310
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,040
因為我這邊還沒搞定
Because I haven't finished yet.

311
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,150
確實需要  我一直在找路易
I did. I've been trying to find louis.

312
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,090
他之前沒去開會
He wasn't at the meeting.

313
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,000
-路易現在不在這兒  -那他在哪里
- Louis isn't here. - Where is he?

314
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,720
你要找他干什么
What did you need to see him about?

315
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,040
我想談談發生了什么
I want to talk about what happened.

316
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,930
好吧
Yeah, um,

317
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,060
我知道我倆都認為
look, I know that we both agreed

318
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,260
分拆是個更好的辦法  但是
that a spin-off was the better way to go, but--

319
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,260
分拆:從原公司分出一部分  成立獨立的公司

320
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,750
我不想談這個
I don't want to talk about that.

321
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,530
我想談談我自己
I want to talk about me.

322
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,580
我想退出
I want out.

323
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,630
你想離開揚諾普洛斯
You want to leave Gianopolous

324
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,960
就因為今天早上發生的事嗎
because of what happened this morning?

325
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,580
今天早上發生的事情每天都會上演一遍
What happened this morning happens every day.

326
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,650
他會打壓達到了一定位置的人
He keeps people down when they reach a certain point,

327
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,320
而我確定我現在就在那個位置
and I'm pretty sure I'm at that point.

328
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,620
-是的  我明白了  -不  你不明白
- Yeah, I get it. - No, you don't.

329
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,790
你不明白的  你不
You don't. No.

330
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,690
在像這樣的地方
In a place like this,

331
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,480
你的整個未來鋪展在你面前
your whole future's laid out for you.

332
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,910
你四十歲之前就能接管這里
You'll be running the place before 40.

333
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,910
喬納森  我們是為托尼·揚諾普洛斯工作的
Jonathan, we work for Tony Gianopolous.

334
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,340
雖然我知道自己沒必要告訴你
And I know I don't have to tell you,

335
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,410
但你和威廉·貝克是受同一個
but you're working under the same non-compete

336
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,240
非競爭條款約束的
that William Beck is.

337
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,840
但你們也是為我工作的
But you work for me too.

338
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,600
路易是我的私人律師
Louis is my personal attorney.

339
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,210
我知道
I know.

340
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,070
但假如出現了利益沖突
But if there's a conflict of interest,

341
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,190
我們是會站在他那邊的
we're gonna choose him.

342
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,920
我知道你們有沖突
I know that you have a conflict.

343
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,280
我就問問  有沒有什么辦法你們能幫我
I'm just asking, is there any way that you can help me

344
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,390
而且
without...

345
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,190
不是刻意幫助我
helping me?

346
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,580
抱歉了
I'm sorry.

347
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,070
那路易在哪里
Then where's Louis?

348
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,540
路易現在出差去了
Louis is away on business right now,

349
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,260
所以他也幫不了你
so he can't help you either.

350
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,820
那我就找個能幫我的人
Then I'll find someone who will.

351
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,360
這把這當成是我炒掉他的正式通知吧
Let this serve as formal notice I'm letting him go.

352
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,290
密西根州上訴法院
Michigan court of appeals.

353
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,650
什么
What?

354
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,070
幾年前那里有個判決
There was a ruling a few years ago

355
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,860
承認了非競爭條款中的一個薄弱環節
that established a weak link in the non-compete.

356
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,900
抱歉打擾了  您有時間嗎
I'm sorry to interrupt. Do you have a minute?

357
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,190
我能為你做點什么
What can I do for you?

358
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,060
現在真不是提這個的好時機
The timing on this is terrible,

359
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,780
我為此道歉
and I-I apologize for that.

360
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,750
是什么事
What is it?

361
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,130
我需要付法學院學費的第一張支票
I need the first check for my law school tuition.

362
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,420
你說什么
Excuse me?

363
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,650
可能您不記得了  但當我被錯誤的解雇時
Maybe you don't remember, but when I was wrongfully dismissed,

364
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,020
回聘我的條件之一
one of the terms of my rehiring

365
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,020
就是律所幫我支付法學院的學費
was that the firm pays for my law school.

366
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,290
我記得可清楚了
I remember just fine.

367
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,570
而且我記得回聘你的唯一條件
And the only term of your rehiring

368
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,840
就是把你的工資上調10%
was a 10% increase in salary.

369
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,250
什么
What?

370
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,550
不  我告訴您  這是商定好了的條件
No, I'm--I'm telling you this was an agreed-upon term,

371
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,060
-而且  - 而且我告訴你
- and-- - and I'm telling you

372
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,820
我對此毫不知情
I know nothing about that.

373
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,240
還有就算我知道這件事
And if I had heard about it,

374
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,670
我也絕對不會同意的
I would have never approved it.

375
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,630
我給這家律所當了替罪羊
I was scapegoated by this firm.

376
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,310
所以當你同意回來時
And when you agreed to come back,

377
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,890
我們給你加了10%的工資
you were given a 10% raise.

378
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,890
那是標準
That's standard.

379
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,950
我這可不是標準情況
My situation was not standard.

380
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,350
在哪方面不是
In what way?

381
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,450
路易指控我對公司不忠
Louis accused me of being disloyal.

382
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,510
然后呢
And?

383
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,870
然后最后發現他錯了
And he turned out to be wrong.

384
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,630
瑞秋  問題是
The problem, Rachel,

385
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,730
你口說無憑
is that you have no record of what you're saying.

386
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,040
他同意了的
He agreed to it.

387
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,490
他是您手下的人
He is your agent.

388
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,190
您和他是綁在一塊的
You're bound by this.

389
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,650
我不知道這件事
I don't know that.

390
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,810
而且那人剛剛心臟病發了
And the man just had a heart attack.

391
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,170
所以我也不會打電話問他這件事
And I'm not going to call him and ask him.

392
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,700
我知道  我也不希望你打
I know that, and I don't want you to.

393
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,750
那這個談話就結束了
Then this conversation is over.

394
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,650
艾弗森醫生  請到心臟實驗室
Dr. Iverson to the cardiac lab.

395
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,060
艾弗森醫生  請到心臟實驗室
Dr. Iverson to the cardiac lab.

396
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,560
-你這到底是在干什么  -希拉
- What the hell are you doing?  - Sheila.

397
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,490
-我很抱歉  -你確實應該
- I'm so sorry.  - You should be.

398
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,760
我不知道我怎么會有心臟病
I don't know why I had a heart attack,

399
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,190
但我保證這不會再發生了
but I promise it won't happen again.

400
00:15:35,370 --> 00:16:35,370
人人影視
YYeTs.com

401
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,520
你以為我是因為你心臟病發而生氣嗎
You think I'm mad because you had a heart attack?

402
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,050
這是軟弱的表現  你恨軟弱
It's a sign of weakness. You hate weakness.

403
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,060
不  我恨的是你居然還在工作
No, I hate that you're doing work.

404
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,120
-希拉...  -不  路易
- Sheila-- - No, Louis,

405
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,780
你知道我來這里的一路上在想什么嗎
do you know what I was thinking about the whole way down here?

406
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,980
我在想假如你死了
I was thinking that if you died,

407
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,360
我也不想活了
I'd want to die too.

408
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,260
所以你最好開始好好照顧自己
So you better start taking care of yourself,

409
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,340
因為我不想...
because I don't want to--

410
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,160
-希拉...  -不  不許再工作了
- Sheila-- - No. No more work.

411
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,230
好的  但這不是你想象的那樣
Okay, but this isn't what you think it is.

412
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,140
別和我爭這個  拜托了
Don't fight me on this, please.

413
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,730
好吧  但是我需要那個
Okay, but I need that--

414
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,180
別和我爭這個
Don't fight me on this!

415
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,300
"希拉  自從我認識你以來
"Sheila, as long as I've known you,

416
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,170
我一直有...
I've had a...

417
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,350
我一直有一種完滿的感覺
I've had a feeling of completeness.

418
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,680
羅密歐與朱麗葉
Romeo and Juliet.

419
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,430
安東尼與克莉奧佩特拉[埃及艷后]"
Antony and Cleopatra."

420
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,320
你把詹姆和瑟曦·蘭尼斯特劃掉了
You crossed out Jaime and Cersei Lannister.

421
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,320
《冰與火之歌》角色

422
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,090
我覺得這對太有爭議性了[親兄妹]
I thought they were too controversial a couple.

423
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,580
對什么而言太有爭議性了
Too controversial for what?

424
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,490
對求婚而言
A proposal.

425
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,670
什么
What?

426
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,760
希拉  我本可能死掉的
Sheila, I could've died.

427
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,790
而我不希望我的人生終結了卻沒能...
And I don't want my life to have ended without--

428
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,800
路易  我不希望你問出你將要問我的問題
Louis, I don't want you to ask me what you're about to ask me

429
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,270
只是因為你不想孤老終生
because you're afraid to die alone.

430
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,550
不是的
No.

431
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,120
這個和那個無關
It's not about that.

432
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,300
這和孤老終生無關
It's not about dying alone.

433
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,970
這事關過一種沒有我愛的女人的生活
It's about living without the woman I love.

434
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,970
希拉·阿曼達·塞茲
Sheila Amanda Sazs,

435
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,830
你是我此生摯愛  希望此生永久
You are the love of what I hope will be my very, very long life.

436
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,460
沒有你的日子  我一秒都過不下去
And I can't spend one more second of it without you.

437
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,580
你愿意嫁給我嗎
Will you marry me?

438
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,480
我愿意
Yes.

439
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,800
我愿意嫁給你
Yes, I'll marry you.

440
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,220
托尼  有什么能幫你的嗎
Tony, what can I do for you?

441
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,700
你耍了我
You screwed me over.

442
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,090
就因為我想辦法炒了你讓我們炒的人
By figuring out how to fire the guy you told us to fire?

443
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,790
因為你教我的副手如何違背非競爭條款
By telling my Number Two how to break his non-compete.

444
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,990
-我沒干過這種事  -那就是路易·利特
- I did nothing of the kind. - Then it was Louis Litt.

445
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,210
不可能  根本沒這種事
No way. That did not happen.

446
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,130
少扯淡  哈維  我們開過會了
That's bullshit, Harvey, we had a meeting.

447
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,830
喬納森本來文書工作做得好好的
Jonathan stuck around for the paperwork.

448
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,800
突然他帶著辭職信來了
Then suddenly he comes back with his resignation

449
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,480
還有密歇根上訴法院關于破壞這種協議的
and some Michigan appeals court precedent

450
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,370
判決先例
for breaking our deal.

451
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,590
他肯定沒見過路易
Well, he couldn't have met with Louis

452
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,190
路易都不在辦公室
because Louis wasn't even in the office.

453
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,280
那就是別人
Then it was someone else.

454
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,500
托尼  你到底想怎么樣
Tony, what exactly do you want?

455
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,730
你想讓我像炒了貝克一樣炒了他嗎
You want me to fire him like we're firing Beck?

456
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,240
告訴你一個小秘密
I'll tell you a little secret.

457
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,180
我壓根不在乎貝克走不走
I don't give a shit whether Beck goes or not.

458
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,430
不過你知道我為什么想整垮他嗎
But can you understand why I want him crushed?

459
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,180
因為你想讓喬納森·西德威爾那樣的人
Because you want people like Jonathan Sidwell

460
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,440
知道試圖離開的后果
to know what happens when they try to leave.

461
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,070
我的律師總算是開竅了
Finally my lawyer shows up.

462
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,990
我一直都心中有數
Oh, I've been here the whole time.

463
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,410
隨你怎么說
You see it how you want to see it.

464
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,070
不過如果你不能想辦法留住喬納森
But if you can't figure out a way to make Jonathan stay,

465
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,850
要走的就是你
you'll be the one who's gone.

466
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,210
托尼
Tony.

467
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,320
這事我會處理  不過話要說清楚
I'm gonna fix this, but let's get one thing clear.

468
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,830
我和之前那些被你炒掉律師不一樣
I'm not like the other lawyers you've burned through.

469
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,660
如果下次你再像個四歲小孩一樣
So the next time you go stomping around

470
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,570
氣得跳腳  沖我亂發脾氣
like a four-year-old throwing tantrums with me,

471
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,910
我會先炒了你
I'll be the one getting rid of you.

472
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,870
看來你還是沒跟我一起行動
Guess you were never really on board after all.

473
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,710
什么  我起草了關于貝克的文件了
What? I did the paperwork for Beck.

474
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,710
我說的不是貝克
I'm not talking about Beck.

475
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,480
我說的是喬納森·西德威爾
I'm talking about Jonathan Sidwell.

476
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,980
密歇根上訴法庭聽著耳熟嗎
Michigan court of appeals sound familiar?

477
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,210
哈維  他打算炒了路易
Harvey, he was gonna fire Louis.

478
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,260
如果他向路易征求的是這種建議
If that's the advice he was looking for from Louis,

479
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,180
那他總會炒了他的
he'd have fired him anyway.

480
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,930
那喬納森也總會找到那個漏洞的
And Jonathan would've found that loophole anyway.

481
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,330
可他沒自己找  而是由你告訴了他
But instead he got it from you.

482
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,330
你想讓我怎么做  路易犯了心臟病
What do you want from me? Louis had a heart attack.

483
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,610
-杰西卡讓我們別...  -別找借口了
- Jessica told us not to--  - Don't hide behind that shit.

484
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,640
說重點吧
Let's get into what this is really about.

485
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,770
你在說什么
What the hell are you talking about?

486
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,650
我在說你和杰西卡的對話
I'm talking about your conversation with Jessica.

487
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,010
所以你才在我們見過揚諾普洛斯后
So that's why you were telling me my idea was so good

488
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,900
說我的主意很棒
after our Gianopolous meeting.

489
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,940
沒錯  我們談過了
Yeah. We had that conversation.

490
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,480
而且沒錯  談得糟透了
And yeah, it sucks.

491
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,430
但那與此無關
But this has nothing to do with that.

492
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,560
-那就證明  -證明什么
- Then prove it.  - Prove what?

493
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,260
他對自己的現狀很不滿
He's unhappy with his situation.

494
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,200
人對現狀不滿時  就會去找出路
When people are unhappy, they find a way out.

495
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,730
這就證明了我的觀點
Which brings me back to my point.

496
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,950
你確實沒跟我一起行動
You weren't really on board.

497
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,000
我說了  我處理好貝克了
I told you, I took care of Beck.

498
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,470
現在你也得處理好喬納森了
Well, now you're gonna do the same for Jonathan.

499
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,450
密歇根的法庭判決明確指出他...
The Michigan ruling clearly states that he has--

500
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,910
別給我引用法庭判決
Don't quote precedent to me.

501
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,280
是你找出了違反非競爭條款的方法
You figured out how he could break the non-compete,

502
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,890
那你就再去找出強制執行的方法
now figure out how to enforce it.

503
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,160
-哈維  -夠了
- Harvey--  - Enough.

504
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,630
只要你想  你會是個很出色的律師
You're a pretty good lawyer when you want to be,

505
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,060
所以這次不如試著站在我們這邊吧
so maybe try doing it for our side this time.

506
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,130
晚上過得很糟嗎
Bad night?

507
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,750
如果絞盡腦汁
Only if you call figuring out a way

508
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,790
毀人夢想算糟的話  那今晚是挺糟
to crush someone's hopes and dreams bad.

509
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,880
你呢
What about you?

510
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,730
那個尷尬的對話怎么樣了
You, uh, take care of that awkward conversation?

511
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,540
那不是尷尬  那是...
Yeah, it wasn't awkward. It was...

512
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,610
羞辱
humiliating.

513
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,060
路易根本沒跟杰西卡說過
Louis never actually told Jessica.

514
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,560
什么  太扯了
What? That's bullshit.

515
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,790
他承諾過我的  而他是公司的代表
He made a promise to you. He's an agent of the firm.

516
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,960
我從來沒想過會這樣
You know, I never thought about that.

517
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,570
或許我該直接沖到他病床前
Maybe I should just rush to his hospital bed

518
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,810
逼他承認他耍了我
and get him to admit that he screwed me over.

519
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,080
他怎么能這么騙我
How could he lie to me like that?

520
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,030
瑞秋  他為什么騙你這不重要
Rachel, why he lied to you doesn't matter.

521
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,470
-對我來說很重要  -你自己說的
- It matters to me.  - Well, you said it yourself.

522
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,060
你真想讓他難過嗎  就為了找出原因
Do you really want to upset him just to find out?

523
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,000
當然不
Of course not.

524
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,860
那就去掉情緒的因素
Then take the emotion out of it.

525
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,220
-你在說什么  -這是合同上的問題
- What are you talking about? - It's a contract problem.

526
00:20:35,370 --> 00:21:35,370
人人影視
YYeTs.com

527
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,660
想出辦法來強制執行合同
Figure out a way to enforce the contract.

528
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,400
有人想見你
I have someone here to see you.

529
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,090
唐娜  我現在沒時間見任何人
Donna, I don't have time to see anyone right--

530
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,000
看看誰來了  你之前都去哪兒了
Oh, look who it is. Where the hell have you been?

531
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,470
哈維  別那么刻薄  他剛犯過心臟病
Harvey, don't be a dick. He had a heart attack.

532
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,060
你以為犯個心臟病
And you think having a heart attack

533
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,930
就有權休假了
gives you the right to take the day off?

534
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,880
我還活著
I'm alive.

535
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,200
救命
Help me.

536
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,880
回抱他
Hug him back.

537
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,540
你倆單獨待會吧
I'm gonna let you two be alone.

538
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,700
我不是不喜歡這樣  不過...
Okay, not that I'm not enjoying this, but...

539
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,710
你不該在家待著嗎
shouldn't you be home?

540
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,130
不  醫生說我可以回來了
No, the doctor cleared me to come back.

541
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,620
希拉允許我每天工作半天
Sheila's allowing me half days.

542
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,240
剩下的半天
The other half of the day...

543
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,860
我就在家籌備婚禮
I'm at home planning my wedding.

544
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,360
你們訂婚了
You're engaged?

545
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,990
那是我人生中最美好的一刻
It's the happiest moment of my life.

546
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,050
我對準新娘深表同情
I'll send my condolences to the bride-to-be.

547
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,880
這種幽默感
That kind of sense of humor

548
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,940
正是我想要的伴郎所需要的
is exactly what I want of my best man.

549
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,640
路易  你是在請我當你的伴...
Louis, are you asking me to be your best--

550
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,570
哈維  在回答之前
Harvey, before you answer,

551
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,620
我很抱歉讓你在我和斯科特之間進退兩難
I am sorry my fight with Scottie put you in a bad situation.

552
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,650
我知道讓你還我人情
And I know calling in my chit with you

553
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,130
傷害了我們間的友誼  但...
jeopardized our friendship, but...

554
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
-路易  -聽我說完
- Louis--  - Let me just finish.

555
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,530
你說我不能二者兼得  但...
You said I can't have it both ways, but--

556
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,980
我很榮幸
I'd be honored.

557
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,780
謝謝你  哈維
Thank you, Harvey.

558
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,050
不客氣  路易
You're welcome, Louis.

559
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,150
-科瓦克先生  -什么事
- Mr. Kovacs. - Yes?

560
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,370
我是邁克·羅斯  皮爾遜-斯佩克特律所
Mike Ross. Pearson Specter.

561
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,070
我們有生意往來嗎
Do we have business together?

562
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,740
喬納森·西德威爾
Jonathan Sidwell.

563
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,890
我知道你給了他一份工作
I understand you made him an offer

564
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,570
管理你的投資部
to run your investment division.

565
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,180
喬納森給我看了一份提案  很合我意
Jonathan reached out to me with a proposal, and I liked it.

566
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,170
那他有沒有說起過
Did he happen to mention the fact

567
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,510
他簽了非競爭條款呢
that he's under a non-compete?

568
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,620
說了
Yes.

569
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,100
他也說了
He also mentioned that

570
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,440
根據密歇根上訴法庭的審判結果
the Michigan court of appeals decision

571
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,070
他可以違反那個條款
makes his contract breakable.

572
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,390
我讓律師查了  他說得沒錯
I had my lawyers look into it. He's right.

573
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,380
你讓你的律師
Did you also have your lawyers

574
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,660
調查侵犯知識產權了嗎
look into the theft of intellectual property?

575
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,700
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

576
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,070
我說的是喬納森發明的
I'm talking about the algorithm

577
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,490
鑒定一個公司
that Jonathan developed to identify

578
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,270
是否達到收購標準的算法
companies ripe for takeover.

579
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,310
-我的雇員  我的算法  -錯
- My employee, my algorithm.  - Wrong.

580
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,440
喬納森發明這個算法的時候
Jonathan developed it while under contract

581
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,480
還受雇于托尼·揚諾普洛斯  因此這個算法屬于后者
with Tony Gianopolous, which makes it his property.

582
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,050
-你想要什么  -什么都不要
- What do you want?  - I don't want anything.

583
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,850
我來這里
I just came down here

584
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,970
只是為了告訴你
to let you know you can go ahead

585
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,910
你和 喬納森·西德威爾怎么樣我不管
and do whatever you care to with Jonathan Sidwell,

586
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,830
但如果你用了他的算法
but if you use his algorithm,

587
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,820
我們會通過法律追討你因此所得的每分錢
we're gonna sue you for every penny that comes from it.

588
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,550
聽說你回來了
I heard you were back.

589
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,620
-你該這么動嗎  -處方寫的
- Should you be doing that?  - Prescribed.

590
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,660
慢走  得讓血液循環起來
Light walking. Need to get the blood flowing.

591
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,870
好
Okay.

592
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,690
很好
Good.

593
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,370
路易
Look, louis, I am--

594
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,870
你的事情我很遺憾  真心的
I'm sorry about what happened. I really am.

595
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,840
我會好起來的  瑞秋
Well, I'm gonna be fine, Rachel.

596
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,510
好
Good.

597
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,900
實際上我想和你討論一個合同問題
I actually wanted to talk to you about a contracts issue.

598
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,650
-開始  -好
- Shoot.  - Okay.

599
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,510
我的一個朋友  和一個公司代表
A friend of mine entered into a verbal agreement

600
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,840
達成了一個口頭契約  現在對方食言了
with an agent for a corporation, and now he's reneging on it.

601
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,280
等等  為什么口頭契約
Wait a second, why verbal?

602
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,430
為什么不
Why not?

603
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,140
口頭契約也收法律保護的  她知道
Verbal contracts are binding, and she knows it.

604
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,620
-錄音了嗎  -沒有
- She have it on tape?  - No.

605
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,420
那對方可以說謊  或者爭論字面問題
Well, then he can lie about it, or he can argue the wording.

606
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,000
不  對方做出了明確保證
No, he made a clear promise.

607
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,300
或許是不確定的承諾  承諾去試試
Well, maybe it was a promise to try,

608
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,710
-或許是個建議  -不是的
- or maybe it was a suggestion.  - No, it wasn't.

609
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,020
什么契約
What's the contract?

610
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,650
雇傭獎金
Employment bonus.

611
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,240
一次性支付  還是按期支付
Lump sum or payable over time?

612
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,600
-三年期限  -那口頭就屁用沒有了
- Three-year term.  - Well, then verbal ain't shit.

613
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,310
如果期限超過一年  就必須落筆
If it's paid over a year or more, it has to be written.

614
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,720
我朋友根據這個承諾  做了重大的決定
My friend made life decisions based on this promise.

615
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,850
她可以告對方  允諾禁反言 
She could sue for promissory estoppel.

616
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,490
如果允諾者做出允諾  被允諾者因此而行事
若允諾者食言  則需賠付相應損失

617
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,180
她可以告做出承諾的那個混蛋
Well, she could sue the dick who made the deal,

618
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,140
但沒法告公司
but she can't sue the company.

619
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,300
-她不想那么做  -我問問你
- She doesn't want to do that.  - Let me ask you this.

620
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,480
如果合法的話  為什么不落筆寫好
Why wouldn't she get it in writing if it was legit?

621
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,350
因為她信任他
Because she trusted him.

622
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,150
她不知道為什么會被他欺騙
She doesn't know why he would lie to her.

623
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,650
他欺騙  因為他可以
He did because he could.

624
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,010
他想在那時那刻達成這個目的
He wanted what he wanted when he wanted it,

625
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,940
對他毫無損失
and it cost him nothing.

626
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,510
-明白嗎  -明白
- You know?  - Yeah.

627
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,740
-或許她應該去告他  -她可以試試
- Maybe she should go after him.  - She could try.

628
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,830
但從實際出發  她會輸  應該輸
But I mean, realistically, she'll lose, and she should,

629
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,780
因為愚蠢不應該被獎勵
because stupidity shouldn't be rewarded.

630
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,760
你來找我真是太好了  讓我回復了活力
So glad you came to see me. You really got my juices going.

631
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,820
讓我覺得回到這里很高興
Make me feel glad to be back.

632
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:51,920
-這太好了 未婚夫  -非常好  未婚妻
- This is nice, fiance.  - It is nice, betrothed.

633
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,870
我們應該在哪兒開始呢
So where should we do it?

634
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,930
希拉  真的嗎  我剛經歷了心臟病發作
Sheila, are you serious? I just had a heart attack.

635
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,240
我說的是婚禮
I'm talking about the wedding.

636
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,540
我希望就在這兒舉行
I say we do it here.

637
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,400
在紐約結婚
Get married in New York?

638
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,030
這是我們開始的地方
It's where our relationship began.

639
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,500
我覺得在這里定終身最合適
I think it's only fitting that we tie the knot here.

640
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,910
我愛你
I love you.

641
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,360
好  那就定了
Good, then it's decided.

642
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,860
我們在這結婚
We'll do it here

643
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,840
然后直接搬去波士頓
and then move straight to Boston.

644
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,040
什么叫搬去波士頓啊
What do you mean move to Boston?

645
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,540
我不會搬的
I'm not moving to Boston.

646
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,390
你必須搬  你知道哈佛對我意味著什么
You have to. You know what Harvard means to me.

647
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,190
你也知道這家律所對我多重要
You know what Pearson Specter means to me.

648
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,660
路易  那里有很多律所
Okay, Louis, there are a dozen firms

649
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,740
會毫不猶豫地搶你
that would snap you up in a second there.

650
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,410
這里的法學院也是
Same goes for law schools here.

651
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,930
是  但都不是哈佛
Yeah, but they're not Harvard,

652
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,280
也就是說都是第二等的
which means they're second tier.

653
00:25:35,370 --> 00:26:35,370
人人影視
YYeTs.com

654
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,270
你真的以為我會放下一切
You seriously expected me to drop everything

655
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,620
搬到紐約來嗎
and move to New York?

656
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,100
是  我是這么想
Yeah, I did.

657
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,350
好吧  我覺得你也太自信了
Okay, well, I think that's a little presumptuous.

658
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,450
我嗎
Me?

659
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,180
那你呢
What about you?

660
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,080
你還建議我們搬去培根山呢
You're the one who has us buying a place on Bacon Hill.

661
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,660
首先  是燈塔山  我以為你喜歡那
Okay, it's "Beacon Hill," and I thought you liked it.

662
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,660
波士頓最好 最昂貴的街區

663
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,970
去旅游是挺好  不是生活
To visit. I mean, not to live.

664
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,660
你怎么能說這里的法學院是二等呢
And what are you talking about, our law schools are second tier?

665
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,830
波士頓才是二等呢
Your city is second tier.

666
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,300
也許我的城市是二等
Well, maybe my city is second tier.

667
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,180
可那是你嘴上說愛著的女人的家
But it's also the home of the woman you supposedly love.

668
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,790
希拉  別這樣
Oh, Sheila, come on, please.

669
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,250
我的一切都在紐約
I mean, everything I have is in New York.

670
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,360
是除了我的一切
Everything except me.

671
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,550
如果你雙眼盯著屏幕
It's usually easier if you look at the screen

672
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,440
會簡單點
with your eyes.

673
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,780
抱歉
I'm--I'm sorry.

674
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,140
這一周很不順
It's just been one of those weeks.

675
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,360
你知道路易會沒事的  對吧
You know Louis is gonna be okay, right?

676
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,040
是  我知道他沒事
Yeah, I know he's going to be okay.

677
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,240
但眼下這時  我恨他
But at the moment, I hate his guts.

678
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,260
我聽說你有喜事
I hear congratulations are in order.

679
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,600
杰西卡
Jessica.

680
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,280
又一個單身漢跳進婚姻的墳墓
Another eligible bachelor bites the dust.

681
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,320
是啊  不是  這事...
Yeah. I mean, no, it's--

682
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,940
很美好
It's amazing.

683
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,630
你感覺怎么樣
How are you feeling?

684
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,510
好多了  謝謝
Better, thanks.

685
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,390
我想給你個祝康復的小禮物
I wanted to get you a little welcome-back something.

686
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,750
不是貴重的東西
It's not much.

687
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,880
你這周真讓我嚇了一跳
You know, you gave me quite a scare this week.

688
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,960
我愛這照片
I love it.

689
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,920
是五年前的律師聚會
The Pearson Hardman retreat five years ago.

690
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,140
你知道那晚讓我記憶最深的是什么嗎
And do you know what I remember most about that night?

691
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,940
你跳舞跳得真好
What an amazing dancer you are.

692
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,270
在長島芭蕾學校學了五年
Five years, Long Island school of ballet.

693
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,000
你那晚可沒跳芭蕾
You weren't dancing ballet that night.

694
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,270
芭蕾是一切舞蹈的基礎
Well, they say ballet is the foundation for everything.

695
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,830
先生  你的基礎很好
Well, sir, you have an amazing foundation.

696
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,690
我就是覺得可以把這張加到你的收藏里
I just thought you could add that to your collection.

697
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,120
不要只有你和布魯諾
Somewhere between you and... Bruno.

698
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,730
你對我很重要
It means so much to me that you...

699
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,920
路易
Louis.

700
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,090
好了
Come on.

701
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,320
我們一起經歷了這么多
After everything we've been through,

702
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,800
你就是家人
you're family.

703
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,870
我的天
Holy shit.

704
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,830
可不是
I know.

705
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,310
他背叛了我
He betrayed me.

706
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,270
也許  可是瑞秋
Maybe, but, Rachel,

707
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,480
你都沒給他一個解釋的機會
you didn't even give him a chance to explain himself.

708
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,250
我不想讓他不安
I didn't want to upset him.

709
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,990
即便他當時騙了你
Even if he was bullshiting you back then,

710
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,110
我認識的路易是說到做到的
the Louis I know is a man of his word.

711
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,700
而如果你能直白地...
And if you went to him honestly--

712
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,030
那沒用的
It wouldn't matter.

713
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,840
他只會說他同意
He would just say he agreed to it,

714
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,150
但杰西卡還是會反對
and Jessica would still say no.

715
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,410
他可能會主動幫你付的
He might offer to pay.

716
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,090
當然不行  我不會允許的
Absolutely not. I wouldn't let him.

717
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,520
而你知道嗎  這不是問題所在
And you know what, that's not the problem.

718
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,310
問題是什么
What is the problem?

719
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,970
問題在于他讓我成了個傻子
The problem is he made me a chump.

720
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:43,570
瑞秋
Rachel--

721
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,080
唐娜  我以一個
Donna, I went in there

722
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,190
律師助理的身份與路易·利特協商
as a paralegal trying to negotiate with Louis Litt,

723
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,380
拿到了足夠讓我成為律師的錢
and I left with the money to become a lawyer,

724
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,940
這是我人生中第一次覺得
and for the first time in my life,

725
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,870
我真的能成為一名律師
I felt like I could actually be one.

726
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,670
而現在我意識到
And now I realize that...

727
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,030
當我離開的時候
when I left that room,

728
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:04,380
他大概在笑他是怎么占了我便宜的
he was probably laughing about how he pulled one over on me.

729
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,440
也許你說得沒錯
Maybe you're right.

730
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,200
但我告訴你  今天的路易絕不會這樣做
But I'm telling you, the Louis of today would never do that.

731
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,660
那今天的瑞秋也不可能
Well, the Rachel of today certainly wouldn't

732
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,780
就這么放過他
let him get away with it.

733
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,600
而今天的唐娜是個天才
And the Donna of today is a genius.

734
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,120
不  唐娜哪天不是天才嘛
Well, the genius of Donna is every day.

735
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,900
你想說什么
What are you saying?

736
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,790
你只是不能找路易麻煩
Just because you can't go after Louis

737
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,160
并不代表你不能拿到錢
doesn't mean you can't still make your case.

738
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,880
你是有什么毛病
What the hell is wrong with you?

739
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,010
你給我地圖讓我逃跑
You gave me the map to escape

740
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,270
又告訴守衛我在哪
and told the guards where I'd be.

741
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,990
-喬納森  -科瓦克撤銷了委托
- Jonathan-- - Kovacs rescinded his offer.

742
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,150
他說我沒有那套算法就不值錢了
He said I'm not worth it without that algorithm.

743
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,460
-聽著  我很抱歉  -抱歉
- Listen, I'm sorry. - Sorry?

744
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,480
是你先給我那個建議的
You gave me that advice in the first place.

745
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,060
那是因為你威脅你要炒掉路易
Because you threatened to leave Louis.

746
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,220
胡扯
Bullsh--.

747
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,130
你這樣做是因為你知道我在和誰作對
You did it because you knew what I was up against,

748
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,140
而你想幫我
and you were trying to help me.

749
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,580
不管是為了什么
Whether that's true or not,

750
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,260
那個建議都是私下的
that advice was off the record,

751
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,170
而現實中我的工作是阻止你
and it turns out that on the record it's my job to stop you.

752
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,200
呵呵  恭喜
Well, congratulations.

753
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,240
你剝奪了我最珍視的東西
You ripped away the thing I value the most.

754
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,960
那套算法  我花了十年開發
that algorithm-- it took me ten years to develop it.

755
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,300
那是我評估公司的方法
It's how I look at valuing companies.

756
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,030
是我評價世界的方法
It's how I look at the world.

757
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,710
如果我沒有了它
If I can't take it with me,

758
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,060
即使別人認為我有價值  我還是一文不值
even if someone thinks I'm worth something, I'm not.

759
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,510
-喬納森  -求你了
- Jonathan-- - Please.

760
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,430
臺面上的事你已經做過了
You did your job on the record.

761
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:12,510
私下里你告訴我  我該怎么辦
Now off the record, what do I do?

762
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,090
我的工作就是確保你無計可施
It was my job to make sure there's nothing you could do.

763
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,360
那這十年里你盡管看著
Then check in with me in ten years.

764
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,120
我只能在不變的職位上
'Cause I promise you I'll be at the same desk

765
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,730
上相同的班
punching the same clock.

766
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,150
不能升職  也不能離開
Can't move up, can't move out.

767
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,440
拜你所賜
It's on you.

768
00:30:35,370 --> 00:31:35,370
人人影視
YYeTs.com

769
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,220
你是對的
You were right.

770
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,850
這不是威廉·貝克和喬納森·西德威爾的問題
This isn't about William Beck or Jonathan Sidwell.

771
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,870
是我的問題
It's about me.

772
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,120
邁克
Mike--

773
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,470
我想讓自己合法化
I want to go legit.

774
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,180
你不能
You can't.

775
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,370
哈維  聽著
Harvey, listen--

776
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,750
我說得不夠清楚嗎
Do I need to state the obvious?

777
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,130
我現在可以去讀法學院  拿到真正的文憑
I can go to law school now, all right? Get a real degree.

778
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,310
即使你之前
Even if it didn't matter

779
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,620
假裝拿到了哈佛法學院文憑的事
that you've already presented yourself

780
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,810
無人追究
as having gone to Harvard Law,

781
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,900
你還要再考一次律師資格考試
you'd have to take the bar again.

782
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,410
我過了一次  第二次也會過的
Okay, I passed it once, I'll pass it again.

783
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,630
第一次不是以你自己的名字考的
Not under your own name.

784
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,180
而且如果你現在去考
And if you take it now,

785
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,220
許多人都會注意到你
you'll draw attention to yourself in a major way.

786
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,170
那我找羅拉·詹森黑進資格考名單
Then I get Lola Jensen to hack into the bar

787
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,080
把我名字加進去  就像她黑哈佛一樣
and just put me in there, just like she did with Harvard.

788
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,940
你瘋了嗎
Are you insane?

789
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,840
黑資格考的話你就是
Hacking into the bar is twice the crime

790
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,780
第二次違法了
you've been committing.

791
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,340
不想被人抓到辮子
Rule number one of not getting caught,

792
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,900
就是別輕舉妄動
you don't move the goddamn body.

793
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,040
但要被人發現的話就不一樣了
You do if they're about to find it.

794
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,280
沒人會發現的
They're not about to find it.

795
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,950
隨時會被發現
They're always about to find it!

796
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,320
邁克  用一個謊話來圓另一個謊話
Mike, committing another fraud to cover your fraud

797
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,740
是不能讓你合法化的
isn't going legit.

798
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,800
這只是掩蓋而已  并不能否認
It's just covering your ass, and it doesn't undo

799
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,520
你犯過法的事實
the fact that you've already committed the crime.

800
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,780
你以為我沒想過這些嗎
You think I haven't thought about all of this?

801
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,570
哈維  我無路可走了
Harvey, I'm stuck.

802
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,100
進也不是  退也不是
There's no way up, there's no way down.

803
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,650
我不能這樣過一輩子
I can't live my whole life like this.

804
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,940
好吧
Okay.

805
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,870
你想合法化
You want to be legit,

806
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,630
只有一個辦法
there's only one way.

807
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,320
你去找個愛荷華的小鎮
You go to a small town in Iowa

808
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,530
那里沒人知道哈維·斯佩克特
where nobody's ever heard of Harvey Specter,

809
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,600
杰西卡·皮爾遜和其他人
Jessica Pearson, or anybody else.

810
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,120
你去讀法學院  開個小公司
You go to law school, hang out your shingle.

811
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,540
沒人會知道
Nobody will ever know.

812
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,710
我保證你會在那小角落稱王
I guarantee you'd be king of the hill.

813
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,050
但你永遠不能回到大地方
But you could never come back to the mountain.

814
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,740
不能回來紐約  芝加哥  或洛杉磯
Not here in New York, Chicago, or L.A.

815
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,330
人多嘴雜  人們總會知道
Someone will know someone,

816
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,250
就前功盡棄了
and it'll all be for nothing.

817
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,270
我不能  你明知道的
I can't do that, and you know it.

818
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,330
我知道
I do know it.

819
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,080
邁克  你現在在律政之都
Mike, you're in the major leagues,

820
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,750
你可以面對面和最好的高手過招
and you get to go toe-to-toe with the best there is.

821
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,640
我不敢說這對你是不是這輩子值了
And I can't tell you if that's enough for a lifetime,

822
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,170
但如果你想留下  你就別無他法
but if you want to stay, there's nothing more you can do.

823
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,210
我的建議就是抓緊時間享受
My advice is hold on tight and enjoy the ride.

824
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,790
你來干嘛
What are you doing here?

825
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,660
我來幫你的
I'm here to help you.

826
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,840
你說過沒辦法阻止你做過的事
You said there was no way to stop what you did.

827
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,970
法律途徑不行  交易可行
This isn't a legal solution. It's a business solution.

828
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,630
一場眾人皆贏的交易
One where everybody wins.

829
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,760
眾人皆贏
Everybody wins?

830
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,950
這是你對貝克說過的話
That's what you said about Beck.

831
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,790
所以你要我也去開自己的公司
So you want me to spin off my own company,

832
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,350
我運營  他控股
I run it, he owns it?

833
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,890
我可沒那么說
I never said that.

834
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,810
好吧  他不和貝克一起合作
Well, he didn't go for it with Beck.

835
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,310
怎么會同意跟我呢
Why would he go for it with me?

836
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,110
因為他根本不屑于威廉·貝克
Because he doesn't give a sh-- about William Beck.

837
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,080
你說什么
What are you saying?

838
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,210
你每天都在開發你的算法
You develop your algorithm every day.

839
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:33,850
當然了
Of course.

840
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,670
不然的話算法就無效了
It's useless if I don't.

841
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,940
對  但這并不是你這樣做的原因
Right, but that's not why you do it.

842
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,300
你這樣做是因為你熱愛它
You do it because you love it.

843
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,510
好吧  他可以強迫我留下
Well, he can force me to stay,

844
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,750
但他不能逼我愛上它
but he can't force me to love it.

845
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,100
而這就是你的籌碼
And that's exactly where your leverage is.

846
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,830
如果你不熱愛你的工作  就會讓他錢財有損
If you don't love what you do, it costs him a fortune.

847
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,110
而他知道這一點
And he knows it.

848
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,990
那可不一定
This isn't a sure thing.

849
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,390
所以我相信如果不管用
Which is why I'm trusting he won't know

850
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,320
他也不會知道是我的建議
it came from me if it doesn't work.

851
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,380
你為什么要這么做
Why are you doing this?

852
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,680
就當我是熱愛我的工作吧
Let's just say I love my job...

853
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,510
但我知道被困住是什么感覺
But I know what it feels like to be trapped.

854
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,300
唐娜說你想見我
Donna said you wanted to see me

855
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,790
因為一些管理上的破事
about some more managerial bullshit.

856
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,720
什么
What?

857
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,650
你不覺得我已經吸取了支票的教訓了嗎
Don't you think I learned my lesson with the checks?

858
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,480
-那你找我干嘛  -你是來聽我說話的
- Then why am I here? - You're here to listen to me.

859
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,120
你知道這是要做什么嗎
Do you know what this is about?

860
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,540
知道  而且我已經告訴過你
Yes. And I already told you--

861
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,150
我來這不是為了要求你接受路易的合同
I am not here to ask you to honor Louis' contract.

862
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,840
我是來讓你給我一個新合同
I am here to ask you to make a new one with me.

863
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,040
我們跟你的合同
Our contract with you

864
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,970
是在你畢業后為你提供一份工作
is a promise of a job when you get out,

865
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,320
不是給你交學費
Not paying for you on your way in.

866
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,090
我手里的名單上有
I have a list here of the signing bonuses

867
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,330
這里三個律師簽約時許諾的獎金
of the top three associates who have come into this firm.

868
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,700
把我的獎金預支給我
Give me an advance on mine.

869
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,320
上次我們談判的時候  你說
The last time we negotiated, you said,

870
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,290
如果得不到回報就不要簽任何東西
"Never sign something without getting something in return."

871
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,740
你得到的回報就是
What you're getting in return

872
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,260
我繼續在這里兼職工作
is that I keep working here part-time.

873
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,320
預支的獎金加上我的薪水就夠我的學費了
The advance, plus my salary, will cover my tuition.

874
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,360
助理掙不了那么多
Paralegals don't make that much.

875
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,780
那些錢加起來也不夠
Those numbers don't add up.

876
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,740
我不是說我要當助理
I'm not proposing being a paralegal.

877
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,920
初級律師那樣的工作
Some of the associates work as lawyers,

878
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,630
我也可以
and I can do the same.

879
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,680
你想得還真快
You came up with that pretty fast.

880
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,940
就像是你想讓我
It's almost as if you wanted me

881
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,830
問你我能得到什么回報一樣
to ask you what I get in return.

882
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,390
-成交嗎  -有個問題
- Do we have a deal? - One problem.

883
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,490
你已經讓我破例了一次了
You already asked me to break precedent once

884
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,690
我放棄了非哈佛不要的規矩
when I waived the Harvard rule.

885
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,580
我不會再為交學費而破例
I'm not breaking it again to pay for law school.

886
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,320
我沒有讓你打破任何規矩
I'm not asking you to break anything.

887
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:30,150
你已經有過先例了  就是他
You already established precedence, with him.

888
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,830
在你為他交學費的時候
