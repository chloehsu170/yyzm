这看起来不错嘛
Hey, it's looking good.

16
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,240
-你应该有好消息吧  -没错
- Tell me you got good news. - I do.

17
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,780
安厦建筑公司的过渡贷款通过审批了

18
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,370
哈维在银行托了些关系

哈维  很高兴见到你
Good to see you, Harvey.

20
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,570
我发现你有点排斥体力劳动啊
I figured you was allergic to manual labor.

21
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,160
露西尔  必要时我还是会干点脏活的
I'll get my hands dirty if I have to, Lucille.

22
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,210
但我相信齐家才能治国
But I believe charity begins at home.

23
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,130
是啊  从你戴的劳力士手表
Yeah, and based on that Rolex you wear,

24
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,470
我就看出你所爱的事业正蒸蒸日上
I'd say that your favorite cause is doing pretty good.

25
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,550
你需要在这签个字
We're gonna need your signature here.

26
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,290
15%的利息
15% interest?

27
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,420
他们担心安厦建筑公司的偿付能力
They're worried about Stable Shelters' solvency.

28
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,300
他们还担心
They're worried?

29
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,080
他们应该去做执行董事
They should try being executive director.

30
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,520
如果你追不回
If you don't recover the money

31
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,620
安东尼・马兹洛从我们这里挪用的资金
that Anthony Mazlo embezzled from us,

32
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,550
这些计划就都泡汤了
every one of these projects goes dark.

33
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,200
除非你的公寓
Unless you got a spare room or two

34
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,370
有地方收留几千户家庭
for a couple thousand families in your condo.

35
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,240
我不太喜欢跟别人合住
I'm not really a roommate kind of guy.

36
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,740
今天下午哈维就会听取马兹洛的副手
Harvey's deposing Elliot Perkins, Mazlo's number two,

37
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,640
埃利奥特・珀金斯的证词
this afternoon.

38
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,390
珀金斯一定清楚这点
Perkins had to have knowledge of this,

39
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,690
他会供出他的老板的
and he's going to give up his boss.

40
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,230
我向你保证  稍等
That's a promise. Excuse me.

41
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,620
看看  去希腊旅游时
Check it out. Mazlo spent $500

42
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,670
马兹洛有一晚在宠物日托所花了五百美元
a night on doggie daycare on his trip to Greece.

43
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,610
希腊
Greece.

44
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,130
怎么了
What?

45
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,630
-没事  -说
- Oh, nothing. - Tell me.

46
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,820
我的第一次就是在希腊
My first time was in greece.

47
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,020
天呐  你在想象当时的情景  是吧
My god, you're picturing that right now, aren't you?

48
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,320
没办法  我是视觉动物
I have no choice. I'm a visual person.

49
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,530
你们俩真可爱
You two are really adorable.

50
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,780
还有两天就要庭审了
We're 48 hours from trial,

51
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,130
你们还像参加野营的孩子一样闲聊
and you're gossiping like two 12-year-olds at sleepaway camp.

52
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,080
听好了
Listen up.

53
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,760
露西尔・杰克森不只是安厦建筑公司的头儿  
Lucille Jackson's not just the head of Stable Shelters, okay?

54
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,620
她还是我们律所
She also sits on the board of directors

55
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,410
好几个大客户的董事会成员
of several of our largest clients.

56
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,450
因此如果我们输了
So if we lose this case,

57
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,980
我觉得她不会对我们手软的
I doubt that her generosity's going to extend to us.

58
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,220
-我会...  -来我办公室
- I would-- - In my office.

59
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,220
带上清泉钻井公司的上市资料
Bring the Clarity Drilling IPO.

60
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,990
杰罗姆・詹森来了  快点
Jerome Jensen's here. Come on.

61
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,450
我们得全力攻克露西尔的案子  哈维
Lucille's case is all hands on deck, Harvey.

62
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,170
你不可以就这么...
You can't just--

63
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,560
我可以  你奈我何
I can, and I am.

64
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,980
我们难道不是在合作吗
I thought we're working on this together.

65
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,040
路易  我们是在合作
Yeah, we are, Louis.

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,810
就像高尔夫球手和球僮一样
Same way a golfer and his caddy work together.

67
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,190
尽管如此
Be that as it may,

68
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,600
我们要在15分钟后向埃利奥特・珀金斯取证  所以...
We are deposing Elliot Perkins in 15 minutes, so--

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,780
珀金斯的事可以等等
Perkins can wait.

70
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,540
你只要事先把9号杆给我好好擦亮就行了
Just make sure that my 9 iron is nice and shiny when I get there.

71
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,730
好吗  来吧  迈克
Okay? Come on, Mike.

72
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,870
哈维
Harvey.

73
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,380
杰罗姆・詹森  这位是迈克・罗斯
Jerome Jensen, meet Mike Ross.

74
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,550
他有首次公开募股的最新信息
He's got the latest on the IPO.

75
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,890
-你好  迈克  -詹森先生
- Hello, Mike. - Mr. Jensen.

76
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,360
我不是来谈生意的  哈维
I'm not here to talk about my business, Harvey.

77
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,660
我女儿貌似惹上麻烦了
Looks like my daughter might be getting into some trouble.

78
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,550
米德里德・维纽斯基
Mildred Wisnewski.

79
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,700
罗拉用假身份证干什么
What's Lola doing with a fake I.D.?

80
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,030
这就是我想让你们调查的
Well, that's what I hope you can find out.

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,240
这是她在朋友的成人礼上点饮料的时候
It slipped out of her purse when she was ordering a drink

82
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,130
从包里掉出来的
at a friend's bar mitzvah.

83
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,640
有什么头绪吗
Any idea what it's about?

84
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,310
我和罗拉这几年闹得挺僵的
My relationship with Lola's been rocky for a few years.

85
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,260
我问她什么  她都不说实话
If I asked her, she'd just lie.

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,300
其实  知不知道无所谓
Truth is, I don't need to know.

87
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,810
我只想请你帮我解决这事
I just need you to take care of it.

88
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,770
谢谢你
Thank you.

89
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,990
哈维在搞什么鬼
What the hell is Harvey doing?

90
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,790
他应该去对埃利奥特・珀金斯取证
He's supposed to be deposing Elliot Perkins.

91
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,710
他跟客户在一起
He's with a client.

92
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,940
我不管  我们要取证
I don't care. We have a deposition.

93
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,010
别乱来  路易
Don't even try it, Louis.

94
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,040
抱歉
I'm sorry.

95
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,190
咱们从头聊  好吗
Let's--let's just start over. Okay?

96
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,110
-你好  唐娜  -你好
- Hi, Donna. - Hi.

97
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,040
你知道我喜欢你的  对吧
You know I like you, right?

98
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,920
但是在公司的食物链中
But in the firm's food chain,

99
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,350
我是座头鲸  而你只是浮游生物
I am a humpback whale, and you are phytoplankton.

100
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,320
1997年6月3日
June 3, 1997.

101
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,840
这对我不是什么特殊的日子
that date means nothing to me.

102
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,900
真的吗
Doesn't it?

103
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,780
谁告诉你的
Who told you?

104
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,960
重要的不是我怎么知道的
Is the important thing how I know

105
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,690
而是我知道了
or that I know?

106
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,900
哈维知道吗
Does Harvey know?

107
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,240
有可能
He can.

108
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,600
我可以给你钱
I'm going to pay you.

109
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,470
只是我现在没带现金
I just don't have cash on me right now.

110
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,820
不过我会让诺玛到取款机去取
So I'm gonna just tell Norma to run her old ass out to the ATM

111
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,540
然后立刻送来  好吗
and then bring it back in a jiff, all right?

112
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,680
我不要你的钱  路易
I don't want your money, Louis.

113
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,680
我只想让你...
I just want you to--

114
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,990
无视我吧  就当我没来过
I was not here. I was not here.

115
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,330
我没来过
I was not here.

116
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,050
好了  我们开始吧
All right, let's get started, shall we?

117
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,300
不是由哈维・斯佩克特来主持取证吗
Isn't Harvey Specter leading this deposition?

118
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,370
他派我来了
He sent me.

119
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,760
珀金斯先生
Now, Mr. Perkins,

120
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,930
我的第一个问题是
my first question to you is...

121
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,920
你晚上睡得好吗
do you sleep well at night?

122
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,030
当然好了
of course you do,

123
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,740
因为你有房子住  有自来水用
'cause you have a roof and a bed and running water,

124
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,960
相比之下
and by contrast,

125
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,850
上千户的家庭即将露宿街头
thousands of families are gonna be sleeping on the street

126
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,700
就因为你偷了公司的钱
when Stable Shelters is forced to suspend their operations,

127
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,180
致使安厦建筑公司的运作搁浅
all because of the money that you stole.

128
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,340
我从没偷过任何东西
I never stole anything.

129
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,770
你是马兹洛的副手
You're Mazlo's number two.

130
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,640
你不承认有人挪用公款吗
Money was embezzled. Do you deny that?

131
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,050
-当然不承认  -拜托  罗伯特
- Absolutely. - Please, Robert,

132
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,310
我知道你这个总顾问只做些琐碎的事
I know as general counsel you just basically push paper,

133
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,660
但请你警告珀金斯先生
But will you please warn Mr. Perkins

134
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,840
作伪证的后果
about the penalties of perjury.

135
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,660
我没听到什么伪证
Look, I'm not aware of any perjury.

136
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,400
我们知道你在开曼群岛有个账户
We know about your account in the Caymans.

137
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,340
-两千万美元  -别搞笑了
- $20 million. - Are you kidding me?

138
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,260
那笔交易是合法的
That transaction was legitimate.

139
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,970
等我把这个公诸于众  你就得颜面扫地
Oh, when I take this public, you're gonna be disgraced.

140
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,460
你的妻子  孩子  全家都要颜面扫地
Your wife, your children, your whole family, disgraced.

141
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,490
请你尊重我的委托人
Would you show my client some respect--

142
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,540
而且那笔交易和公司没有任何关系
and that transaction had nothing to do with the firm.

143
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,540
扯淡
Bullshit.

144
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,260
那笔钱不是马兹洛给你的赃款  就是封口费
You either took your cut from Mazlo, or it was hush money.

145
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,750
不管怎样  除非供出马兹洛
Either way, you're gonna live the rest of your life

146
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,180
不然你下半辈子都只能做个下等人了
as a pariah, or you give up Mazlo now.

147
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,780
这是在取证还是审讯
Is this a deposition or an inquisition?

148
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,990
真是荒谬  我可以把记录给你看
This is ridiculous. I can show you the records.

149
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,820
你当然可以  因为就是你
Oh, sure you can. Because you're the guy

150
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,000
捏造了按揭证券的亏损
who invented losses in mortgage-backed securities

151
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,910
其实你根本就没买
when you never even bought them.

152
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,380
这没我的份
I had no part in that.

153
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,730
但是你很清楚这件事  却没有阻拦
But you were aware of it, and you did nothing about it.

154
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,930
够了  路易
Come on, Louis.

155
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,710
我可以喝杯水吗
Can I get a glass of water, please?

156
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,090
不可以  我们这里没水
You can't get any water. We don't have any.

157
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,330
只要你供出马兹洛  就不用受这份罪了
You give up Mazlo now, and this all stops.

158
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,440
好了  这样吧
All right, that's-- that's it.

159
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,630
我的委托人需要休息一下
My client needs a break.

160
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,110
我们十分钟后再继续
We can continue this in ten minutes.

161
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,460
我才刚刚开始
I'm just getting started.

162
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,120
我不明白了  她看起来很可爱
I don't get it. She looks so sweet.

163
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,600
别被照片蒙了
Don't let the photo fool you.

164
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,950
她可不是邻家女孩
She's less "girl next door"

165
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,990
更像是个不良少女
and more "girl with the dragon tattoo."

166
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,990
安厦建筑公司的案子让我无暇他顾
Look, my plate's full with Stable Shelters.

167
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,040
我要你去调查杰罗姆的女儿
I need you to look into Jerome's daughter.

168
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,960
你怎么不请个私家侦探
Why didn't you just hire a private investigator?

169
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
因为一旦出现问题
Because if there's a problem,

170
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,200
侦探解决不了
an investigator can't fix it.

171
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,270
我不只是杰罗姆的律师
I'm not just a lawyer to Jerome, okay?

172
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,800
我就像电影《教父》里的罗伯特・杜瓦尔
I'm--I'm more like Robert Duvall in the Godfather.

173
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,800
罗伯特・杜瓦尔:教父的养子  职业为律师

174
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,310
是他的顾问
His consigliere.

175
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,110
好吧
Okay.

176
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,600
怎么了
What?

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,870
没什么
Uh, nothing.

178
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,360
就是如果你是他的罗伯特・杜瓦尔
Just if you're his Robert Duvall,

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,170
你转而拜托我
you're coming to me,

180
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,640
所以严格来讲  我就是你的罗伯特・杜瓦尔
so technically i'm your Robert Duvall.

181
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,100
你是我的弗雷多
You're my Fredo.

182
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,100
弗雷多:教父的次子  最终被弟弟麦克所杀

183
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,310
弗雷多  不是
Fredo? No.

184
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,980
罗伯特  珀金斯怎么了
Robert, what the hell happened to Perkins?

185
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,020
问问你那凶狠的同事吧
Ask that pit bull of yours.

186
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,010
不  实际上
No, actually.

187
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,710
我更喜欢女按摩师
I prefer a female masseuse?

188
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,610
如果...  我一会打给你好吗
If that-- can I call you right back?

189
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,280
一会就好  好的  再见
Right back. Okay, bye.

190
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,600
珀金斯刚才被抬上担架
Perkins just got wheeled out on stretcher.

191
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,830
他是中暑了吧
Well, he couldn't handle the heat.

192
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,720
说不定是假装的
He's probably faking it.

193
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,080
你脑子在想什么  我还没来就开始取证
What were you thinking, starting that deposition without me?

194
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,240
我怎么知道  也许你正忙着...
I don't know. Maybe if you were doing your jo--

195
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,500
-不  -怎么了
- Oh, no. - What?

196
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,110
盖勒发来消息  珀金斯没有装病
It's from Geller. Perkins wasn't faking anything.

197
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,250
我们断送了安东尼・马兹洛的性命
Our best chance to nail Anthony Mazlo's dead.

198
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,590
他不愿配合取证
Well, he blew off the deposition,

199
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,200
我只是想让他知道我们不是好惹的
so I was just picking up the slack.

200
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,260
我是想让珀金斯不安
I was letting Perkins sweat.

201
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,530
这是我的策略  但全让你搞砸了
It was a tactic, which you completely undermined.

202
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,200
他被我整得远远不是焦躁这么简单了
I believe I made him sweat and then some.

203
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,920
你对自己的所作所为很骄傲吗
Are you actually proud of what you did?

204
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,190
就我个人而言
As far as I'm concerned,

205
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,410
无论那家伙发生了什么事
whatever happened to that guy

206
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,010
都是他咎由自取
was a result of his own guilt,

207
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,490
我也不会因为向他这个罪犯取证
and I will not apologize for deposing a criminal

208
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,690
而诚恳道歉的
in a vigorous manner.

209
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,350
珀金斯的死  让案件变得棘手
Losing Perkins is a complication.

210
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,700
我们得加倍努力
We're just gonna have to work harder

211
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,640
追查出马兹洛的资金下落
to unearth Mazlo's money trail.

212
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,220
就目前的情况
As for what happened,

213
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,840
我已经和医院交涉过了
I've spoken to the hospital,

214
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,600
死因是肺栓塞
and cause of death was a pulmonary embolism.

215
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,580
跟你没有任何关系
It was nothing you did.

216
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,300
那这功劳能算我的吗
Would it be okay if I took the credit?

217
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,990
路易  我要和哈维单独说两句
Louis, I need to have a word with Harvey.

218
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,870
好吧
Okay.

219
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,150
金融犯罪案是那家伙的专长
Financial crime is that man's forte.

220
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,120
我承认  他越权了
Yes, he overstepped his rank,

221
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,300
但我不打算玉石俱焚
but I'm not about to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

222
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,460
路易就是那块"石头"
Louis is the bathwater.

223
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,860
信不信由你  哈维
Believe it or not, harvey,

224
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,010
跟你合作可不是件容易事
You can be a real pain in the ass to work with too.

225
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,750
我觉得我很好相处啊
I get along with me just fine.

226
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,970
我不打算告诉露西尔・杰克森
Yes, well, I'm not about to tell Lucille Jackson

227
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,650
我们打不赢这场官司是由于我们合不来
that we didn't win because we couldn't work together.

228
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,950
你得适应和路易一起工作
You need to figure out how to collaborate with Louis.

229
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,130
罗拉・詹森假身份证上的名字
So the name on Lola Lensen's fake I.D.

230
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,660
并不是她凭空捏造的
wasn't just pulled from thin air.

231
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,400
而是清泉钻井公司的一名财务总监助理
Belongs to an assistant controller at Clarity Drilling.

232
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,940
跟我说这些干嘛
You're telling me this why?

233
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,700
不是你让我查的吗
You wanted me to look into it.

234
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,070
我没让你解释问题所在
I didn't ask you to explain the problem to me.

235
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,510
而是要你解决问题
I asked you to fix it for me.

236
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,080
路易真的杀人了吗
Did Louis really kill a guy?

237
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,850
这是你们助理之间传出的闲话吗
Is that what the associate rumor mill's been churning out?

238
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,610
实际上  我觉得是他挑的头
Actually, I think he started it.

239
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,960
他还声称自己1米88
He also claims that he's 6'2"

240
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,700
满头秀发
with a full head of hair.

241
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,440
满头秀发的路易  真有他的
Louis with hair. That's good.

242
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,700
你是怎么过唐娜那一关的
How'd you get past Donna?

243
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,800
你是趁她上厕所的时候进来的吧
You waited till she peed, didn't you?

244
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,400
那女人的憋尿功力了得
I mean, the woman retains water like a camel.

245
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,060
我发现
I see that the, uh,

246
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,010
你没有史上最伟大乐队的唱片
greatest band of all time is conspicuously absent.

247
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,790
你指的是哪个乐队  路易
And who would that be, Louis?

248
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,110
一个叫皇后的英国小乐队
I don't know. A little British band called Queen?

249
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,210
我早该料到你会这么说
Should have seen that coming.

250
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,480
真正的音乐家
You know, real musicians,

251
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,810
是不画眼线的
they don't wear eyeliner.

252
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,940
是吗  你怎么不去跟
Really? Why don't you tell that

253
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,640
摇滚歌手"王子"说说呢
to the artist formerly known as Prince,

254
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,610
他的本名就叫普林斯[王子]
Who's... once again named Prince?

255
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,330
你想干嘛  路易
What do you want, Louis?

256
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,950
既然我们一起工作
I think now that we're working together,

257
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,180
就得制定一些基本原则
we should set some ground rules.

258
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,580
原则一  永远别碰我的唱片
First rule, never touch my records.

259
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,730
以及这个办公室里的任何东西
or anything else in this office.

260
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,260
好吧
Fine.

261
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,800
包括这里的家具
That includes the furniture.

262
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,740
我想和你和睦相处
I'm trying to build a rapport with you.

263
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,280
好吗
Okay?

264
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,860
我们的关系还需要慢慢磨合
I mean, I think our relationship needs a little work.

265
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,370
等我们五周年结婚纪念的时候
Let's hold off the couples counseling

266
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,810
再考虑婚姻咨询吧
Until our fifth anniversary.

267
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,900
你觉得怎么样
Don't you think?

268
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,560
听着  马兹洛的律师加速了案件审理的进度
Look, Mazlo's lawyer moved to push up the trial.

269
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,820
他们知道我们需要时间寻找其他证人
They know we need time to cultivate another witness.

270
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,180
那我们就忽悠他们
I say we bluff.

271
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,890
我可以说  珀金斯的律师一走出房门
I mean, Perkins implicated Mazlo

272
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,570
就向马兹洛做出了暗示
the minute his lawyer walked out of the room.

273
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,940
那是瞎说  路易
That's hearsay, Louis.

274
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,540
如果这算临终忏悔的话就不一样了
Not if it's a deathbed confession.

275
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,260
我们还可以说  盖勒打报警电话的时候
Maybe while Geller was making the 911 call,

276
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,490
我和珀金斯说了几句话
I had a little conversation with Perkins.

277
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,770
对于珀金斯没说过的话和没做过的事
So you want to lie about what Perkins said

278
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,490
你打算瞎编吗
and how he said it?

279
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,010
那你有什么高见  哈维
What's your brilliant solution, Harvey?

280
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,810
根据之前说好的  
I'm having the money

281
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,360
我准备查出珀金斯那笔钱的下落
in Perkins' account traced as we speak,

282
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,850
我也想到其他证人的人选了
and I have another witness in mind.

283
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,470
如果我能和安东尼・马兹洛当面对质
I get Anthony Mazlo across that table,

284
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,250
我一定能降服他
You know I'll break him.

285
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,330
就像你降服珀金斯那样吗
The way you broke Perkins?

286
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,420
对  如果有必要的话
Yeah. If need be.

287
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
你没明白我的意思
You're not hearing me.

288
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,970
我们现在最好不要安排任何会面
We need to hold off on any meeting.

289
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,080
-我只是想知道...  -就这么决定了  路易
- I just wanna know why-- - That's final, Louis.

290
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,830
提问  一个叫罗拉・詹森的人为什么
Question. Why would someone named Lola Jensen

291
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,610
想让别人误以为她是米德里德・维纽斯基
ever want to be known as Mildred Wisnewski?

292
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,610
你是谁
Who are you?

293
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,090
我叫迈克・罗斯  是名律师
My name's Mike Ross. I'm a lawyer.

294
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,310
让我猜猜  皮尔逊・哈德曼律所的吗  
Let me guess. Pearson Hardman?

295
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,350
你知道吗  911事件后
You know, forging a government document

296
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,450
伪造政府批文的可能性微乎其微
like this after 911 is next to impossible.

297
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,620
天呐  二甲胺八成又出了点小问题
God, there must have been a glitch at the DMA.

298
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,210
你来这干什么
Why'd you come here?

299
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,080
你父亲来找过我们  他很担心你
Your father came to us 'cause he's worried about you.

300
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,390
他才不担心我  不然他就亲自过来了
He's not worried. He'd be here himself.

301
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,330
而不是派个无名小律师过来
He wouldn't have sent an empty suit.

302
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,400
你对我一无所知
You don't know anything about me.

303
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,230
而我却知道  你利用这张身份证
I, on the other hand, know that you used this I.D.

304
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,050
从清泉钻井公司窃取资金
to funnel payments from Clarity Drilling

305
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,440
注入你自己建立的冒名公司
to some fake company that you set up.

306
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,110
洛克斯利有限责任公司
Locksley LLC?

307
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,270
你在从父亲的公司窃取资金
You're stealing money from your father's company.

308
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,580
到目前为止  有200万了吧
Couple million so far.

309
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,960
我不需要知道原因
I don't need to know why,

310
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,950
但我要你立刻完璧归赵
but I do need you to return it. Now.

311
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,760
其实  你有必要知道原因
Actually, you do need to know why.

312
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
这是从突沙市南部
This is ground water

313
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,260
清泉公司那个天杀的工程中提取的地下水
from Clarity's fracking operation south of Tulsa.

314
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,370
亚乙基二醇二丁基  甲烷和苯的含量
It's got elevated levels of dibutoxyethanol,

315
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,850
严重超标
methane, and benzene.

316
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,550
这是钻井前水样的化学物质含量
This compares samples taken pre-drilling

317
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,790
和上周提取的对比图
to levels taken last week.

318
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,300
你怎么弄到的  那可是公司机密数据
How did you get that? That's classified company data.

319
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,100
你就当我是电脑高手吧
Let's just say I'm good with computers.

320
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,870
慢着  洛克斯利责任有限公司  
Wait a minute. Locksley llc.

321
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,580
名称取自《盗侠罗宾汉》和《罗宾汉》吧
As in Robin of Locksley, as in Robin Hood.

322
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,900
这些毒素会导致肾衰竭
These toxins are known to cause kidney failure,

323
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,580
肝癌和不孕不育
liver cancer, and infertility.

324
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,060
环保署就此只做出了轻度处罚
The EPA fines were a slap on the wrist,

325
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,630
但是你们律所与受害者所商定的赔偿数目
but the settlement that your firm negotiated with the victims--

326
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,020
无论你的动机有多单纯
It doesn't matter how pure your motives are.

327
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,920
你都犯下了重罪
You're committing a very serious crime.

328
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,590
你就使劲地威胁我吧
Threaten all you want. Okay?

329
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,560
在我父亲的公司上市之前
There's no way that my father's gonna let this go public

330
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,150
他不会将此公之于众
right before his IPO.

331
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,230
我是不会把钱还回去的
I'm not giving the money back.

332
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,250
我会分发给受害者
I'm giving it away.

333
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,440
关于健在的亲属  我没有找到任何线索
In terms of living relatives, I didn't find anything,

334
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,080
但当我调查过世亲属遗留下的房产时
but when I looked into the estates of relatives who passed away,

335
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,590
发现E控股公司最初是以阿姨的名义登记的
E Holding was originally in the name of the aunt.

336
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,730
你对于珀金斯的假设是正确的
Your theory on Perkins is right.

337
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,320
哈维  你在干什么
Harvey, what are you doing?

338
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,300
瑞秋应该为我做事的
Rachel's services are under my purview.

339
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,460
抱歉  我不会让他得逞的
Sorry. I'm gonna change that.

340
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,910
安东尼・马兹洛和他的律师在会议室
Anthony Mazlo and his attorney are in the conference room.

341
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,030
谁让他们来的
At whose invitation?

342
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,910
你认为是我打电话让他们来的吗
What, you think I called 'em?

343
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,210
不是我
I--I didn't.

344
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,410
那就是马兹洛觉得他占了上风
Then Mazlo feels he has an advantage.

345
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,500
现在想乘胜追击
And he's pressing it.

346
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,990
各位
Fellas.

347
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,880
谢谢你们能这么快赶来接待我们
Thanks for meeting us on such short notice.

348
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,320
我还以为你在飞机上呢  马兹洛先生
I figured you'd be on a flight right now, Mr. Mazlo.

349
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,560
飞到没有引渡协议的地方
Somewhere with no extradition agreement.

350
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,780
我们直接说重点吧
Let's get to the point.

351
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,010
珀金斯不在了  你们就无法立案
Without Perkins, you don't have a case.

352
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,250
这是我们内部调查的总结报告
This report summarizes an internal investigation we conducted.

353
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,450
伊内兹递给你们的
What Inez has just handed you

354
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,620
就是珀金斯进行虚假投资
is hard evidence of fraudulent investments

355
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,450
和谎报损失的铁证
and fake losses perpetrated by Perkins.

356
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,400
你们有妄想症吧
Guys have a real penchant for fiction, don't you?

357
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,650
没有  是他骗了我们大家
No, he duped all of us.

358
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,170
作为执行总裁  他不但背叛了我
As CEO, he betrayed me

359
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,760
还背叛了所有投资人
just as much as the investors.

360
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,500
我们发现了一个存有两千万的离岸账户
We found an offshore account worth 20 million.

361
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,250
等等
Hold on a second.

362
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,780
露西尔・杰克森让你们管理
Lucille Jackson trusts you to manage

363
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,770
一亿五千万的捐赠基金
a $150 million endowment.

364
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,820
珀金斯拿了两千万  那其余的钱呢
Perkins takes 20. Where the hell's the rest of it?

365
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,970
鉴于目前的发现
In light of these findings,

366
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,410
我们想要进行和解
we'd like to offer a settlement.

367
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,300
一千五百万
15 million.

368
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,480
只给九牛一毛  真是耻辱
Ten cents on the dollar? That's a slap in the face.

369
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,900
我们提醒客户们投资有风险
Well, we advise all our clients that investments carry risk.

370
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,150
想要零风险回报  就去买国库券
You want a risk-free return, buy treasury bills,

371
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,320
或者把钱藏在床垫下面
or, I don't know, hide your money under the mattress.

372
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,530
在你天马流星编故事的时候
While you were writing the great American novel,

373
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,640
我却一直在调查事实
I've been checking facts.

374
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,440
珀金斯在海外账户上的两千万是合法所得
The 20 million that Perkins had overseas was legitimate.

375
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,000
他是无辜的
He was innocent.

376
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,680
你们公司被挪用的钱还未追回
The money your firm embezzled is still out there,

377
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,590
而这份所谓的调查报告
and this so-called investigation

378
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,000
纯属浪费纸张
isn't worth the paper it's printed on.

379
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,270
露西尔・杰克森不会同意的  律师
Well, Lucille Jackson may beg to differ, counselor.

380
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,480
申请过渡贷款说明她走投无路了
A bridge loan means she's desperate.

381
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,510
我们的条件没有商量余地
Our offer is non-negotiable.

382
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,900
这个条件我今天不会接受  以后也不会
I won't accept this offer today or a year from now.

383
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,850
既然你们不请自来
Now since you've all invited yourselves over,

384
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,480
也请自觉离开吧
feel free to see yourselves out.

385
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,210
刚才我想对珀金斯的事撒谎  你还教训我
So first you attack me for wanting to lie about Perkins,

386
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,270
结果一扭头就撒了谎  真是自打嘴巴
and then you turn around, do the same exact thing?

387
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,720
我没说谎
I wasn't lying.

388
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,260
你说什么
What are you saying to me?

389
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,600
哈维  你到底在说什么
Harvey, what the hell are you saying to me?

390
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,090
珀金斯没有参与此事吗
That Perkins had no involvement whatsoever?

391
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,570
我就是此意  路易
That's exactly what I'm saying, Louis.

392
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,630
他是无辜的
He was innocent.

393
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,390
马兹洛对我们虚报低价也不奇怪
It's no surprise that Mazlo low-balled us.

394
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,900
我只是按规定传述条件
I'm just passing along this offer as a formality.

395
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,190
一千五百万不是什么小数目
$15 million is not insignificant.

396
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,720
但现在不是和解的时候
But now's not the time to settle.

397
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,560
我们必须坚持立场
We have to strengthen our hand.

398
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,400
好吧  我有个问题
All right, here's my problem.

399
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,530
最佳情况是
Best-case scenario.

400
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,180
我们上庭  陪审团判决和解
We go to trial, the jury awards us a settlement,

401
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,380
显然  马兹洛更希望如此
obviously Mazlo appeals that.

402
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,040
那样的话  我三年都别想拿到钱
It's three years before I see any money,

403
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,730
而到时我的基金早就没了
and my foundation's long gone by that point.

404
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,280
不  我不会让马兹洛
No, I'm not gonna let Mazlo

405
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,770
分走你捐赠基金的最大份额
pocket the lion's share of your endowment.

406
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,200
我可不想得不偿失
I'm not interested in a Pyrrhic victory.

407
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,300
我们也是
Neither are we.

408
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,560
为了表明诚意  我们打算先动用平日收费
And to prove it, we're gonna forego our usual fee,

409
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,840
并返还你已付的费用
and return to you the money you've already paid.

410
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,900
我从小睡在我妈的车里
I grew up sleeping in my mama's car.

411
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,010
我们住过的小客栈  数都数不过来
And in and out of more halfway houses than I can count,

412
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,530
我从中悟出的道理就是每一分钱都很宝贵
and one thing I realized is that every penny matters.

413
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,650
所以我要谢谢你们
So thank you.

414
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,440
你要怎么做
What you gonna do?

415
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,550
珀金斯也许是无辜的
Perkins may have been innocent,

416
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,310
但他还是马兹洛的直属部下
but he was still Mazlo's direct report.

417
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,660
我要弄清他知道些什么
I'm gonna find out what he knew.

418
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,750
你们的工作就是核查马兹洛
Your job is to verify every detail

419
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,590
内部调查的每一个细节
of Mazlo's internal investigation.

420
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,120
不是要查犯罪细节  而是他们所掩盖的事实
It is not about the crime now. It's about the cover-up.

421
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,720
这上面说珀金斯独来独往
This says Perkins acted alone.

422
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,880
他是个完美的替罪羊
Well, he's the perfect scapegoat.

423
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,080
他不能为自己辩护了
He can't defend himself.

424
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,410
你想去厕所吗
You want to go to the bathroom?

425
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,850
去了就别回来了
You don't bother coming back.

426
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,390
另外还不准打私人电话  发私人电邮和短信
By the way, that goes for personal phone calls, emails, and texts.

427
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,520
一旦发现有所懈怠
I detect a whiff of slacking,

428
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,470
你们就完了  明白了吗
you are done. Get it?

429
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,950
我在办公室  有线索告诉我
You find anything, I'll be in my office.

430
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,060
路易  我还在跟哈维的案件
Louis. Uh, I'm still working on Harvey's case.

431
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,800
杰罗姆・詹森死了都跟我没关系
Jerome Jensen can go screw himself for all I care.

432
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,130
哈维明确跟我说
Well, Harvey explicitly told me--

433
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,130
谁跟你说的我都不管  迈克
I don't care if a burning bush told you, Mike.

434
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,010
你现在唯一需要遵从的
The only commandments you need to focus on right now

435
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,330
是我的命令
come from me.

436
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,130
路易很不对劲
There's something wrong with Louis.

437
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,170
不是我的问题  我只听哈维的
It's not my problem. I answer to Harvey.

438
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,100
回家看孩子去吧  你被开除了
Sitting home alone with your kids, with no job.

439
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,450
哈维
Harvey.

440
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,040
你解决完杰罗姆的问题了吗
You solve Jerome's problem yet?

441
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,470
快了  我现在需要你的工卡
Uh, about to. But I need your corporate card first.

442
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,290
为什么
What for?

443
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,920
你不是不想听我解释吗
Well, I thought you didn't want me to explain it to you.

444
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,460
没错  我不想听
You're right. I don't.

445
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,830
行了
Okay.

446
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,240
不知道我要用这个做什么
It's killing you not knowing

447
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,410
你很难受吧
what I'm gonna use this for, isn't it?

448
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,200
不会
Nope.

449
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,190
让我告诉你吧
Please let me tell you.

450
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,990
如果你还卡的时候  上面有脱衣舞女的味道
If you bring that back to me and it smells like stripper,

451
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,020
你就被开除了
you're fired.

452
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,530
我不去那种地方
I don't--I don't go to places like that.

453
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,810
你一定要派人来吗
You had to send someone?

454
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,220
就不能直接打给我
Couldn't just call me?

455
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,120
如果你想要不被发现
If you wanted this to be private,

456
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,220
你就该直接打劫我
should have just robbed me.

457
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,140
你挪用了公款  我就不得不牵扯进其他人
You robbed the company, I had to involve other people.

458
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,380
不如我们坐下谈吧
Okay. Why don't we take a seat?

459
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,930
你找我过来干什么
Why are you here?

460
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,740
我想要告诉你一些事情
I want to tell you my side of things.

461
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,800
行
Okay.

462
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,950
对于污染水源的事情我并不引以为豪
I'm not proud of the fact that we contaminated people's water.

463
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,660
但我们已经道过歉了
But we apologized.

464
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,050
也落实了安全措施
We implemented safeguards.

465
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,680
同时还兑现了慷慨至极的赔偿
We negotiated a payout that was more than generous.

466
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,650
如果你真这么想  那你就是在自欺欺人
If that's what you think, then you are lying to yourself.

467
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,020
我觉得我们该心平气和一点
I think that we could keep this civil--

468
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,800
不  她说的对  确实
No, she's right. It's true.

469
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,130
我在自欺欺人
I am lying to myself.

470
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,330
我以为这只是阶段性的
I thought this was a phase,

471
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,630
是荷尔蒙作怪  一切都会过去
that it was hormones, that it would pass,

472
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,800
但事实是
but the truth is...

473
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,440
我养了一个贼
I raised a thief.

474
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,220
给我们点时间  谢谢
Okay, I think we're gonna need a minute. Thank you.

475
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,770
贼是吗
A thief.

476
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,880
我的研究致力于让地球更适于居住
My research is making the planet more habitable, okay?

477
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,630
而你却在搞破坏并从中牟利
You are making money destroying it.

478
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,800
你不尊重我  不要紧
You have no respect for me, that's fine.

479
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,040
但起码请尊重一下那些工人
But at least respect the workers.

480
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,610
你偷的也是他们的血汗钱
You're stealing from them too.

481
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,300
你觉得我身负此等大罪是吗
You think I'm such a criminal?

482
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,290
那就抓我啊
Arrest me.

483
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,060
我安排这次见面是为了让你们消除误会
So I organized this so that you two could clear the air,

484
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,270
不过我们似乎越走越偏了
and it seems we've gotten off the wrong foot...

485
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,480
你知道吗  老爸  这次还是老样子
You know what? It's the same story as always, dad.

486
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,930
你永远都在回避责任
You duck your responsibilities.

487
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,180
罗拉
Lo--Lola.

488
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,600
我用自己的钱还给公司如何
What if I paid the company back with my own money?

489
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,720
我不认为这是个好主意
I don't think that would be a very good idea.

490
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,810
这会让你成为同谋
It would make you a conspirator.

491
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,570
我不能把女儿交给警察
I'm not turning my daughter into the police.

492
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,290
这无关公司商誉
This is not about the company image.

493
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,660
好消息是她还没开始散钱
Well, the good news is, she hasn't distributed the money--

494
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,420
不关钱的事
The money is irrelevant.

495
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,770
我请皮尔逊・哈德曼律所帮忙解决此事
I came to Pearson Hardman to take care of this.

496
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,360
可我女儿反而和我渐行渐远
Instead, my daughter and I are further apart than ever.

497
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,970
我简直无法想象你所要面对的一切
I can't imagine how hard it is right now.

498
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,600
现在关于埃利奥特的流言四起
People are saying the most horrible things about Elliot.

499
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,780
他们一定以为我聋了
They must think I've gone deaf.

500
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,450
安东尼・马兹洛还在利用你丈夫
Anthony Mazlo has been dragging your husband's name

501
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,220
让他做替罪羊  珀金斯夫人 
through the mud to make him a scapegoat, Mrs. Perkins.

502
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,290
我是来帮忙的
I'm here to help.

503
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,290
我不明白
I don't understand.

504
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,540
你是另一边的人
You work for the other side.

505
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,660
我同样效力于某资金被全部窃取的慈善机构
I work for a charitable organization that had all its money stolen.

506
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,510
我的对立方是安东尼・马兹洛
I'm on the other side of Anthony Mazlo,

507
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,420
不是你丈夫
not your husband,

508
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,370
我不希望看到他的名声被抹黑
and I don't want to see his memory painted with the same brush.

509
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,150
需要我做什么
What would I have to do?

510
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,470
现在说这个不合时宜
This isn't the time or the place.

511
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,980
不  没关系  我该怎么做
No, it's okay. What would I have to do?

512
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,050
我想知道埃利奥特跟你说过的
I'd like to know everything

513
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,150
任何关于马兹洛的事情
Elliot has ever told you about Mazlo.

514
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,060
每个细节都很重要
Any details would help.

515
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,710
珀金斯夫人  我是路易・利特
Ms Perkins, uh, I'm Louis Litt.

516
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,750
我想告诉您
And I just want to let you know

517
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,600
我一定会竭尽所能  为您的丈夫正名
that I'm going to do whatever it takes to clear your husband's name.

518
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,790
正名
His name?

519
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,420
要不是因为你  我丈夫现在还健在
My husband would be alive today if it weren't for you.

520
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,600
话可不能这么说
Well, we don't know that.

521
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,540
我知道那天发生了什么
I know what happened in that room.

522
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,040
当时我们并不了解所有的真相
Well, at the time, we didn't have all the facts,

523
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,310
但现在我们清楚了
but now we do.

524
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,540
我真不敢相信你居然有脸到这里来
I can't believe that you have the audacity to come here.

525
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,540
我这辈子也不想再见到你
I don't ever want to see your face again.

526
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,320
你也别琢磨着让我帮忙了
And you can forget about me helping you.

527
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,030
你这是搞什么鬼啊
What the hell are you doing?

528
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,110
我跟你一样  在向遗孀取证
I was deposing the widow, just like you.

529
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,140
我来到这里表示慰问  建立友好关系
I came here to pay my respects and initiate a relationship,

530
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,700
而不是激怒一位悲痛欲绝的妇女
not aggravate a grieving woman.

531
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,930
我也是  我还买了花
Yeah, I brought flowers.

532
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,940
你让我们失去了一位潜在证人
You just cost us a potential witness.

533
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:28,960
真的吗
Oh, really?

534
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,920
也许你该事先告诉我你的计划  
Well, maybe--maybe if you shared your game plan with me--

535
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,920
就像你这样冷不丁地来一出一样吗
Oh, the same way that you shared your game plan with me?

536
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,300
你以为她见到你的反应该是如何
How do you expect her to react to seeing you?

537
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,620
你最好卯足劲  给我们找个新的证人
You need to get your shit together and find us a new witness.

538
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,500
罗拉
Lola.

539
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,560
我来为之前的事道歉
Wanted to apologize for earlier today.

540
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,960
我能进来吗
Can I come in?

541
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,810
当然
Uh, yeah. Of course.

542
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,200
很有心嘛  选园林作为见面地点
Nice gesture. Botanical gardens.

543
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,070
是啊  他说你们俩对那里有特殊的感情
Yeah, he said it was a pretty special place for you guys.

544
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,120
的确如此  接着他就成了总裁
It was. And then he became CEO.

545
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,960
我可不是来这追忆往事的
But I'm not here to reminisce.

546
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,330
我不得不赞叹一下
I must say I was, uh, really impressed

547
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,620
你竟然猜出了我的想法
you figured out what I was doing.

548
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,590
尤其是你还算不上一位正牌律师
Especially since you're not even a real lawyer.

549
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,040
你这话什么意思
What--what are you talking about?

550
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,270
我查看了哈佛法学院男毕业生名录
I accessed Harvard law school's alumni directory.

551
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,800
过去十年毕业生的所有记录
Every class that graduated for the last ten years.

552
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,140
压根没有叫迈克・罗斯的
No record of Mike Ross. At all.

553
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,540
是  院长办公室本该修正的
Yeah, the dean's office was supposed to fix that.

554
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,460
他们把我的名字登记错了
They--they put my name wrong in the system.

555
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,060
我将你的社保号与数据库做了对比
I checked your social security number against the database.

556
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,010
你怎么会知道我的社保号
How'd you get my social security number?

557
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,650
小事一桩  你听好
Easily. Here's the deal.

558
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,160
别插手我的事  不然我就揭发你
Leave me alone, or I expose you.

559
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,330
你好像完全不担心这事
You don't really seem that worried about this.

560
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,180
她恐吓你  这是个策略
Threats like hers are a tactic.

561
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,240
这招很有效  因为它会把你的注意力
They're effective because they distract you

562
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,600
从正事上分散开
from what you're supposed to be doing.

563
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,530
你是疯了吗
Are you crazy?

564
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,610
我们该做的是赶紧躲远点吧
What we should be doing is backing the hell off.

565
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,870
那之后会怎么样呢
And how would that go, huh?

566
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,940
杰罗姆  你找我们帮忙
"Jerome, you came to us with the problem,"

567
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,030
我们发现你的女儿
"we discovered that your daughter"

568
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,900
从贵公司盗走了两百万
"stole $2 million from your company,"

569
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,860
而我们的结论是你太他妈倒霉了
"and our conclusion is you're shit out of luck"?

570
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,550
我一点也不在乎结果怎样
I don't really care how it would go.

571
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,040
我只在乎的自己的人生
All I care about is my life,

572
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,780
以及守住我们的秘密
and--and keeping our secret.

573
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,920
我跟你说了  这只不过是个策略
I told you, it's a distraction.

574
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,540
她不会真干的
She won't pull that trigger.

575
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,240
你以为她为何迟迟不把那笔资金散出去
Why do you think she hasn't distributed that money yet?

576
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,760
你以为杰罗姆为何不想我们联络警方
Why do you think Jerome doesn't want us to go to the police?

577
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,700
我不知道
I don't know.

578
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,180
因为他们双方都希望能冰释前嫌
It's because they both want to bury the hatchet,

579
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,830
而一旦动了真格  就和解不了了
And if any of that stuff happens, they can't.

580
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,790
我们该怎么办
Then what?

581
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,680
想办法让他们握手言和咯
Figure out a way to make them reconcile.

582
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,680
就这么简单
It's easy.

583
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,380
是够简单的
Yeah. It's easy.

584
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,610
是伊内兹吗  我是路易・利特
Inez, right? Louis litt.

585
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,670
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

586
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,840
这就是你为马兹洛做的工作吗
So is this what you do for Mazlo?

587
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,010
你负责洗他的脏衣服
You clean up his dirty laundry?

588
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:56,930
离我远点
Leave me alone.

589
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,390
你知道自己前途无量吗
You know, you have your whole career ahead of you.

590
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,720
到时候马兹洛倒了台  你作为帮凶
Mazlo goes down and you're part of this cover-up,

591
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,760
没人会肯雇你
no one's gonna hire you.

592
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,700
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

593
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,680
我能告诉你些事吗  伊内兹
Listen, can I just tell you something, Inez?

594
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,330
以我的经验来看  人会被两种手段驱使
In my experience, people respond to two things, okay?

595
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,080
那就是利诱和威逼
And that's the carrot and the stick.

596
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,430
现在我更倾向于来硬的
Now, I prefer the stick,

597
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,940
因此如果你不帮我
and if you do not help me,

598
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,790
我会用我丰富的专业经验来让你就范
I will devote my considerable expertise to sticking it to you.

599
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,850
就像逼迫珀金斯那样吗
The same way you stuck it to Perkins.

600
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,510
伊内兹  等等
Inez, stop.

601
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,720
咱们还是谈谈条件吧
Let's go with the carrot.

602
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,580
伊内兹  我是哈维・斯佩克特
Inez, Harvey Specter.

603
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,270
很感激你能前来
I appreciate you coming forward.

604
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,640
我早就该来了
I should have done it sooner.

605
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,490
为什么改变了呢
What changed?

606
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,560
我再也受不了在那公司做事了
I can't be a part of a company like that anymore.

607
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
你准备好在公开法庭上举证
Are you ready to testify against Anthony Mazlo

608
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,800
安东尼・马兹洛了吗
in open court?

609
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,340
是的
I am.

610
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,400
你应该有指证他违法渎职的文件资料吧
I assume you've documented his malfeasance.

611
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,220
不然的话就是口说无凭
Because otherwise it's he said, she said.

612
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,610
全部的书面记录
The entire paper trail.

613
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,080
从最开始到上个星期的
From the beginning all the way to last week.

614
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,000
哈维让我解决罗拉的问题
Harvey asked me to fix this problem with Lola,

615
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,950
但我做不到
but I can't.

616
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,240
因为令爱并非问题所在  詹森先生
Because your daughter's not the problem, Mr. Jensen.

617
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,970
你才是
You are.

618
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,160
你是想被炒鱿鱼吗
Are you trying to get fired?

619
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,960
不  我不是
No. I'm not.

620
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,510
我是你的代理人
I'm your attorney.

621
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,110
为你提建议是我的职责
It's my job to give you advice.

622
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,810
但你是她的父亲
But you're her father.

623
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,480
对孩子的悉心培养是你的职责
It's your job to raise her.

624
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,900
你大可以更换代理律所
Now, you can go to another firm,

625
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,440
但是世上没有哪位律师
but there's not a lawyer in the city

626
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,760
能替你完成这份职责
that can do that job for you.

627
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,820
请不要在为人父母这个问题上教育我
Please don't lecture me on parenting.

628
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,720
詹森先生  我曾与我父亲关系恶劣
Mr. Jensen, I had a difficult relationship with my father,

629
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,170
所以请相信我  罗拉是想原谅你的
so trust me when I tell you that Lola wants to forgive you,

630
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,090
但她需要你先退一步
but she needs you to take the first step.

631
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,370
我们也试过了
Well, we tried it your way.

632
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,110
一起共进午饭  你也目睹结果了
We went to lunch, and you saw how well that worked out.

633
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,790
我女儿不是小孩子了
My daughter's not a child.

634
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,610
她是个成年人
She's an adult.

635
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,910
也以成年人的身份做了这些决定
She made these choices as an adult.

636
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,890
如果你能找到办法
If you just found a way...

637
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,050
你是我的律师  我与你只谈法律
You're my lawyer. This is a legal problem.

638
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,570
我女儿的行为是她自己的选择
My daughter brought this on herself.

639
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,120
现在尽管我极不情愿她坐牢
Now, I desperately do not want her to go to prison.

640
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,110
但如果她不把钱还回来  她就蹲定了
But if she doesn't return the money, she will.

641
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,700
马兹洛在哪
Where's Mazlo?

642
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,150
他不敢亲自面对我们吗
He was afraid to face us himself?

643
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:24,930
你们想怎么样
What do you want?

644
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,530
我们知道你们的整个计划
We know about your entire scheme.

645
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,140
什么计划
What scheme?

646
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,120
马兹洛去迪拜洗黑钱的计划
Oh, the scheme where Mazlo's laundering money through Dubai.

647
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,670
你怎么知道迪拜的事
How do you know about Dubai?

648
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,530
我们有了新的信息源
We cultivated another source.

649
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,340
你们希望怎样和解
What kind of settlement are you looking for?

650
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,920
至少要有惩罚性损害赔偿金吧
One that includes punitive damages.

651
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,350
让伊内兹进来
Send Inez in here, please.

652
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,550
我想你应该找不到她吧
I don't think you'll find her at her desk.

653
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,420
怎么会
Why not?

654
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,100
她同意为我们作证了
'Cause she agreed to testify for us.

655
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,440
我深表怀疑
I doubt that.

656
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,100
你同事联络她时
When your colleague approached her,

657
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,520
她直接汇报给了我们
she came straight to us.

658
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,880
他甚至想要贿赂我
He even tried to bribe me.

659
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,980
他说如果我出卖马兹洛先生
He said if I ratted out Mr. Mazlo,

660
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,550
就能让我做杰西卡・皮尔逊的助手
he'd get me a job as an assistant to Jessica Pearson.

661
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,280
她告诉你的每件事都是假的
Everything she told you is a complete fabrication.

662
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,180
根本就没有什么迪拜
There is no Dubai.

663
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,020
让我来提醒一下你们
I seem to recall you mentioning something

664
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,800
我们在上次会面中提到的对伪证的处罚
about penalties for perjury at our last meeting.

665
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,540
对于贿赂证人的处罚将更加严重
Well, the penalty for bribing a witness is just as severe.

666
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,810
我们乐意忽略此次轻率行为
And we're willing to overlook that indiscretion

667
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,090
只要你们能说服你们的客户接受和解条款
if you convince your client to take our settlement offer.

668
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,660
当然了  是重新修订的和解条款
Well, our revised settlement offer.

669
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,670
-重新修订的  -没错
- Revised? - Yes.

670
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,280
也就是之前所说的一半金额
Exactly half of what it was before.

671
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,410
你到底怎么想的啊
What the hell were you thinking?

672
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,640
我们需要新的证人
We needed a new witness.

673
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,250
你就没想到要查查她的底吗
You didn't think to look into her story?

674
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,620
不知道  你查了吗
I don't know. Did you look into it?

675
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,820
是你带她来的
You were the one who brought her in.

676
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,960
我以为你查了呢
I assumed you had.

677
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,720
就算一个二把刀的律师也知道要查吧
Like any halfway decent lawyer would.

678
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,840
我们形势严峻
We were under the gun.

679
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,220
况且有人颐指气使地给我下死命令
And I was under strict instructions from my golf pro

680
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,080
让我再去找个证人来
to get another witness.

681
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,590
我是让你找个证人
No, I told you to get another witness,

682
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,520
不是买个来
not bribe one.

683
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,520
够了
That's enough.

684
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,230
尽管路易被要挟
As for the threat against Louis,

685
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,580
至少资金还没有转移
no money changed hands.

686
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,030
我担心的不是路易
I'm not concerned with Louis.

687
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,690
他把你也牵扯进来了  懂吗
He brought your name into it, okay?

688
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,550
他提的条件是给你做助理
The offer was to be your assistant.

689
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,940
这样就等于把你拉下水了
Now you're exposed because of what he did.

690
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:17,780
这是真的吗
Is that true?

691
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,870
她是大投资公司头头的行政助理
She's an executive assistant to the head of a major investment firm.

692
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,750
怎么可能让她屈尊给初级合伙人打工
She's not gonna work for a junior partner.

693
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,980
所以你就试图贿赂她
So you tried to bribe her.

694
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,340
我那不是贿赂  杰西卡
No, it wasn't a bribe, Jessica.

695
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,750
只是想激她一下
It was an incentive.

696
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,180
我觉得要想让她开口
I thought she'd be more likely to talk

697
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,100
就必须免除她被解雇的顾忌
if she wasn't worried about getting fired.

698
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,890
你去马兹洛那里接受他们的条件吧
I want you to go to Mazlo and take their offer.

699
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,860
-我还不想那么做  -我也是
- I'm not ready to do that. - I'm not either.

700
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,960
我退回露西尔的佣金
I waived Lucille's fee

701
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,430
是因为某个资深合伙人
because a certain senior partner

702
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,700
说这事不会闹上法庭
said we'd never go to trial.

703
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,550
这话是在你把路易塞给我之前说的
I said that before you stuck me with Louis.

704
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,490
那不是重点
Not the point.

705
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,930
她输不起  我们也一样
She can't afford it, and neither can we.

706
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,490
给我点时间
Give me time.

707
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,460
让我来办  路易别插手
Give it to me without Louis,

708
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,600
我们走着瞧  看看输不起的是谁
and we'll see who can afford it and who can't.

709
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,530
到今晚截止
You have until the end of the day.

710
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,450
你若一无所获
You come up empty,

711
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,400
我就亲自去找露西尔谈
I'm taking the offer to Lucille myself.

712
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,040
杰西卡  我去找珀金斯...
Jessica. I went to Perkins--

713
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,300
一个字也别说了
Not another word.

714
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,590
你再敢那么干
You try something like that again,

715
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,330
就收拾包袱走人吧
and it will be your last day at this firm.

716
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,440
你说杰罗姆不会动真格
You said Jerome wouldn't pull the trigger.

717
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,940
你错了  他已经蓄势待发了
You were wrong. He's ready.

718
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,670
我现在没工夫管那个
I don't have time for that right now.

719
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,560
哈维  等警察找上罗拉
Harvey, when the police show up at Lola's doorstep,

720
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,620
我们就完了
we're done.

721
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,400
她把钱送出去了吗
Has she distributed the money yet?

722
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,490
不  还没呢  不过她
No, she hasn't, but she's--

723
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,430
还没  也不会
She hasn't, and she won't,

724
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,040
因为她想要的是她老爸的注意力 
because what she wants is her daddy's attention.

725
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,210
你坐下  我们处理这件事
Now sit down with me, and let's deal with this.

726
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,590
好  好吧
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

727
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,790
说说你要我做什么吧
Why don't you tell me what you need?

728
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,460
露西尔的捐款不翼而飞的当天
Mazlo was in Liechtenstein the day that

729
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,360
马兹洛人在列支敦士登
Lucille's endowment evaporated.

730
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,760
或许他去滑雪了
Maybe he was skiing.

731
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,720
才没人去列支敦士登度假呢
Nobody goes to Liechtenstein for pleasure.

732
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,240
我们为什么不发传票索取银行记录
Why don't we subpoena the bank records?

733
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,500
那里能有多少银行
How many banks can there be?

734
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,950
那地方比瑞士还恐怖[银行多]
Place is like Switzerland on steroids.

735
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,160
我们不可能拿到那些记录
We'll never see those records.

736
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,500
那你他妈到底要我做什么
So what the hell do you want from me, then?

737
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,180
你刚刚说什么
What did you just say to me?

738
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:14,010
我曾提议黑进哈佛的资料库来办妥我的事
I once suggested that we hack Harvard's records to cover my ass,

739
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,550
可你不屑一顾
and you laughed at me.

740
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,810
现在证明你错了
And now it turns out that you were wrong,

741
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,440
而我就要为此饭碗不保
and it's about to cost me my career.

742
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:20,940
你去哪
Where are you going?

743
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,250
你让我解决我的案子
You told me to fix my case.

744
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,770
那你也自己解决吧
Why don't you fix yours?

745
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,510
希望你是来告诉我哈维不再多管闲事了
Hope you came here to tell me Harvey's backing off.

746
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,450
我也希望  可惜非也
I wish I could, but he's not.

747
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,430
真是可惜了你的似锦前程
That's too bad. Had such a promising career.

748
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,700
老天  罗拉
Oh, my god, Lola,

749
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,030
你装得像个圣人君子
you act like you care about a higher cause,

750
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,910
可这么多公司  你偏选了你爸爸的
but of all the companies that exist, you chose your dad's.

751
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,080
而这家公司还试着弥补他们的过失
Company that's trying to make amends for what it did.

752
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,600
我才懒得听你这种朝衣冠禽兽努力的人
Really don't need to hear another speech

753
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,260
给我上大课
from a wanna-be suit.

754
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,320
天啊  你觉得我是你的敌人  是吗
God, you think I'm your enemy, huh?

755
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,880
我不是
Well, I'm not.

756
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,310
我不是来和你谈我  或你父亲的
I didn't even come here to talk to you about me or your father.

757
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,610
纽约  爱荷华  堪萨斯
New york. Iowa. Kansas.

758
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,530
四十个州都有即将成为泡影的住宅计划
40 states that all have housing projects that will vanish

759
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,560
而只有你能帮我们找出所需信息
if we don't find out information that only you can help us get.

760
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,420
你可以偷你爸公司的钱
So you can steal money from your father's company

761
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,250
也可以去告发我
or you can blow the whistle on me if you want to,

762
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,680
但如果你是真的关心你所声称的那些人
but if you really care about people the way that you claim to,

763
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,450
这才是你该先做的
you're gonna do this first.

764
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,990
有收获吗
Are we close?

765
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,340
我在通过天朝的服务器进入银行
I'm accessing the banks through a server in China.

766
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,470
莫非你想我就用你这边的
Unless you'd rather me use yours.

767
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,030
-慢慢来  -进去了
- Take your time. - Done.

768
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,660
列支敦士登有十六家银行
All right, there's 16 banks in Liechtenstein.

769
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,610
这里列有每家银行的每个账户
This is every account in every single one of them.

770
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,850
没有一个账户在安东尼・马兹洛名下
None of the accounts is listed under Anthony Mazlo.

771
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,930
别管名字了
Forget about the name.

772
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,060
找到安厦建筑的资金被盗那天
Find an account with $150 million

773
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,700
户头上多了一亿五千万的账户
embezzled from Stable Shelters on that day.

774
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,320
哈维  时间到了
Harvey, it's time.

775
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,960
你要是没查到什么
Unless you have something,

776
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,900
我就打电话找露西尔来和解了
I'm calling Lucille to settle.

777
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,760
杰西卡  你知道列支敦士登
Jessica, you know how Liechtenstein

778
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,310
完全不理会传票
doesn't respond to subpoenas,

779
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,400
所以我就主动上门了
so I've responded for them.

780
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,340
相信我
Just trust me.

781
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,310
要找到露西尔的钱  我们已万事俱备
We've got everything we need to find Lucille's money.

782
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,670
没在这里
It's not here.

783
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,740
看来你一时半会儿搞不定
Sounds like you need more than just another minute.

784
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,550
你果真是欠东风
You need another person.

785
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,290
你需要一个精通金融犯罪的人
Someone whose expertise is financial crime.

786
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,870
不  不
No. No.

787
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,280
哈维  去找路易
Harvey, bring in Louis.

788
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,520
不然我就给露西尔打电话
Or I'm calling Lucille.

789
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,620
唐娜  我要跟路易谈谈
Donna, I need to talk to Louis.

790
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,670
他不在办公室
He's not in his office.

791
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,330
怎么  诺玛不告诉你他在哪吗
huh. Norma wouldn't tell you where he is?

792
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,730
她没有...
Well, she didn't, um...

793
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
你就没问吧
You didn't ask her, did you?

794
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,910
她让我毛骨悚然的
She gives me the creeps.

795
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,700
你可真是个软蛋
Ugh. You're such a wuss.

796
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,650
你刚刚说什么
What did you just say to me?

797
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,290
少装没听到
I think we both know what I just said.

798
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,770
诺玛  他在哪
Norma, where is he?

799
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,760
什么  你开玩笑呢吧
What? You're kidding.

800
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,040
怎么了
What?

801
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,030
我需要一个人静静时就来这里
I come here when I need to be alone.

802
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,520
点44马格南
.44 magnum?

803
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,510
你当真
Really?

804
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,780
今天很有感觉吗  小阿飞
Feeling lucky today, punk?

805
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,220
我知道
You know, I understand

806
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,870
我把案子搞砸了
that me pissing the bed on this case

807
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,190
你一定心里暗爽
must be really, really fun for you.

808
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,330
不  路易  不是这样的
No. Louis, it's not.

809
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,530
我们唯一的共同点
The one thing you and I have in common

810
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,090
就是我们都需要赢
is we need to win.

811
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,310
这我知道
I noticed that.

812
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,940
我来这里是因为  尽管事态不好
I came here because, even after everything,

813
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,140
我们还是能赢
we can win.

814
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,280
不
No.

815
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,440
是我只能看着你赢
I can watch while you win.

816
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,060
路易  我不是来跟你闲扯的
Louis, I'm not here to give you shit.

817
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,200
听我说  我尊敬你
Listen, I respect you.

818
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,350
我贿赂证人
I bribed a witness.

819
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,020
你是想激她一下
You incentivized her.

820
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,350
我去找了珀金斯的遗孀
Went to see Perkins' widow.

821
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,740
是想道歉
To apologize.

822
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,090
我害死了个人
I killed a man.

823
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,020
你知道他本就大限将至
That you thought had it coming.

824
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,490
我想你没听到我的话
I don't think you heard what I said.

825
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,490
我尊敬你
I respect you.

826
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,950
你是需要我帮忙
You need my help.

827
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,570
我倒不会那么说
I wouldn't phrase it exactly like that.

828
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,800
如果你需要我帮忙
Well, if you need my help,

829
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,480
你最好斟字酌句说清楚了
you better phrase it exactly like that.

830
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,600
好吧  你想我开口是吗
Okay. You want me to say it?

831
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,600
那我就说
I'll say it.

832
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,840
现在迫在眉睫了  我需要你的帮助
I'm under the gun, and I need your help.

833
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,760
我有信息资源
I've got information,

834
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,260
而你有解决案子所需的金融专业头脑
and you've got the financial expertise to break this case.

835
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,040
咱们把抢放下  去收拾他们吧
Now let's put the gun down and go get 'em.

836
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,460
好的
Okay.

837
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,360
你先站前面去
First just stand over there.

838
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,450
别得寸进尺
Don't push it.

839
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,480
安厦建筑的账户究竟
So what was the exact amount of money

840
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,220
损失了多少金额
that was lost from Stable Shelters' account?

841
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,010
为什么问这个
Why?

842
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,620
1亿5千237万5千242美元18美分
$152,375,242.18.

843
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,270
我很擅长数字活儿
I'm good with numbers.

844
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,290
说说你查到些什么
All right. What do you have?

845
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,730
列支敦士登十六家银行
We've compiled a printout of every account

846
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,710
出事那天所有有过存款记录的账户
that had a deposit made on the day in question

847
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,080
资料都打印出来了
in all of Liechtenstein's 16 banks.

848
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,580
好的  我们要专攻  借用一下
Okay. Well, we are going to focus on, excuse me...

849
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,930
这五家银行
these five banks.

850
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
你凭什么确定
How can you be sure?

851
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,460
听好了
Watch this.

852
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,920
这四家银行曾屈服于法庭压力
These four banks have a history of capitulating to subpoenas.

853
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,250
马兹洛事先会搞清楚
So Mazlo would know.

854
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,210
这六家在美国有母公司
These six have U.S. corporate parents,

855
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,500
使他们受制于联邦政府监管
which would expose their accounts to federal scrutiny.

856
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,850
同样  马兹洛也知道
Once again, Mazlo would know.

857
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,370
然后这边的这家银行储备金不足
And then the one that he's got right there is low in reserves,

858
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,210
意味着偿付能力有限
therefore its solvency's in question,

859
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,290
而马兹洛绝不可能把挪用的款项
and there is no way in hell that Mazlo would take his stolen money

860
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,480
存进一家摇摇欲坠的银行
and put it into some shaky bank.

861
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,720
所以我们能够确定
So we can be sure.

862
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,900
那些盗用公款的人
Every person who embezzles money,

863
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,210
都有一套自己独特的行事风格
they do it in their own way.

864
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,340
但他们的共同之处
But the one thing that they all have in common

865
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,720
在于他们绝不会孤注一掷
is that they never put all their eggs in one basket.

866
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,390
因此我们面对的会是多个账户组合的情况
So we are going to be looking at a combination of accounts.

867
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,280
横跨不同银行
Across banks.

868
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,520
也许是不同的银行
Well, I mean, maybe across banks.

869
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,520
也有可能是同一家
Maybe the same bank.

870
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,900
但肯定会有多个账户
But we're definitely looking at more than one account.

871
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,030
那我们如何识别出哪些账户是他的
How do we figure out which accounts are his?

872
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,880
凭总和  因为所有账户的资金
Because they're all gonna add up

873
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:25,970
加和后的总量必然
to the same exact amount of money

874
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,510
和安厦建筑损失的金额一致
that was lost from Stable Shelters' account.

875
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:28,900
你怎么知道
Well, how do you know?

876
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,250
有出必有入
When the account was drained, it had to go somewhere.

877
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,170
露西尔所失必然等于马兹洛所得
What goes out from Lucille's had to go into Mazlo's.

878
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,550
很简单的数学法则
Simple law of mathematics.

879
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,830
那么我们只需要找到账户组合
So we just have to figure out a combination of accounts

880
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,390
总量等于...
that adds up to...

881
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,740
1亿5千237万5千242美元18美分
$152,375,242.18.

882
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
我也擅长数字活儿
I'm good with numbers too.

883
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,750
感谢你们能立刻前来
Thanks for meeting us on such short notice.

884
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,550
我猜你们是准备接受我们的出价了
Well, I assume you're ready to take our offer.

885
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,560
于是飞奔过来了
I rushed right down.

886
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,940
在那之前  我们还有
Well, we just have a few questions

887
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,000
几个问题需要确认
before we get to any of that.

888
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,100
我们不接受任何询问
We didn't agree to answer any questions.

889
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,660
不  不  罗伯特  不要紧
No, no, robert, it's okay.

890
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,220
我乐意奉陪
I'm happy to play.

891
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,160
马兹洛先生  你去过列支敦士登吗
Have you ever been to Liechtenstein, Mr. Mazlo?

892
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,770
我去过很多地方
You know, I've been to many places.

893
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,580
其中包括列支敦士登
Among them, Liechtenstein.

894
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,360
真的吗  那么在众多去处中
Really? Well, of those many places,

895
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,360
你是否曾设立七个不同的银行账户
did you open seven different bank accounts,

896
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,660
存款总额与露西尔・杰克森的
the amounts of which add up to exactly the same amount of money

897
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,210
资助基金消失的金额完全相同呢
that disappeared from Lucille Jackson's endowment fund?

898
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,430
我表示怀疑  但能肯定的是
I doubt it. Uh, what I don't doubt

899
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,230
如果你查查那些账户的资金来源
is that if you trace the money that went into those accounts,

900
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,210
你会发现它们都来自于
you'll find that it came

901
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,460
我们公司在斯里兰卡的办事处
from our corporate offices in Sri Lanka.

902
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,820
完全合法
It's completely legitimate.

903
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,220
我非常乐意出示交易记录
I mean, I'm happy to show you the records, uh,

904
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,390
你们随时都可以审查
whenever you'd like.

905
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,630
多和谐  不是吗
That's great. Isn't that great?

906
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,180
在那之后  你能否再给我们看看
Well, after that, can you show us the records

907
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,590
当天你在那几家银行
of the seven safety deposit boxes

908
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,720
开设的七个保险箱的记录呢
that you opened at those same banks the same day?

909
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,070
我不需要回答
I don't have to answer that.

910
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,480
这不是取证
This isn't a deposition.

911
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,640
你说的很对  这更像是在表态
You're so right. It's more of a presentation.

912
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,870
我们也可以弄成取证
We could make it a deposition.

913
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,540
-或是庭审  -由你决定
- Or trial. - up to you.

914
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,360
我们手上有你进入那些银行的照片
We have pictures of you entering those banks.

915
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,700
我们也完全有能力传唤他们作证
And we have enough to crack their subpoenas.

916
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,520
只是早晚而已  托尼
Just a matter of time, Tony.

917
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,270
好吧  你想怎么样
All right. What do you want?

918
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,630
我想怎么...  这和我无关
What do I wa--? Well, it's not about me.

919
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,910
露西尔才是关键
It's about Lucille.

920
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,840
她想要你游街示众
She wants your head on a stick

921
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,800
要她和解有两个条件
But she'll settle

922
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,510
一是钱物归原主
for her money back.

923
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,770
二是你递交辞呈
And your resignation.

924
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,360
只要我们在这里达成一致
We agree right here,

925
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,210
就不会有刑事诉讼对吗
no criminal prosecution?

926
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,160
成交
Done.

927
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,380
如果露西尔今天没拿回她的资金
If Lucille doesn't get her money back today,

928
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,190
一切协议作废
nothing's done.

929
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,940
很好  非常好
Great. That's perfect.

930
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,080
你可以正常营业了
You are back in business.

931
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,560
资金已经汇过来了
The wire transfer just went through.

932
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,300
你挺过来了  姑娘
Girl, you came through.

933
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,930
我们就是做这个的
That is what we do.

934
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,550
哈维  哈维  进来
Harvey. Harvey, get in here.

935
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,210
露西尔想当面谢谢你
Lucille wants to thank you in person.

936
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,150
必须有时间接受感激嘛
Always got time for gratitude.

937
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,870
哈维  你当初没让我和解
Harvey, you didn't let me settle,

938
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,490
我很欣赏你的毅力
and I appreciate your tenacity.

939
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,240
事实是  这不是我一个人办成的
Truth is, I didn't do this on my own.

940
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,320
你认识路易・利特吗
Have you met Louis Litt?

941
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,480
你们干得真漂亮
You guys are doing such good work.

942
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,580
我只是想让你们知道
I just want you to know it.

943
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,250
我说过你是公司不可多得的人才吗
Have I told you how valuable you are to this company?

944
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,600
因为你不是  开个玩笑
'Cuz you're not. I'm just kidding.

945
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,110
詹尼斯  今天放你一天假
Janice, I want you to take the rest of the day off

946
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,610
因为你很棒  我是认真的
because you're so good. And I really mean it.

947
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,400
霍华德  九点半  龙舌兰

948

你和我  准时到那
You and me. Sharp. Be there.

949
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,340
路易  小路易
Louis. Luiz.

950
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,160
怎么了
What's up?

951
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,290
你在那里做什么
What were you just doing in there?

952
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,470
什么  我只是在...
What? I was just...

953
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,690
让我猜猜  你在排挤我
Let me guess. You were cutting me out.

954
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,390
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

955
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,400
你和杰西卡还有露西尔开小会
The little impromptu meeting you just had with Jessica and Lucille

956
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,800
轻而易举地将我排挤在外
that you conveniently left me out of.

957
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,910
我没有在任何事情上排挤你啊
I didn't leave you out of anything.

958
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,720
我还以为我们是一个团队
I mean, I thought we were a team.

959
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,640
我以为我们的关系翻开了新的篇章
I thought this was the start of something,

960
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,040
但是我...
but I--

961
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,300
现在我总算看清了
Now I see the truth all too clearly.

962
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,320
路易  我只是路过
Louis, I was walking by,

963
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,590
她们叫我进去而已
and they called me in.

964
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,370
没错  正赶上时机将我所做的归功于你
Yeah, just in time to take the credit for what I did.

965
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,520
我可没那么做
I didn't do that.

966
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,660
一丁点这种想法都没有
Wouldn't even think of doing that.

967
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,870
但是你知道吗
But you know what?

968
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,480
你会这么想  这就是你的问题
You would, and that's your problem right there.

969
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,940
收到你那封关于马兹洛的邮件了
Got your email about Mazlo.

970
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,960
可以让洛克斯利有限责任公司完美散场了
Not a bad way for Locksley Llc to go out.

971
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,630
看来公司欠你一个人情
Looks like the firm owes you one.

972
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,640
欠我人情的是你吧
I think you owe me one.

973
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,000
哈佛学位证书  迈克・詹姆斯・罗斯  法学博士

974
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,490
-这是  -货真价实
- Is this... - The real thing?

975
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,050
没错
Yeah.

976
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,240
我通知院长办公室说你的丢失了
Told the dean's office you'd lost yours,

977
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,020
而他们乐意为优秀毕业生效劳
and they were happy to oblige for one of their top graduates.

978
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,150
真不知道我是该崇拜你还是畏惧你
I don't know if you're awesome or terrifying.

979
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,890
我还给你加了固
Also I added a layer of protection for you.

980
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,290
这不是哈佛法学院的校友库吗
Uh, the Harvard Law School alumni database?

981
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,050
都在那  你的名字  班级排名
It's all there. Your name, class rank,

982
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,800
社保号
Social security number.

983
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,960
你应该知道你让我成犯罪同伙了  对吗
You do realize you just made me party to a crime, right?

984
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,560
你可以随时电话问询
Can always call 'em up,

985
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,100
就说出故障了
report it as a glitch.

986
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,010
让我猜猜  无法追溯
Let me guess. Untraceable.

987
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,470
我不是说你不会被抓住
I'm not saying you won't get caught,

988
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,230
但不会因资料不符被抓
but it won't be because your story doesn't check.

989
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,560
谢谢你
Thank you.

990
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,220
真的
Seriously.

991
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,970
你是对的
You're right.

992
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,380
是该和我爸爸应该好好相处
Working things out with my dad.

993
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,850
你并非我想的那样徒有衣表
Not the empty suit I thought you were.

994
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,780
那是谁
Who was that?

995
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,220
客户的女儿
Uh, client's daughter.

996
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,740
真的吗  天色已晚
Really? It's kind of late.

997
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,410
这个时候她来办公室做什么
What's she doing at the office at this hour?

998
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,960
她只是专程来感谢我
You know, she was, uh, just thanking me.

999
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,360
-感谢你  -是的
- Thanking you. - Mm-hmm.

1000
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,590
她谢得如何
How'd she do that?

1001
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,430
很随意
Easily.

1002
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,290
她给我买了两张去希腊的机票
She bought me two tickets to Greece.

1003
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,350
不感兴趣
Not interested.

1004
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,910
我们周二出发
We leave tuesday.
