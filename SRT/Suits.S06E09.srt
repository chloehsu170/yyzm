{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,080
我让加洛以敲诈罪的名义进了监狱
I put Gallo away for racketeering.

16
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,210
但这并不是他真正的罪行
But that's not what he really did.

17
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,310
你说什么
What are you talking about?

18
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,010
我们发现他参与了谋杀案
We had him for conspiracy to commit murder,

19
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,040
警方把他供认的录像带
and the police let the tape of that bastard admitting

20
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,940
落在证据链外二十分钟  有意让证据无效
that he did it out of the chain of custody for 20 minutes.

21
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,420
你有不在场证明的证人
You had an alibi witness,

22
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,250
然而你的公诉人却让她走掉了
and your public defender let her get away?

23
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,450
我一直都是这么说的啊
That's what I've been saying!

24
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,750
我并没有一个能做不在场证明的证人
I didn't have an alibi witness.

25
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,500
证人凭空消失了
I had a no-show who vanished into thin air.

26
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,570
你至少可以
Well, you could've asked for

27
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,720
要求延期受审来找到她
postponement to have time to find her.

28
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,370
我是可以  只是还有个小问题
And I would have, except for one thing:

29
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,720
当我要求她说出事发那时他们
when I pressed her as to what the two of them

30
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,330
两个人在做什么
were doing at the time of those murders,

31
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,240
她承认说他们吸了冰毒
she admitted they were both on meth.

32
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,390
加洛的动议被退回来了
Gallo's filing came back,

33
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,380
这个动议需要由其辩护律师本人提出
and it needs to be filed by his attorney of record.

34
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,390
你要我代理那个野兽
You want me to represent that animal?

35
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,430
其实挺好笑的  不是吗
Kind of funny, isn't it?

36
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,100
当初你花大力气把我弄进来
You fighting to get me out

37
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,630
现在你想要弄我出去
when you fought so hard to put me away.

38
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,030
我确实觉得很恶心
It makes me sick to my stomach,

39
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,960
但你会给我回报的
but you're gonna give me something in return.

40
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,200
你不仅不能找迈克的麻烦
Not only are you gonna keep your hands off Mike,

41
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,980
还要做他的私人保镖
you're gonna be his personal protector in here.

42
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,310
你让我妻子免受牢狱之灾
You kept my wife out of prison.

43
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,110
在我看来  我们已经扯平了
As far as I'm concerned, that makes us square.

44
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,080
哈维和迈克成功了
Harvey and Mike did it,

45
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,890
意味着迈克能回家了
which means Mike's coming home.

46
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,270
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

47
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,350
约书亚来了电话
Joshua called.

48
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,000
他明天要来城里住两天
He's coming to town tomorrow.

49
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,910
你要跟他分手吗
Are you gonna break up with him?

50
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,020
我不知道
I don't know.

51
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,440
很感谢你能这么做
I really appreciate you doing this.

52
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,770
如果你没有在这里陪我
and... if you weren't with me,

53
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,000
我很难想象自己如何承受
I can't imagine how I'd handle

54
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,410
塔拉不知到底会不会和约书亚分手这件事
whether or not Tara is breaking up with Joshua.

55
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,970
约书亚  这是什么名字
Joshua--what is he?

56
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,850
某个傻缺国的国王吗
Lord of the Kingdom of Dicken-stein,

57
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,250
统治着傻缺山头上的臣民
reigning over his subjects from high atop Douche Mountain?

58
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,530
总之谢谢你能来
Anyway, thanks for being here.

59
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,420
除了塔拉  
Aside from Tara,

60
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,190
你是我生命中最重要的女人
you're the most important woman in my entire life.

61
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,240
我的天哪  路易
Oh, my God, Louis.

62
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,770
泥浴真是
Mudding is...

63
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,090
太爽了
amazing.

64
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,160
刚刚这半个小时我都睡着了
I actually just fell asleep for the last half hour.

65
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,350
天哪  唐娜
Goddamn it, Donna.

66
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,140
我带你来不是让你在我
I didn't bring you here so you could fall asleep

67
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,850
向你吐露心声时睡觉的
while I'm pouring my heart out.

68
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,990
你是我见过最自私的女人
You're the most selfish woman I ever met.

69
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,910
我以为你刚说过我是你人生中除了塔拉以外
I thought you just told me I was the most important

70
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,930
最重要的女人
non-Tara woman in your life.

71
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,070
等等  你不是睡着了吗
Wait a second. I thought you just fell asleep.

72
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,250
刚刚这三十秒
And for the last thirty seconds,

73
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,010
你是在生我的气还是生约书亚的气
have you been mad at me or upset about Joshua?

74
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,440
天哪  你真是个天才
Holy shit, you're a genius.

75
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,170
所以等我们回到了办公室
Which is why when we get back to the office,

76
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,560
你要负责匹配
you're reconciling everyone's billings

77
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,890
所有人最近六周的账单
for the last six weeks.

78
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,650
唐娜  那是我所能经历的
Oh, Donna, that is the worst form of torture

79
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,500
最残酷的折磨了
I can go through.

80
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,320
不  路易  对你来说
No, Louis, the worst form of torture

81
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,260
最残酷的折磨是脑子里面
is what you'll do if you don't have something

82
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,940
没有事情可想
to occupy your mind.

83
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,110
我的天哪  你说得对
Oh, my God, you're right.

84
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,460
我不在乎价格
I don't care what the cost

85
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,510
以及我在泥里面什么也没穿
or that I'm entirely naked underneath this mud.

86
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,750
我要再加一个小时
I'm getting us another hour.

87
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,820
路易  罗纳德回来
Louis, you are not moving another centimeter

88
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,290
把帘子挂上之前
until Renaldo comes back in here

89
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,440
你一厘米都不要再动了
and puts that privacy curtain back up.

90
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,350
看看谁来了
Oh, look who's here.

91
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,850
我应该要到下午才能出去的
I'm not supposed to get out till this afternoon,

92
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,260
-所以你还剩  -迈克  坐下
- but leave it to you to-- - Mike, sit down.

93
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,890
好吧
Okay.

94
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,450
发生什么事了
What's going on?

95
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,470
卡荷尔打电话说
Cahill called and said

96
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,780
你的释放出了些问题
there was a problem with your release.

97
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,840
不是什么大事  
It's not a big deal,

98
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,340
只是时间要更长一点
but it's just gonna take a little longer.

99
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,710
-还要多长  -还要几天
- How much longer? - A few days.

100
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,180
哈维  我告发了某人
Harvey, I informed on someone.

101
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,000
如果传出去  
If word gets out about that--

102
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,470
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know that?

103
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,810
但他撤销了你的协议  之后又恢复了
But he pulled your deal then reinstated it.

104
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,580
所以时间要长一些
It's gonna take a little time.

105
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,240
那与此同时我要怎么办
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do in the meantime?

106
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,550
老实呆着  保持警惕
Sit tight, and keep your wits about you.

107
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,200
你都坚持了这么久
You made it this long.

108
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,970
多几天一定没问题
You can make it a few more days.

109
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,490
瑞秋知道这件事了吗
Does Rachel know about this?

110
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,930
她本来就不知道
Look, she didn't know it was gonna take this long

111
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,340
你要多久才能出去
in the first place,

112
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,040
我觉得现在也没必要告诉她
and I didn't see the need to tell her now.

113
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,720
那就帮个忙别跟她说了
Do me a favor, and let's keep it that way.

114
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,310
瑞秋  早上好
Rachel, good morning.

115
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,920
我之前还找你来着
I was looking for you before.

116
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,220
我想恭喜你迈克就要出来了
I wanted to say congratulations on getting Mike out.

117
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,210
谢谢
I appreciate that.

118
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,730
但我们还有些别的好消息
But we have some other good news.

119
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,920
我们也许也要把伦纳德・贝利救出来了
We may be on our way to getting Leonard Bailey out too.

120
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,130
你找到方法让法院重审了吗
Did you figure out a way to reopen the trial?

121
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,430
是的
I did.

122
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,130
瑞秋  理论上来说是不错的
Rachel, this is good in theory,

123
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,390
但这没有先例
but there's no precedent.

124
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,750
有的
Yes, there is.

125
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,150
特纳诉密歇根州政府
Turner versus the State of Michigan.

126
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,440
你是怎么找到这个的
How the hell did you find that?

127
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,760
助理做久了
It turns out being a paralegal for so long

128
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,390
会很擅长大海捞针
was a blessing in disguise,

129
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,770
因为没人比我更擅长搜寻线索
because nobody is better at research than me.

130
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,210
非常好  起草一份申诉书
Great. Write up a declaration,

131
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,770
做完尽快交给我
and get it to me as soon as you're done.

132
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,450
接下来的事交给我
And I'll get this thing rolling.

133
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,140
杰西卡  我以为我可以负责做这件事
Jessica, I thought I'd be the one to do it.

134
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,840
瑞秋  你还不是个律师
Rachel, you're not a lawyer yet.

135
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,210
我不用成为律师
I don't need to be.

136
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,100
她是她的公设辩护律师  她会处理的
She's his public defender. She'll do this for us.

137
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,290
听我说  有时事情并不能像计划那样进行
Listen to me--sometimes things don't go exactly as planned.

138
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,660
没人比你更擅长搜寻线索
And nobody is better at research than you,

139
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,030
但没人比我更擅长让事情尘埃落定
but nobody is better at dropping the hammer than me.

140
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,680
听我说  我要问你个问题
Listen to me, I'm gonna ask you a question,

141
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,100
我需要知道真相
and I need to know the truth.

142
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,400
你知道卡荷尔干的好事吗
You know about this Cahill shit?

143
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,540
卡荷尔干什么好事了
What Cahill shit?

144
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,330
很显然萨特无法满足那个混蛋了
Apparently Sutter wasn't enough for that asshole,

145
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,760
因为他冻结了我们的资产
because he's been seizing our assets left and right.

146
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,740
你真的觉得他们会让她
You really think they were gonna let her

147
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,600
留着在进行内幕交易时赚到的直接收益吗
keep direct proceeds from insider trading?

148
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,980
我不是说直接收益
I'm not talking about direct proceeds.

149
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,040
我是说我们拥有的一切
I'm talking about everything we have.

150
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,650
-什么  -没错
- What? - Yeah,

151
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,850
包括她在
including money she earned

152
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,890
被卷入这烂摊子之前挣的钱
before she ever got wrapped up in that bullshit.

153
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,910
他们不能这么做
They can't do that.

154
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,730
但他们正在做
Well, they're doing it.

155
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,380
我不管你在这还是出去以后
And I don't care whether you do something about it

156
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,160
是否要做点什么
from in here or when you get out there,

157
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,360
但是你说服我们签了协议  迈克
but you're the one who convinced us to take this deal, Mike,

158
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,860
所以你最好想办法阻止
so you better damn well be the one to stop it.

159
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,580
大律师
Hey, Counselor.

160
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,520
你没忘了我吧
You didn't forget about me, did you?

161
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,080
你的听证会是明天下午两点
Your hearing's tomorrow at 2:00.

162
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,550
我给你发过文件了
I sent you the paperwork.

163
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,990
正好赶在最后一刻
Right under the wire.

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,230
时间安排得挺紧啊
Cutting it close, huh?

165
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,160
我说过我会弄好的  现在弄好了  加洛
I said I'd get it done, and it's done, Gallo.

166
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,550
-现在我要走了  -这么快
- Now I'm leaving. - So soon?

167
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,390
我以为你要跟我见面谈谈策略的
I thought you might want to meet and chat strategy.

168
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,980
我的策略是明天让你拿到假释
My strategy is for you to get your parole tomorrow

169
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,310
然后把你从我的记忆中抹掉
and then burn your existence from my brain.

170
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,670
我不喜欢你跟你客户的
I don't think I like the way you just spoke

171
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,460
讲话方式  哈维
to your own client, Harvey.

172
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,700
你最好能成功
You better come through.

173
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,870
我会成功的  加洛
I'll come through, Gallo,

174
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,890
但你最好记住你那部分协议
but you better remember your part of the deal.

175
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,560
什么  保护迈克吗
What, protecting Mike?

176
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,940
如果我和他友好相处  他还需要什么保护
What does Mike need protecting for if I'm cool with him?

177
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,930
你少扯淡了
Save your bullshit.

178
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,010
我清楚你知道了迈克一直在告密
I know you know Mike was informing.

179
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,160
没错  我还知道威廉・萨特要完蛋
Yeah, I also know William Sutter's going away,

180
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,420
也就是说迈克要出狱了
which means Mike's getting out.

181
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,700
他还没出来呢
Well, he's not out yet,

182
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,500
既然你俩现在都在里面
so while you're both still in there,

183
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,630
你给我看好他
you don't take your eyes off him.

184
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,910
我向来说话算数
I'm nothing if not a man of my word.

185
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,080
还有哈维  我不想穿这一身
Oh, and Harvey, I don't want to stand

186
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,710
站在假释委员会面前
of the parole board wearing this,

187
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,180
给我带件像样的衣服穿
so bring me something nice to wear.

188
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,390
我进来的时候穿修身版38号
I was a 38 slim when I came in.

189
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,430
现在估计要穿普通版40号
Now I'm more like a 40 reg.

190
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,250
你来决定吧  毕竟你穿的这么讲究
I'll leave it up to you; you're the dandy.

191
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,910
我是肖恩・卡荷尔
This is Sean Cahill.

192
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,530
肖恩  我是迈克・罗斯
Well, Sean, this is Mike Ross.

193
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,520
有什么事吗  迈克
What can I do for you, Mike?

194
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,070
你可以告诉我为什么
You can tell me why the hell

195
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,850
你要冻结吉尔・米勒的资产吗
you're going after Jill Miller's assets.

196
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,020
对不起  我不知道你是她的会计
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware you were her accountant.

197
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,010
如果你不停手的话
Well, if you don't back off,

198
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,690
我就要成她的律师了
I'm about to become her goddamn lawyer.

199
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,270
-你说什么  -她的协议里没有这块
- Excuse me? - That wasn't part of her deal.

200
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,580
是没有  但我不会让她
No, it wasn't, but I'm not gonna let her

201
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,540
拿着通过犯罪得来的钱
keep her money she made committing a crime.

202
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,500
你不只是拿走了她犯罪得来的钱
You're not just taking money she made from a crime.

203
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,640
你把她这些年在公司
You're taking the salary she made

204
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,490
挣的薪水全拿走了
from working at that company for years.

205
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,820
听着  这个女人逃过了坐牢
Listen, that woman got out of going to prison.

206
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,950
但是每次他们买进股票
But every time they took a position,

207
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,620
都会让那些失去了一切的人赔钱
they sold the other side to people who lost everything.

208
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,840
工人们的生活已经毁于一旦了
And I'll be damned if I let her live high on the hog

209
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,930
我能让她滋润地过日子才怪
while working people's lives were ruined.

210
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,210
肖恩  我知道你母亲和西班牙的事情
Sean, I know about your mother and Spain.

211
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,280
但不是吉尔・米勒拿走了她的钱
But Jill Miller didn't take her money.

212
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,770
我不关心  我有能力这么做
I don't care. And I have the power to do this.

213
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,780
谈话结束
And this conversation is over.

214
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,630
杰西卡・皮尔逊
Jessica Pierson.

215
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,870
我秘书本该告诉你我不接新客户了
My secretary should've told you I'm not taking new clients.

216
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,680
这么说你知道我来这里的原因
I take it you know why I'm here.

217
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,450
你的徒弟指责我没有尽责为莱纳德・贝利辩护
I tried to be polite when your protégé accused me

218
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,610
我尽量保持克制
of not doing my job with Leonard Bailey.

219
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,670
但我可不会听一个雇佣冒牌货的人
But I'm not gonna be told by someone who harbored a fraud

220
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,980
说我是多差的一个律师
what a bad lawyer I am.

221
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,950
我认为你不是个坏律师  乔治娜
I don't think you're a bad lawyer, Georgina.

222
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,050
我认为你是一个犯了错的好律师
I think you're a good lawyer that made a mistake.

223
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,210
我来这里是为了给你个机会弥补的
And I'm here to give you a chance to fix it.

224
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,370
说来听听
And how's that?

225
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,010
伦纳德・贝利不在场证明的证人死了
Leonard Bailey's alibi witness is dead.

226
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,210
这不代表她的证词不存在
That doesn't mean her testimony is.

227
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,420
你想让我给她告诉我的事作证吗
You want me to testify to what she told me?

228
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,370
这是道听途说
That would be hearsay.

229
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,960
如果她没死  没错
It would be if she were alive.

230
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,840
但现在她死了
But now that she's dead...

231
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,890
她是个无法传唤的申诉人
She's an unavailable declarant.

232
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,030
如我所说  你是个好律师
Like I said, you are a good lawyer.

233
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,870
我不会假装我曾让一个活生生的证人消失了
And I'm not pretending I let a solid witness disappear

234
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,530
而那个姑娘是个瘾君子
when that girl was a junkie

235
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,560
而她的故事最多也就是前后矛盾
and her story was inconsistent at best.

236
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,530
但仍应该向陪审团陈述这件事
And it still should've been presented to a jury,

237
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,650
这正是我们想修正的
which is what we're trying to fix.

238
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,280
你唯一想修正的就是你的名声
The only thing you're trying to fix is your reputation.

239
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,530
但你不能通过玷污我的名声达到目的
And you're not doing it by smearing mine.

240
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,140
乔治娜  有人命悬一线
Georgina, a man's life is on the line.

241
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,750
可我当初已经尽我所能为他辩护了
And I did my best to defend it,

242
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,930
我现在没有义务再做一遍
but I have no obligation to do it again.

243
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,430
那你就错了
That's where you're wrong.

244
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,030
我徒弟冒昧地起草了一份宣誓证明
My protégé took the liberty of drawing up a sworn affidavit

245
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,170
里面陈述了玛利亚・戈麦斯告诉过你
which states Maria Gomez told you

246
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,860
伦纳德・贝利不可能谋杀了那对夫妻
Leonard Bailey couldn't have murdered that couple

247
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,630
因为他俩当时在一起
because he was with her at the time.

248
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,900
现在你要么签了它
Now you can either sign it,

249
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,160
要么在宣誓后撒谎说这是假的
or you lie under oath that this isn't true.

250
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,890
相信我  你不想在出庭作证时
And believe you me, you do not want to be on that stand

251
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,060
当着我的面向陪审团撒谎
lying to a jury and have to face me.

252
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,740
唐娜  取消我明天所有的预约
Donna, cancel all my meetings tomorrow,

253
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,860
然后告诉假释委员会加洛准备好了
and notify the parole board that Gallo's ready.

254
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,010
-哈维  -我不想听
- Harvey-- - I don't want to hear it.

255
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,070
听我说
Listen to me.

256
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,770
我和你一起把他送进监狱的
I was there with you when you put him away,

257
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,200
如果我不提醒一下你当初你对他的评价的话
and I wouldn't be able to live with myself

258
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,340
我是不会心安理得的
if I didn't remind you what you said about him at the time.

259
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,300
我不需要你提醒
I don't need reminding.

260
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,830
你说过他是一个
You said he was a sociopath

261
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,350
以伤害他人为乐的反社会者
who took pleasure from hurting people.

262
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,680
唐娜  我没有选择的余地
Donna, I don't have a choice.

263
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,080
这是你知道迈克要出狱之前的事
That was before you knew that Mike was getting out.

264
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,500
如果你骗他几个小时
If you just string him along for a couple more hours--

265
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,170
迈克今天出不来了
Mike's not getting out today.

266
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,630
什么
What?

267
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,420
卡荷尔给我打电话了
Cahill called me.

268
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,510
协议需要过几天才能通过
The deal's gonna take a few more days to go through.

269
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,640
如果加洛以为我在骗他
And if Gallo even thinks that I'm stringing him along,

270
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,720
迈克可能永远都出不来了
Mike may never get out of there at all.

271
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,140
我会给你空出时间的
I'll clear your schedule.

272
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,170
我需要和你谈谈
Hey, I need to talk to you.

273
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:24,860
谈之前
Before you do,

274
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,650
我只想说之前我不是
I just want to say i didn't mean to

275
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,520
故意把一切怪罪于你的
put it all on you earlier.

276
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,270
现在这不重要  听着
No, that doesn't matter now. Listen.

277
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,350
你说过当初你被捕时
You said that when you got arrested,

278
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,490
你拒绝了一份供出萨特的协议
you turned down a deal to turn on Sutter.

279
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,800
我需要知道他们是怎么说的
I need to know exactly what they said.

280
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,230
我不明白这和吉尔有什么关系
I don't understand what that has to do with Jill.

281
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,390
没关系
It doesn't.

282
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,110
这和我要把你弄出监狱
It has to do with the fact that

283
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,660
有关系
I'm trying to get you out of here.

284
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,610
什么
What?

285
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,230
钱的事我也许无能为力
I might not be able to do anything about the money,

286
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,450
但也许我能做的
but maybe what I can do

287
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,480
是让你和家人团聚
is make it so that you can be with your family.

288
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,030
不了
No.

289
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,090
-为什么说不  -不用了
- What do you mean, no? - No.

290
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,260
他们已经盯着我们的钱了
They're already going after our money.

291
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,270
我不想让自己的行为
I don't want to do anything

292
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,060
破坏吉尔的协议
that's gonna mess with Jill's deal.

293
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,060
听我说  那个协议已经定死了
Listen to me. That deal is as solid as a rock.

294
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,940
我亲自写的  他们不会对她毁约
I wrote it myself; they can't take it away from her

295
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,660
同样也不会对我毁约的
any more than they can take my deal away from me.

296
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,730
但你要告诉我卡荷尔让你供出萨特时
But you need to tell me exactly what Cahill said to you

297
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,700
到底跟你说了什么
when he told you to turn on Sutter.

298
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,000
什么也没说  他从没对我说过话
Nothing. He never said anything to me.

299
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,310
你说什么
What are you talking about?

300
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,120
我这辈子就没和肖恩・卡荷尔说过话
I'm telling you I've never spoken to Sean Cahill in my life.

301
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,510
我来了
All right, I'm here.

302
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,770
我给了你们七天时间寻找那位证人
But I gave you seven days to find that witness,

303
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,310
可你们却背着我行事
and then you went behind my back,

304
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,490
所以你们最好有充分的理由
so you better have a good reason why you're in here

305
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,930
告诉我为什么要来申请重审
asking to reopen this case.

306
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,820
理由我们有  法官大人  
We do, Your Honor.

307
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,060
我们找到了伦纳德・贝利的不在场证明
We found Leonard Bailey's alibi.

308
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,130
她们找到的只是传闻证据
What they found is nothing but hearsay.

309
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,210
他这话什么意思
What is he talking about?

310
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,250
他的意思是  我们的目击证人
He's talking about the fact that our eyewitness

311
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,580
三年前就去世了
died three years ago,

312
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,040
但贝利先生的原审律师
and Mr. Bailey's original attorney

313
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,100
将会参照特纳诉密歇根州政府案中
is going to testify on her behalf

314
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,050
有关传闻证据例外情况的规定亲自出庭作证
under the Turner v. Michigan exception to the hearsay rule.

315
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,230
那个案子中有一份书面声明
That exception involved a written statement.

316
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,430
的确有书面声明  但我们这也有
It is a written statement, and we have it right here.

317
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,670
那根本不是书面声明
That is not a written statement.

318
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,940
那只是她今早才胡编的
That is a bullshit affidavit

319
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,560
狗屁承诺
she cobbled together this morning.

320
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,720
你指控人家什么
What did you just accuse her of?

321
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,330
抱歉  法官大人  但我觉得这也太凑巧了
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but I find it decidedly convenient

322
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,430
她们提交的证人证言
that they don't have the witness statement

323
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,260
既没写在笔记本或纸上
written down on a notebook or a scrap of paper

324
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,140
也非案发时期证据
from the same decade that it happened.

325
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,180
可我们却觉得这太不凑巧了
Well, we happen to find it decidedly inconvenient.

326
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,280
乔治娜・凯西之所以当时没写下来
And Georgina Casey didn't write it down at the time

327
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,040
是因为她在代理时
because she didn't do an adequate job

328
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,800
没有做充分的准备
representing her client.

329
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,560
你们的意思是本案由于伦纳德・贝利的
Are you now saying that this case needs to be reopened

330
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,480
代理人工作不充分  应予以重审吗
based on Leonard Bailey having inadequate representation?

331
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,290
这可是对律师同仁
Because that is a serious allegation

332
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,780
十分严厉的指控
to make about a fellow attorney.

333
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,370
我们之前没打算这样做
That wasn't our plan.

334
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,490
但如果这样能给他一个机会
But if that's what it takes to give this man a chance

335
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,040
证明他的清白
to prove his innocence,

336
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,820
那我们就一定会这样做
then it sure as hell is our plan now.

337
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,990
真是荒唐
This is ridiculous.

338
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,660
听起来也许荒唐  但如果她们
It may sound ridiculous, but if they were able to get

339
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,440
能让一位知名律师承认重大过错
a successful attorney to admit to a huge blunder,

340
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,940
那我就要裁定此案还是要重新审查
then I'm ruling that this case should be reopened after all.

341
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,930
卡梅隆  你怎么来了
Cameron, what are you doing here?

342
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,900
你知道我为什么来
You know what I'm doing here.

343
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,570
你是不是疯了  给弗兰克・加洛当代理人
Are you out of your goddamn mind representing Frank Gallo?

344
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,380
-你不懂  -我怎么不懂
- You don't understand. - I understand plenty.

345
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,870
-不  听我说  -不  你听我说
- No, listen to me. - No, you listen to me.

346
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,240
那个混蛋是杀人犯
That guy was a murdering piece of shit

347
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,430
应该被关一辈子
who should've been put away for life,

348
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,570
可你现在却想把他捞出来
and now you're trying to get him out?

349
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,450
他跟迈克・罗斯关在一起
He's in there with Mike Ross.

350
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,510
我才不在乎
I don't care.

351
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,660
我在乎  因为如你所言
Well, I do, because like you just said,

352
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,990
那个混蛋的确是杀人犯
he is a murdering piece of shit.

353
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,310
但你不知道的是  我跟他有了约定
But what you don't know is, I made a deal with him,

354
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,260
我也不会打破这个约定
and I'm not gonna break it.

355
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,760
-我会  -这由不得你
- Then I will. - It's not up to you.

356
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,480
我把这个
Well, it will be

357
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,410
在假释裁决委面前一放  就由得我了
when I play this for the parole board.

358
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,080
那是什么
What is that?

359
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,680
录音中他承认了
It's the tape we had of him admitting

360
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,470
是他杀掉了那个你辜负了的人
that he murdered that man that you shit the bed with

361
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,810
且被排除在证据之外
and got excluded from evidence.

362
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,680
我没辜负任何人  这你是知道的
I didn't shit the bed with anything, and you know it.

363
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,870
你要是敢把这东西带到听证会上
You try to bring that bullshit to his hearing,

364
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,260
我就在你按下播放键前给你赶出去
I'll march you out of there before you get to hit play,

365
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,650
之前法庭没有采信
'cause it wasn't admissible in court,

366
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,940
听证会也不会被采信
and it's not admissible there.

367
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,670
你怎么安慰自己都可以
You tell yourself whatever you want,

368
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,310
但我还是要竭尽全力
but I'm gonna do whatever I need to do

369
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,720
不让那家伙走出监狱
to keep that bastard behind bars.

370
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,050
能谈谈吗
Talk to you a second?

371
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,930
没问题
Of course.

372
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,860
你说得对
You were right.

373
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,850
我刚才工作的时候
The whole time I was working,

374
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,400
塔拉和他的事完全没影响到我...
I didn't worry about what Tara was doing with...

375
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,870
也就是说  我人生第一次
him, which meant the first time in my life,

376
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,590
打破了整理收费表时间的记录
I finished the billables in record time.

377
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,870
可现在你却不敢回家了
And now you're afraid to go home.

378
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,860
我会忍不住去想这件事
I can't help wondering what's happening.

379
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,150
路易  你听过那个千斤顶的故事吗
Louis, have you ever heard of a jack story?

380
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,890
-没有  -那你该听听
- No. - Well, it's time you did.

381
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,580
一个人在乡村公路上爆胎了
A man gets a flat tire on a country road.

382
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,160
他看到远处有间房子
He sees a house in the distance.

383
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,590
他走向那栋房子  一边走
He walks up to the house, and along the way,

384
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,060
他一边想  "他们要是没有千斤顶怎么办"
he starts thinking, "What if they don't have a jack?

385
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,130
"如果他们有
"What if they have a jack,

386
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,600
却管我要钱  假如他们要钱
but they want to charge me for it, and if they do,

387
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,920
会管我要多少
How much would they charge?

388
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,880
一百块  两百块还是一千块"
$100, $200, $1,000?"

389
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,430
-都是废话  -没错
- That's bullshit. - Exactly.

390
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,000
他来到房子面前
So by the time the man gets to the house,

391
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,560
按了门铃  里面的人开了门
rings the bell, and they answer the door,

392
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,200
他却跟他们说
he tells them, "You know what?

393
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,930
"留着你那破千斤顶吧"
Keep your goddamn jack."

394
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,410
-真是机智  -明白我要说什么了吗
- That's brilliant. - So you get my point.

395
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,760
没有
No.

396
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,470
路易  你不知道塔拉的想法
Louis, you have no idea what's going on in Tara's mind,

397
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,120
所以最好的办法就是信任她
so the best thing you can do is trust her.

398
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,580
如果不信任她  我敢肯定
Because if you don't, I'm telling you,

399
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,060
你一定会作出
you're gonna do something that you'll regret

400
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,380
让你遗憾终身的事
for the rest of your life.

401
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,330
好吧  唐娜
All right, Donna.

402
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,180
我等塔拉给我打电话
I'll wait for Tara to call.

403
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,350
很好
Okay.

404
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,660
有何贵干
Can I help you?

405
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,340
你能干什么  叛徒
Help me what, rat?

406
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,660
你说什么
What did you just say?

407
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,930
我说你背叛了自己的室友
I said you ratted on your own roommate.

408
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,320
这事都传开了
Word's spreading,

409
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
总有一天  
and there's going to come a time

410
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,250
你也会需要我的保护
when you need my protection,

411
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,000
可我却不会管你的
and I won't be there.

412
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,090
发生什么事了
Hey, what's going on here?

413
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,850
没事
Nothing.

414
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,030
怎么会没事  你刚才在威胁他
It's not nothing. You were threatening him.

415
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,780
你再敢不经过我的许可这么做
You ever do it again without my say so,

416
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,760
我就让你后悔认识了我
you'll regret the day you met me.

417
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,440
对不起  弗兰克
Sorry, Frank.

418
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,010
别担心  小子  有我保护你
Don't worry about it, kid. I got your back.

419
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,130
你才不会
No, you don't.

420
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,490
大家都知道狱警是最后知道这些事的
Everyone knows guards are the last one to find out anything.

421
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,060
所以如果大家真知道了
So if word were spreading,

422
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,000
也不可能是狱警来告诉我
I wouldn't be finding out about it from him.

423
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,710
他这么做是因为听命于你
He just did that because you told him to,

424
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,850
因为你想提醒我如果哈维不把你弄出去
because you want to remind me of what's gonna happen

425
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,680
我会有什么后果
if Harvey lets you down.

426
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,210
那我想你应该理解的很透彻了
Well, then, I guess you got the message loud and clear.

427
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,180
祝我明天听证会顺利吧
Good luck to me on my hearing tomorrow.

428
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,700
我让你办的事办了吗
Did you do what I asked you to do?

429
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,780
-办了  -那最好
- I did. - You better.

430
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,340
因为如果你不说人话
Because if you don't sound like a human being,

431
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,670
那就得继续在这儿待两年
you're gonna be in here for another two years.

432
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,600
卡梅隆・丹尼斯来这儿干什么
The hell is Cameron Dennis doing here?

433
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,910
他的事我来处理
You let me worry about him.

434
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,250
斯佩克特先生  请开始吧
Mr. Specter, please proceed.

435
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,670
听证席的女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen of the board,

436
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,250
加洛先生已经服刑十二年
Mr. Gallo has served 12 years

437
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,190
而且表现良好
as an exemplary inmate.

438
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,530
我们希望您能允许
We ask that you release him

439
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,370
让他在监狱外继续他的生活
so he can continue to live his life outside these walls.

440
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,220
但在决定前
But before you decide on that,

441
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,570
请先听听他自己的陈述
we think it's best if you hear from him in his own words.

442
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,500
你个混蛋  这是什么
You son of a bitch, what the hell is this?

443
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,030
这是代表我的委托人  凯文・米勒提出的动议
It's an action on behalf of my client, Kevin Miller.

444
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,470
你去年找他麻烦是滥用权力的行为
You abused your power when you went after him last year.

445
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,440
我才没有滥用
I didn't abuse shit.

446
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,670
我不敢苟同
I beg to differ.

447
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,740
因为凯文不仅住在新泽西
'Cause not only does Kevin live in New Jersey,

448
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,030
车祸也发生在那里
but his accident was there too,

449
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,100
也就是说你越权管了其他地域的事
which means you were outside of your jurisdiction.

450
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,150
你最好撤回这个动议
You better rescind this suit,

451
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,260
因为如果他们找我的麻烦
because if they come after me--

452
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,080
他们不会找你麻烦的  肖恩
They're not gonna come after you, Sean,

453
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,640
因为我还没有提出
because I haven't filed it yet.

454
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,960
我也不会提出  只要你同意救凯文出去
And I'm not going to, as long as you agree to get Kevin out.

455
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,650
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

456
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,130
-我不会这么做的  -为什么
- I'm not gonna do that. - Why not?

457
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,280
因为我不会被
'Cause I'm not gonna get held hostage

458
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,450
你这种人威胁
by the likes of you.

459
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,200
我想我想表达的是
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

460
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,410
我不能否认我的过去
I'm not denying the person I was

461
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,550
和我干过的事
or the things I did,

462
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,270
因为我确实干了
because I did those things.

463
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,640
如果我能回到过去改变那些事
If I could go back and change what I did,

464
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,790
我一定会的  但我不能
I would, but I can't.

465
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,950
我能做的只是向你们发誓
What I can do is swear to you

466
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,310
我绝不会再成为过去的那个我
that I will never go back to being that person again.

467
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,040
你要拿走吉尔的财产是你过分了
You crossed the line when you took Jill's money.

468
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,100
不  迈克  我没有
No, Mike, I didn't,

469
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,960
但我现在打算过分一下了
but I'm about to cross it now.

470
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,340
你想知道什么是滥用权力是吗  
You want to see abuse of power?

471
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,370
你的协议没了
Your deal is gone.

472
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,220
如果你的陈述做完了
If there are no other statements--

473
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,700
其实  我有话要说
Matter of fact, I would, uh, like to say a few words.

474
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,720
-你是哪位  -卡梅隆・丹尼斯
- And you are? - Cameron Dennis.

475
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,540
我是加洛先生一案当时的检察官
I was the district attorney at the time of Mr. Gallo's trial.

476
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,720
主席先生
Mr. Chairman,

477
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,890
丹尼斯先生要播放的录音带
Mr. Dennis is about to play a tape

478
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,170
是当时庭审的证据
from the original trial.

479
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,910
当时没有被承认
It wasn't admissible then,

480
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,360
现在也无权被承认
and it's not admissible now.

481
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,770
不  哈维  我是要读
No, Harvey, I'm going to read

482
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,720
加洛先生判刑听证会上
the transcript of your own words

483
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,120
你本人的原话记录
from Mr. Gallo's sentencing hearing.

484
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,440
弗兰克・加洛就是个人渣
"Frank Gallo is the scum of the Earth.

485
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,240
他是一个对自己所犯之罪
"He's a sociopath who has no remorse

486
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,570
毫无悔过之心的疯子
"for the things he's done,

487
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,620
他是个应该因为他所犯下的罪行
and he is an animal who deserves to be locked up

488
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,530
被终身监禁的人
for the rest of his miserable life."

489
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,210
我给你的豁免权是免除你被抓前
I gave you immunity for crimes you committed

490
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,750
所犯下的罪行
before you got caught.

491
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,830
但你的认罪协议上称
But your plea agreement says

492
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,920
没有执照的情况下你绝不会再次行使律师权力
you'll never practice law again without a license.

493
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,980
你现在就在监狱里行使着律师权力
You've been practicing law in here,

494
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,980
所以这就是
which means that's a crime

495
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,790
你被抓后的犯罪
that happened after you got caught.

496
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,720
胡扯
Bullshit.

497
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,920
凯文和吉尔知道我不是律师
Kevin and Jill both know that I'm not a lawyer.

498
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,660
你清楚我也清楚
You know that and I know that,

499
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,260
但如果你要斗
but if you fight it,

500
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,770
我就跟你在庭上斗两年
I will argue it in court for the next two years.

501
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,700
要是你不放弃这件事
And if you don't drop this thing,

502
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,970
那么在你刑满前你要能提前出来一天
you'll be lucky if they let you out a day

503
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,710
那都是你走运
before you were supposed to get out anyway.

504
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,860
主席先生  我要说
Mr. Chairman, I'm telling you,

505
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,510
弗兰克・加洛改邪归正了
Frank Gallo has changed.

506
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,710
我向听证席保证他没有
And I'm telling the board he hasn't changed.

507
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,310
他只是在勒索你
He's just trying to blackmail you.

508
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,250
谎话
That's a lie.

509
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,130
那你发誓这不是真的啊
Then take the stand and swear it's not true.

510
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,160
够了
That's enough.

511
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,110
斯佩克特先生  这是保释听证会  不是法庭
Mr. Specter, this is a parole hearing, not a court of law,

512
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,540
但如果他说的话是真的
but if there's any truth to what he's saying,

513
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,690
你必须说出来
we need to know.

514
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,950
那不是真的
It's not true.

515
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,860
很不幸  今天的会议
Unfortunately, this body

516
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,690
无权让你对这句话起誓
doesn't have the authority to swear you in,

517
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,840
但我会确保明天的会议有这个权力
but I'm going to make sure that we will tomorrow.

518
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,800
希望你能认真考虑
I'd like you to think long and hard about

519
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,630
明天要说什么
what you're gonna say then,

520
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,540
因为你必须为明天的话起誓
because you'll be saying it under oath.

521
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,800
迈克  我有事告诉你
Mike, I need to tell you what just happened.

522
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,600
我得先告诉你我这边的事
I need to tell you what happened first.

523
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,410
滥用权力  你疯啦
Abuse of power? Are you nuts?

524
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,610
我别无选择
It's the only play I have.

525
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,970
你唯一的选择是等待释放证明
Your only play is to walk out of here

526
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,340
然后离开这里
when your release comes through,

527
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,280
不是威胁要释放你的人
not threaten the guy who made that happen.

528
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,000
听着
Listen to me.

529
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,320
卡荷尔要冻结他们的个人财产
Cahill is seizing their personal assets.

530
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,150
他就是要一砖一砖拆了他们的房子
Yeah, I don't care if he takes their house apart

531
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,000
我也不在乎
brick by brick.

532
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,790
哈维  要不是卡荷尔凯文根本就
Harvey, Kevin wouldn't even be in here in the first place

533
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,850
不会进来
if it weren't for Cahill.

534
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,190
不  迈克  凯文进来
No, Mike, Kevin wouldn't be here

535
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,080
是因为该告发萨特的时候他自己没这么做
if he had chosen to roll over on Sutter in the first place.

536
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,130
而且多亏他没这么做
And it's a good thing he didn't,

537
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,680
否则你就得和加洛一起
because you'd be stuck in here with Gallo

538
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,660
被困在这儿两年了
for the next two years.

539
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,750
我不在意加洛
I don't care about Gallo.

540
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,770
你得在意一下  因为他还没出去
Well, you should, because he's not out yet,

541
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,300
而且有卡梅隆・丹尼斯在
and if it's up to Cameron Dennis,

542
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,740
他恐怕出不去了
he's not getting out.

543
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,190
什么
What?

544
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,420
卡梅隆听说了我给加洛争取保释的事
Cameron got wind that I'm trying to get Gallo parole.

545
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,110
现在我得想办法
And now I got to think of something

546
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,680
或者明天做伪证
or perjure myself tomorrow,

547
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,360
否则他就得坐穿牢底了
or he's gonna end up right back in here.

548
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,130
那我们就更不能把凯文留在里面了
Well, that's even more reason why we can't leave Kevin behind.

549
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,880
如果加洛出不去  我出去了
If Gallo doesn't get out and I do,

550
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,320
他第一个要报复的就是凯文
the first person he's gonna go after is Kevin.

551
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,820
我同意这件事时可不知道会有人被害死
And I didn't sign on to get someone killed.

552
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,620
不  你同意的是让你自己出狱
No, you signed on to get yourself out.

553
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,600
现在如果你不放弃这桩诉讼的话
Now if you don't drop this suit,

554
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,700
卡荷尔一定会威胁取消交易
Cahill's gonna threaten to pull your deal.

555
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,850
怎么了
What?

556
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,760
他已经这么做了
He already did.

557
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,650
那我们还这么讨论的意义何在
Then why are we still having this conversation?

558
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,220
因为我说了  我手上只剩下
Because like I said, this is the only card

559
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,600
这招可用了
I have left to play.

560
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,190
所以如果你要我放弃这个
So if you want me to drop this,

561
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,820
你要让卡荷尔秉持正义把凯文弄出去
you get Cahill to do the right thing and get Kevin out.

562
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,830
我不得不说  作为一个主修公司法的律师
I have to say, for someone who practices corporate law,

563
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,000
你可以说是深谙上诉法院之道
you know your way around an appeals court.

564
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,800
谢谢
Thank you,

565
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,760
但是你来这里的目的应该不是想招募我吧
but you're not here to offer me a job as a prosecutor,

566
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,250
你是来给伦纳德・贝利交易机会的
you're here to offer Leonard Bailey a deal.

567
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,900
-所以切入正题吧  -面对现实吧
- So let's get to it. - Let's face it.

568
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,480
你或许拿到了他原律师的宣誓书
You may have that affidavit from his original attorney,

569
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,910
然而你没有DNA  没有不在场证人
but you have no DNA, no alibi,

570
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,390
而且我猜其他证据你也根本没有
and I'm guess not a hell of a lot else.

571
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,750
我有的  拉里
What I have, Larry,

572
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,680
就是一个它每多拖一天
is a case that will embarrass you personally

573
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,780
你就越颜面扫地的案子
every day it drags on,

574
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,030
因为当初让它上庭的律师就是你
because you were the one that tried it in the first place.

575
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,670
所以赶紧给个刑期  别耽误我工作
So give me a number, so I can get on with my day.

576
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,470
贝利再蹲十年牢  我们皆大欢喜
Bailey does ten more years, and we all go home.

577
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,870
你说十年  其实心理预期是九年吧
When you say ten, you mean nine,

578
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,460
而且你我都清楚我能压到七年
and we both know I can get you down to seven,

579
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,760
所以就五年吧
so let's just say five.

580
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,090
但是我这么说吧
But I'll tell you what.

581
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,540
如果你让他现在就出狱的话
You let my client walk right now,

582
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,960
你的梦想就能实现
and you get your dream.

583
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,250
我们可以不重开此案
We don't open this case at all.

584
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,240
没门儿
No way.

585
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,600
七年刑期  爱要不要
Seven years, take it or leave it.

586
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,760
24小时内给我答复
Offer's good 24 hours.

587
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,710
不  我们不能接受
No, this is unacceptable.

588
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,970
这是你能得到的最好交易
Well, it's the best you're gonna do.

589
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,560
不  最好的交易是让我的委托人
No, the best I'm going to do

590
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,380
因为一个他没有犯下的罪行
is get my client exonerated

591
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,000
被无罪释放
from a crime he didn't commit

592
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,740
并让你颜面扫地
and make you look like a fool.

593
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,970
那放马过来
Then bring it on.

594
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,550
但法律层面讲你必须把交易条件告知委托人
But you're legally obligated to present my offer to your client.

595
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,410
并且提醒他  如果他这次再输
And remind him, if he loses again,

596
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,370
六十天后他就没命了
in 60 days his life is over.

597
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,000
谢谢  比尔
Thanks, Bill.

598
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,000
肖恩  迈克的交易怎么回事
Sean, what's going on with Mike's deal?

599
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,920
啥
Excuse me?

600
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,280
它怎么还没有被批准
Why hasn't it come through yet?

601
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,460
大概是文件处理过程耽搁了吧
Oh, there must've been a mix-up in the paperwork.

602
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,550
扯淡
Bullshit.

603
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,650
你把它延后了是因为他威胁说要告你
You're holding it up because he's threatening to sue you.

604
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,580
对  你说得没错
Oh, you're right. I am.

605
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,350
而且如果他不撤诉并答应不再搅和这事
And if doesn't drop this thing and agree to walk away,

606
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,300
我就把他的交易作废
I'm gonna dump his deal altogether.

607
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,910
肖恩  通过他的交易吧
Sean, let his deal go through.

608
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,650
一旦他出狱
Once he gets out,

609
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,430
他不会把这件事跟进到底的
he's not gonna follow through on this thing.

610
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,840
噢  肖恩  你别威胁他
"Oh, Sean, put down your gun.

611
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,770
我保证迈克不威胁你
"I promise Mike'll put his down too.

612
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,030
而且我们的言辞值得信任
"And you can trust the both of us,

613
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,040
因为我们以前从来没对你撒过谎
'cause neither of us has ever lied to you before."

614
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,360
如果你不信任我们
If you didn't trust us,

615
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,540
从一开始你就不会来找我
you never would've come to me in the first place.

616
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,150
如果我一早就知道结局如此
If I had known this is how it was going to end,

617
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,120
我就不会找你们
I never would have.

618
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,250
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

619
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,270
你要什么我们都他妈给你摆平了
We got you every goddamn thing you wanted.

620
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,610
你们对我的要求我也做到了
I held up my end of the bargain,

621
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,950
更别提我还帮吉尔・米勒要到了豁免
not to mention the fact I gave immunity to Jill Miller

622
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,040
而我根本不用做到这个程度
when I didn't have to.

623
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,200
瞎扯淡你说你根本不用做到这个程度
Bullshit you didn't have to.

624
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,800
她帮你赢了案子
She made your case,

625
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,530
而且是迈克冒着生命危险帮你争取到她的
and Mike risked his life to get her for you.

626
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,470
为了让我把那孩子弄出狱
You had no problem asking me

627
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,440
你让我冒多大险眼都不眨一下
to risk everything to get that kid out,

628
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,330
而我也这么做了
and I did it.

629
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,480
现在你这个过河拆桥的混蛋
And now that ungrateful son of a bitch

630
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,690
居然想反咬一口
wants to bite the hand that feeds him,

631
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,300
我打算直接把他晚餐撤掉
I'm gonna take away his dinner

632
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,950
告诉他谁才是他主子
and show him who his master is.

633
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,600
肖恩  拜托你了
Sean, please.

634
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,470
加洛有可能要继续坐牢的
Gallo might not get out,

635
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,490
迈克就得陪着他坐穿牢底
and Mike's gonna be stuck in there with him.

636
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,440
这更有理由让他不要再找我麻烦
Well, all the more reason he should put down his gun

637
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,780
乖乖出狱了
and walk out that f---ing door.

638
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,360
杰西卡  进来吧
Jessica, come in.

639
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,320
抱歉我突然就这么过来了
I'm sorry to drop by unannounced,

640
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,710
但是我有要事要和你谈
but I need to talk to you.

641
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,420
不不  我很抱歉是我早退了
No, no, I'm sorry that I had to leave a little bit early.

642
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,970
我只是想在迈克回来前把家收拾好
I just wanted to get the place ready for when Mike gets home.

643
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,750
那我长话短说
Then I won't take up much of your time.

644
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,560
他们给了伦纳德・贝利一个交易
They offered Leonard Bailey a deal.

645
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,680
-多长时间  -七年
- How long? - Seven years.

646
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,630
但是我也许能把刑期减到五年
But I can probably get them down to five.

647
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,640
再为他没犯过的罪蹲多五年牢
Five more years for a crime he didn't commit

648
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,890
正义并没有得到伸张啊
doesn't seem really fair.

649
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,040
然而输掉一个二审
And losing a retrial

650
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,210
最后横死狱中也不公平啊
and dying in prison doesn't seem fair either.

651
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,480
-但我们并不一定会输  -不是的
- But we're not gonna lose. - That's not true.

652
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,600
我们有很大几率会输
There's a good chance we will.

653
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,930
-杰西卡  -瑞秋
- Jessica-- - Rachel.

654
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,790
陪审团捉摸不定的
Juries are unpredictable.

655
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,900
即使他们被要求无视之前的情况
Even if they'd been told to disregard something,

656
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,180
他们也心里清楚他曾经被判有罪过
they know he was convicted before.

657
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,140
这是一个让他能够死里逃生的机会
This is a chance at getting his life back.

658
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,960
那他劫后余生的生活又会是如何呢
What kind of life are we talking about?

659
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,570
他仍然会被看作是一个罪犯
He's still going to be seen as a murderer

660
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,750
甚至他最亲的母亲一样的人都会这么认为
even by the closest thing he has to a mother.

661
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,180
那我也不能让他为一个不是他的罪行被杀
I'm not gonna let him die for a crime he didn't commit.

662
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,330
我也不想让他死啊
I don't want to let him die either.

663
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,400
我想争取救他出狱
I want to fight to get him out.

664
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,820
然而我不认为你有足够的经验
And I don't think you've been practicing law long enough

665
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,130
做出这个判断
to make that call.

666
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,810
瑞秋  这对他来说已经是胜利了
Rachel, this is a win for him.

667
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,130
摆正心态
So get your mind right

668
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,930
我们到牢里必须统一论调
so that we can walk into that prison on the same page.

669
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,060
哈维  除非你来这里是告诉我
Harvey, unless you're here to tell me

670
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,990
你想通了释放这个畜生是不对的
you've come to your senses about this animal,

671
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,980
否则我们没什么话说
this is gonna be a short conversation.

672
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,450
我是来给你这个的
I came here to show you this.

673
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,910
这是什么
What is this?

674
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,850
这是一份来自全国最好的
It's a three-year surveillance agreement

675
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,570
侦探事务所的3年监视协议
with the best detective agency in the state.

676
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,300
你凭什么认为仅仅由于你对他进行了监视
And what makes you think just because you follow him,

677
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,490
就能阻止他继续犯罪了呢
it's gonna stop him from committing crimes?

678
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,410
卡梅隆  我不能让他跟迈克待在同一座监狱
Cameron, I can't have him in there with Mike.

679
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,270
据我耳闻  迈克要出狱了
Well, from what I heard, Mike's getting out.

680
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,570
没那么简单
It's not that simple.

681
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,190
你这话什么意思  没那么简单
What do you mean, it's not that simple?

682
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,470
证监会对迈克的狱友  也就是帮他脱狱的人
The SEC pulled some shady shit with Mike's cellmate,

683
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,460
耍了些阴险的手段
the same guy that helped get Mike out in the first place.

684
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,390
现在迈克在跟他们叫板
Now Mike's been playing chicken with them,

685
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,830
如果他不放弃
and if he doesn't drop it,

686
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,460
他们是不会让他出狱的
they're not gonna let him out.

687
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,080
让我先搞搞清楚
Let me get this straight.

688
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,910
你想让我作伪证
You want me to perjure myself

689
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,580
这样你就能把这个禽兽弄出监狱
so you can put this monster on the street

690
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,590
因为你的死党想要对抗当局
because your sidekick wants to fight The Man?

691
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,100
别跟我玩这套
Don't play that shit with me.

692
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,870
你不守规矩这么多年了
You've been crossing lines for years,

693
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,590
你连一分钟都没有失眠过
and you didn't lose a minute's sleep over it.

694
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,550
你说的对极了我没有
You're damn right I didn't,

695
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,330
因为我是为了把加洛这样的家伙关起来
because I was doing it to put guys like Gallo away,

696
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,220
而不是让他们晚上在外游荡
not let them wander around at night

697
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,090
仅仅指望某个拿着拍立得的胖子
hoping some fat guy with a Polaroid

698
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,940
确保他们不去谋杀其他人
is gonna keep him from murdering somebody else.

699
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,210
那如果他要谋杀的那个人是我呢
And what if that person he was gonna be murdering was me?

700
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,920
因为迈克对于我来说
Because Mike is to me

701
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,000
就是你眼中曾经的我
what I used to be to you.

702
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,060
那就说服他去做正确的事
Then convince him to do the right thing

703
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,980
就像你曾经说服我一样
like you tried to do once with me.

704
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,240
因为  哈维
Because, Harvey,

705
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,840
你知道你为加洛做的事是错的
you know what you're doing with Gallo is wrong.

706
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,510
你不会相信这事的
You're not gonna believe this,

707
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,280
但瑞秋打来找你了
but I got Rachel on the phone for you.

708
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,560
-什么  -没错
- What? - Yeah.

709
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,690
她那天晚上拿到了我的号码
She had my number from the other night,

710
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,920
她想跟你聊聊
and she wants to talk to you.

711
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,970
谢谢
Thanks.

712
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,990
还有迈克  如果你是为了我留在这里
And Mike, if you're staying in here for me,

713
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,150
别这么做
don't do it.

714
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,120
上帝啊  我等不及想见你了
God, I can't wait to see you.

715
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,670
我也等不及想见你了
I can't wait to see you either.

716
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,400
你还好吗
Are you okay?

717
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,790
是的  我
Yeah, I, um--

718
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,120
我只是想跟你聊聊我那个死刑委托人
I just wanted to talk to you about my death row client.

719
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,990
要我怎么帮忙
How can I help?

720
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,570
他们给我们提供了一份协议
They offered us a deal

721
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,030
让他在5年后出狱
for him to get out in five years,

722
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,720
杰西卡想接下来
and Jessica wants to take it.

723
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,710
但我想为他搏一下
But I want to fight for him.

724
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,620
让我猜猜  她想统一战线
Let me guess, she wants to present a united front.

725
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,080
是的
She does.

726
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,650
我不确定我还能怎么帮你
Well, I'm not sure how I can help you

727
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,950
我想我只能告诉你相信自己
other than to tell you to follow your gut.

728
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,000
你可以让我理解坐牢是种怎样的体验
You can help me understand what it's like to be in prison.

729
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,750
你最好表现得令人信服
You better be convincing out there.

730
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,220
加洛  为了让我们之间扯平
Gallo, I'm about to sell my soul

731
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,460
我都要出卖自己的灵魂了
to make us even,

732
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,040
所以你给我坐下  闭嘴
so sit down, shut up,

733
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,510
以及确保今天之后
and make sure that after today,

734
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,980
我再也看不到你这张脸
I never see your face again.

735
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,380
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter.

736
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,120
你准备好宣誓了吗
Are you ready to be sworn in?

737
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,620
假释委员会的各位女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen of the board,

738
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,990
在斯佩克特先生发表证词之前
before Mr. Specter testifies,

739
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,660
我想代表当局
I'd like to present Michael Ross

740
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,600
引入迈克尔・罗斯作为证人
as a witness on behalf of the state.

741
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,320
主席先生  这次听证会被召集的原因是
Mr. Chairman, this hearing was called

742
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,930
以便我能
so that I could--

743
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,340
你会有机会发表意见的  斯佩克特先生
You'll get your chance, Mr. Specter.

744
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,540
我想听听这位年轻人想说点什么
I'd like to hear what the young man has to say.

745
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,030
我可以让他宣誓
I can have him sworn in.

746
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,680
没这个必要
That won't be necessary.

747
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,830
罗斯先生  你是丹伯里联邦监狱的一位犯人
Mr. Ross, you are an inmate here at Danbury,

748
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,570
这个说法正确吗
is that correct?

749
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,710
是的  我因为无证从事律师执业
Yes, I'm serving a two-year sentence

750
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,430
正在服两年的刑期
for practicing law without a license.

751
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,160
你此前在哪家律所工作
And what firm did you work at?

752
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,150
我为斯佩克特先生工作
I worked for Mr. Specter.

753
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,270
你知道最初就是斯佩克特先生
Are you aware that Mr. Specter

754
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,650
起诉的弗兰克・加洛吗
originally prosecuted Frank Gallo?

755
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,810
是的  我知道
Yes, I am.

756
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,300
是谁告诉你这件事的
And who made you aware of it?

757
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,310
弗兰克・加洛
Frank Gallo did.

758
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,160
他是随便顺带提起了这事吗
He just mentioned something in passing?

759
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,000
不
No.

760
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,000
不是  我来这的第一晚
No, on my first night here,

761
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,190
加洛先生贿赂了一位狱警
Mr. Gallo bribed a guard

762
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,400
这样他就能到我牢房里来
so that he could get into my cell,

763
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,210
然后他假装是我同监室的狱友
and then he pretended to be my roommate.

764
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,260
在获得我的信任之后
And after getting me to trust him,

765
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,660
他才告诉我说从他坐牢
he told me that he had been trying

766
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,100
第一天起他就一直在想办法
to get revenge on Harvey Specter

767
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,640
向哈维・斯佩克特复仇
since the day he'd been put away.

768
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,250
然后他告诉我他现在要通过找我麻烦
Then he told me that now he was gonna get revenge on Harvey

769
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,510
来向哈维复仇
by coming after me.

770
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,700
你清楚他说的"找你麻烦"是什么意思吗
Was it clear to you what he meant by "coming after you"?

771
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,340
他说他要杀了我
He said he would kill me.

772
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,960
事实上  第二天晚上他就拿刀来杀我
In fact, he tried to shiv me the second night,

773
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,270
但被一位狱警阻止了
but a guard stopped him.

774
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,080
再问一个问题
Just one more question.

775
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,030
斯佩克特知道你受到的这些威胁吗
Was Mr. Specter aware of these threats?

776
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,980
他当然知道
Of course he was.

777
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,620
不然你觉得他为什么想保释加洛
Why else do you think he's been trying to get Gallo parole?

778
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,420
谢谢  罗斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Ross.

779
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,140
斯佩克特先生  你准备宣誓
Mr. Specter, are you prepared

780
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,220
驳回这些证词吗
to refute this testimony under oath?

781
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,690
不  法官大人
No, Your Honor.

782
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,140
我不准备
I'm not.

783
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,410
休庭5分钟
We'll take a five-minute recess.

784
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,240
你是故意的
You did this.

785
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,190
你一直都跟他串通一气
You were in on it with him the whole time.

786
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,900
你说对了  我是故意的
You're right. I did.

787
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,210
所以你有事冲着我来  别找他麻烦
So you come after me, not him.

788
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,450
我会冲着你们两个来
I'm coming after both of you,

789
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,100
但我会先找他麻烦
but I'm coming after him sooner.

790
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,100
你躲不过我的
Hey, you can't hide from me.

791
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,040
我不需要躲你
Oh, I don't need to hide from you,

792
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,070
因为我今天就要出狱了
'cause it turns out I'm getting out today.

793
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,090
对此你无能为力
And there's nothing you can do about it.

794
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,410
5年还是挺长一段时间
Five years is still a long time.

795
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,070
是的  没错
Yes, it is.

796
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,870
但你出狱之后就自由了
But then you walk out of here a free man.

797
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,630
自由了  但并不是无辜的
A free man, but not an innocent one.

798
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,170
你仍然是无辜的  伦纳德
You're still innocent, Leonard,

799
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,920
不管这个世界怎么看
whether the world sees it that way or not.

800
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,320
但如果整个世界都认为我是个有罪的杀人犯
But if the world thinks I'm a convicted murderer,

801
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,310
那还不如让我死在这里
then I might as well die in here,

802
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,280
因为外面根本没有我的容身之地
because there's not gonna be a life out there for me anyway.

803
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,030
没人说过那很轻松
No one said it was going to be easy.

804
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,210
但为你没犯过的罪而死
But there's no point in dying for a crime

805
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,070
是毫无意义的
you didn't commit.

806
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,420
我觉得你没搞明白
I don't think you understand.

807
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,950
我做这件事不是为了活下去
I'm not doing this just to stay alive.

808
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,080
我是为了有一天当我敲开我孩子的家门
I'm doing this so one day I can knock on my kid's door,

809
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,360
他们能知道他们的爸爸是无辜的
and they'll know their father is an innocent man.

810
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,200
若我接受这个交易  这个愿望就没法实现了
If I take this deal, that's never gonna happen.

811
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,500
如果你不接受
If you don't take it,

812
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,140
它也很可能没法实现
it may never happen either.

813
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,930
你今天话很少  你怎么看
You're pretty quiet. What do you think?

814
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,250
我认为
I--I think that Jessica

815
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,420
杰西卡比我更有经验
has a lot more experience than I do.

816
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,270
我没问你这个
That's not what I asked you.

817
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,920
我想知道你认为我该做什么
I want to know what you think I should do.

818
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,610
伦纳德  你出去的可能性
Leonard, the odds of you getting out--

819
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,750
我说了我想听她的想法
I said I want to know what she thinks.

820
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,860
我觉得你该继续抗争
I think you should fight.

821
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,290
那我就这么做
Then that's what I'm going to do.

822
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,920
该死  我说过我们要站在统一口径的
Goddamn it, I said we need to be on the same page.

823
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,250
他问我怎么想
He asked me what I thought.

824
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,740
我不能对他撒谎
I'm not gonna lie to him.

825
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,070
我真没想到罗伯特・赞恩的女儿
I never would've thought Robert Zane's daughter

826
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,460
会这么天真
would be so naive.

827
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,650
天真
Naive?

828
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,310
我刚开始要相信
I was actually starting to believe

829
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,140
你是真的在乎这个案子
that you cared about this case,

830
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,920
但你唯一关心的就是
but the only thing that you care about

831
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,100
把它赶紧了结
is putting it to bed as quickly as possible.

832
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,130
你还真敢说啊
How dare you?

833
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,420
权衡利弊不等于不关心
Playing the odds isn't the same as not caring.

834
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,070
也许是这样  但杰西卡
Maybe not, but Jessica,

835
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,280
从我工作开始就一直在你身边
I have watched you my whole career,

836
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,740
这是第一次在面对战斗时
and this is the first time that you've ever

837
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,080
你选择逃避
backed away from a fight.

838
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,390
那是因为你从来没有看到过
That's because you've never seen me fight

839
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,170
我为某个命悬一线的人战斗
when someone's life is on the line.

840
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,480
-你  -没错
-You-- - That's right.

841
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,790
我以前也遇到过这种情况
I was in a situation like this once before.

842
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,120
我当时的做法和你现在希望的一样
I did what you want me to do now.

843
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,660
结果我们输了  那件事让我痛彻心扉
We lost, and it ripped me to shreds.

844
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,540
所以当我告诉你我的经验远比你多时
So when I tell you I have a lot more experience than you,

845
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,700
你要相信我
believe it.

846
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,570
杰西卡  我很遗憾
Jessica, I'm sorry...

847
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,830
你之前输过一个这样的案子
that you lost a case like this before.

848
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,040
但要帮助伦纳德不该是去说服他
But the way to help Leonard is not to convince him

849
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,910
接受一个让他活着也了无意义的交易
to take some deal that he can't live with.

850
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,610
而是应该去争取他愿意为之活下去的东西
It is to fight to give him something worth living for.

851
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,990
你都干了些什么
What the hell did you do?

852
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,990
我只是说到做到
I did what I said I'd do.

853
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,710
我要让那个禽兽继续待在牢里
I kept that animal behind bars.

854
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,320
我说的是迈克
I'm talking about Mike.

855
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,900
你跟他达成了交易  对吧
You cut a deal with him, didn't you?

856
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,550
不是  哈维  是他和我达成了交易
No, Harvey, he cut a deal with me.

857
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,230
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

858
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,320
你告诉他我也卷入其中之后
After you told him I was involved with this thing,

859
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,940
他就给我打电话问我能不能
he called me and asked if I could do something

860
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,930
帮帮他的朋友
about his friend Kevin.

861
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,900
我说我会想想办法
I said I'd look into it,

862
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,850
但要他替我做件事
but he'd have to do something for me.

863
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,570
所以你就胡乱承诺
And so you made some bullshit promise with him

864
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,880
骗他这么做
in exchange for doing that.

865
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,870
我没乱说
It wasn't bullshit.

866
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,000
我不替美国证监会工作  哈维
I don't work for the SEC, Harvey.

867
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,810
我把真正的罪犯送进监狱
I put away real criminals.

868
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,420
这个把凯文・米勒送进监狱的人
And the person who put away Kevin Miller

869
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,930
知道只要能把一个谋杀犯关在监狱里
knows that it's worth it to let a drunk driver out,

870
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,680
去释放一个酒驾司机还是值得的
as long as it means keeping a murderer in.

871
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,830
然后就不管迈克会怎么样了是吗
And to hell with what happens to Mike.

872
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,630
他做这件事的时候就知道后果
Hey, he went in there with his eyes wide open,

873
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,590
而且加洛根本没法对他下手
and Gallo can't do anything to him anyway,

874
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,470
因为他今晚就出来了
because he's getting out tonight.

875
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,240
你还不懂是吗
Don't you get it?

876
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,460
迈克今晚就不安全
Mike's not gonna be safe tonight

877
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,510
以后也不会了  因为加洛不管在不在牢里
or any other night, because Gallo can get to him

878
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,160
都能找上他
whether he's behind bars or not.

879
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,040
就像我说的  哈维
Well, like I said, Harvey,

880
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,830
他自己本来就清楚后果
he knew what he was getting into,

881
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,940
但他还是找了我
and he came to me.

882
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,580
你一整天都去哪了
Hey, where you been all day?

883
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,670
履行我的诺言
Been doing what I said I was gonna do.

884
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,470
我要把你弄出去
I'm getting you out.

885
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,320
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

886
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,940
我看起来像是开玩笑吗
Do I look like I'm kidding?

887
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,590
那就拿起电话  打给吉尔
So take that phone of yours, call Jill,

888
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,020
告诉她你马上就回家了
and tell her you're coming home--

889
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,160
就在今晚
tonight.

890
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,420
我都不敢相信
I don't believe it.

891
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,670
你真的把我弄出狱了
You really did that for me?

892
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,270
是的
I did.

893
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
那你呢
What about you?

894
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,280
我和你一起走
I'm getting out with you.

895
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,020
什么
What?

896
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,640
我只是不敢相信我今晚就能给孩子盖被子
I just can't believe I'm gonna be tucking my kids

897
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,910
哄他们上床睡觉
into bed tonight.

898
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,600
我不敢相信我就要见到瑞秋了
I can't believe I'm gonna see Rachel.

899
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,430
我真的不胜感激  迈克
I can't thank you enough, Mike.

900
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,330
好了  我们走吧
All right, let's go.

901
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,500
也是够慢的
It's about time.

902
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,000
没有你  罗斯  只有米勒
Not you, Ross. Just Miller.

903
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,380
什么  你说什么呢
What? What are you talking about?

904
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,950
我也要出去的
I'm getting out too.

905
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,150
我在服从命令  我得到的命令就是带他出去
I'm following orders, and my orders are to bring him out.

906
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,050
不是你
Not you.

907
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,220
这是你干的
You did this.

908
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,690
我什么都没干
I didn't do shit.

909
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,030
但我绝对会好好利用下这个机会的
But I sure as hell am gonna take advantage of it.

910
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,150
迈克不走我也不走
I'm not leaving without Mike.

911
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,270
你必须走
Yeah, you are.

912
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,490
而且我不管是不是得亲手把你从这
And I don't care if I have to drag your ass

913
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,960
一路拖出去
out of here myself.

914
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,780
你现在就得走
You're leaving right now.

915
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,270
哈维  很好  你来了
Harvey, good, you're here.

916
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,190
到底怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

917
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,570
你说如果迈克撤诉
You said you'd reinstate the deal

918
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,840
你就恢复交易
if Mike dropped his suit.

919
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,970
-我做到了  -胡说
- And I did. - Bullshit.

920
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,330
你撤销他的交易  现在他一个人在牢里
You pulled his deal, and now he's in there all alone.

921
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:51,940
要是你现在不拿起电话
Now if you don't pick up the phone--

922
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,210
哈维  我没撤销什么交易
Harvey, I didn't pull anything.

923
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,510
-什么  -迈克打给我
- What? - Mike called me.

924
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,700
他让我把他的文书工作推迟
He told me to hold off his paperwork

925
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,640
直到明天早晨
until tomorrow morning.

926
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,290
那他为什么要那么做呢  肖恩
Why the hell would he do that, Sean?

927
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,290
因为他有个计划  而且不希望你知道
Because he has a plan, and he didn't want you to know.

928
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,090
我不在乎他的计划是什么  你
I don't care what his plan is. You--

929
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,770
听着  他不想你知道  ?是因为他不希望
Listen, he doesn't want you to know, because he didn't

930
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,320
你阻止他  现在你已经无法阻止他了
want you to stop it, and now that you can't,

931
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,390
所以我们得一起帮他搞定这件事
he's gonna need our help to bring it home.

932
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,780
谢谢你  金波
Thanks, Jimbo.

933
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,640
能不能麻烦你  我想和迈克
Why don't you go ahead and give me and Mike here

934
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,030
单独谈谈
a little privacy?

935
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,770
你想怎样  加洛
What do you want, Gallo?

936
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,970
你在我的假释听证会上
That's a stupid question

937
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,610
说了那些话后  现在居然还问我想干嘛
after what you pulled at my parole hearing.

938
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,000
-你不应该被假释  -你也一样
- You didn't deserve to get out. - Neither did you.

939
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,500
而且你现在没机会了
And now you're not gonna.

940
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,800
怎么  你要让我死在牢房里吗
What, you're gonna kill me in this cell?

941
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,410
外面有警卫
There are guards out there.

942
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,430
你还是不明白  是么
It just doesn't sink in for you, does it?

943
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,490
那些警卫都是我的人
Those guards out there work for me.

944
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,080
懂吗  迈克  我不会让上次的事情
See, Mike, I wasn't gonna let what happened last time

945
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,500
再次重演
happen this time.

946
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,070
这次不会再有人在最后一刻来救你了
No one's gonna come run helping you at the last second,

947
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,960
因为他们都被关在狱室里
because they're all locked up tight in their bunks.

948
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,920
讽刺的是
And irony of ironies,

949
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,660
因为很久以前的什么罪犯人权诉讼
because of some prisoners' rights lawsuit way back when,

950
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,380
所以牢房内都没有监控
there are no cameras in cells.

951
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,050
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

952
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,300
等待已经结束了
No, the time for waiting is done.

953
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,250
不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no.

954
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,430
你难道不想知道这里有监控吗
I meant, don't you want to hear about the camera that's in here?

955
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,370
-胡说  -笑一个  混蛋
- Bullshit. - Smile, you son of a bitch.

956
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,560
不
No!

957
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,060
你不会留下来就是为了这个吧
You did not keep yourself in here just to do this.

958
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,460
是的  弗兰克  就是为了这个
Yeah, Frank, I did.

959
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,440
现在  那些没被你收买的警卫
And now all those guards that aren't in your pocket--

960
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,050
都在看着呢
they're watching this right now.

961
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,480
警卫站离这间牢房六十英尺
And it's 60 feet from that guard station to this cell,

962
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,460
如果我算的没错的话
so if I calculated correctly,

963
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,780
他们已经铐住了金波
they've got Jimbo in cuffs,

964
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,050
现在应该来开门了
and they're gonna be opening that door right now.

965
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,040
放下刀  退后  加洛
Drop that knife and step back, Gallo.

966
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,890
你这个垃圾
Oh, you piece of shit!

967
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,990
你还是死定了
Doesn't change anything.

968
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,730
呵呵  咱们走着瞧
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll see about that.

969
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,730
路易
Louis?

970
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,050
塔拉
Tara.

971
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,780
我从来没发现这里晚上原来这么美
I've never seen how beautiful it is in here at night.

972
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,980
美吗
Beautiful.

973
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,160
我想跟你说说今天的事
I want to tell you what happened.

974
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,870
请说
Please.

975
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,640
约书亚之所以会来
The reason Joshua came to town

976
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,850
是因为我告诉了他你的事
is that I told him about you--

977
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,110
我们的事
about us.

978
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,140
所以你和他分手了吗
So did you break up with him?

979
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,340
路易  他向我求婚了
Louis, he asked me to marry him.

980
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,010
你的回答呢
And what'd you say?

981
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,360
我跟他说
I told him...

982
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,040
我不能嫁给他
I couldn't marry him

983
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,430
因为我对另一个男人有着特殊的感觉
while I felt this way about another man.

984
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,890
所以我们现在怎么样了
So where does that leave us?

985
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,940
我希望应该是你想要的那样了
I hope it leaves us where you want us to be.

986
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,350
是的
It does.

987
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,200
完美
It absolutely does.

988
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,410
你是来给我送面包和水的吗
You here to bring me bread and water?

989
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,540
要我说了算  我会让你饿着
If it was up to me, I'd let you starve.

990
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,120
我猜  你是来告诉我他们又要
Let me guess: you're here to tell me how much time

991
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,360
给我加多少刑期的
they're tacking onto my sentence.

992
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,080
但我不在乎
Well, it doesn't matter how much.

993
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,380
因为我还是能报复他
'Cause I'm gonna get to him,

994
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,430
也能报复你
and I'm gonna get to you.

995
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,870
抱歉  弗兰克  但是我们没有要给你
Sorry, Frank, but you're not getting anything

996
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,650
加刑期
tacked onto your sentence.

997
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,130
给你的离别礼物  是让你回你来的地方去
Your parting gift is going back to the maximum security hellhole

998
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,550
最高监管监狱
you came from.

999
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,010
不可能
No way.

1000
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,380
你没权力这么做
You don't have the power to make that happen.

1001
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,260
是的  我没权力
You're right, I don't.

1002
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,930
但是我证监会的朋友可以
But my friend at the SEC sure does.

1003
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,480
你为什么这么不开心呢  弗兰克
Why are you so upset, Frank?

1004
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,760
是不是因为
Does it have anything to do with the fact

1005
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,300
那里的犯人都知道
that every inmate in there

1006
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,030
你做了线人
knows that you're an informant,

1007
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,310
而你能活过第一晚  就算走大运了
and you'll be lucky to make it through your first night?

1008
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,810
你觉得我怕吗
You think I'm afraid?

1009
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,770
我觉得你现在肯定屎都吓出来了
I think you're shitting in your pants right now,

1010
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,300
所以我觉得你应该会对第二个选择
which is why I think you'll be interested

1011
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,230
很有兴趣
in what's behind door number two.

1012
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,150
那就是你安分待在丹伯里监狱
You stay here at Danbury,

1013
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,950
就再蹲个五年
you do five more years,

1014
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,750
哪怕迈克只是过得有一点不舒服
and if Mike so much as gets a pebble in his shoe,

1015
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,680
你就只剩第一种选择了
you go back to door number one.

1016
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,530
我就当你这一脸愤恨是答应了
I'll take that hatred in your face as a yes,

1017
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,450
因为你现在跟我上次把你送进来时候
'cause it's the same look you had

1018
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,320
表情一模一样
the last time I put you away.

1019
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,670
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

1020
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,470
瑞秋呢
Where's Rachel?

1021
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,920
我是来跟你说有人要来看你了
I'm just here to tell you you're about to get a visitor.

1022
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,790
你说服了我阿姨来看我吗
You convinced my aunt to come see me?

1023
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,660
没有  我没能说服她
No, I couldn't convince her.

1024
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,890
但我找到了你的女儿
But I was able to track down your daughter.

1025
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,370
什么
What?

1026
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,100
你没听错
You heard right.

1027
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,730
玛雅就在外面
Maya's right outside.

1028
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,220
我需要静静
I'm gonna need a moment.

1029
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,130
当然
Of course.

1030
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,180
我知道你这么做只是为了让她劝我接受协议
I know you only did this so she'll tell me to take the deal,

1031
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,270
但还是谢谢你
but thank you.

1032
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,170
伦纳德  她根本不知道协议的事
Leonard, she doesn't even know about the deal.

1033
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,000
那你是怎么说服她来的
Then what'd you tell her to get her to come?

1034
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,080
我跟她说我们发现了新的证据
I told her we found new evidence that her father

1035
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,470
可以证明她父亲的清白
is an innocent man.

1036
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,030
而她应该在我们上庭前
And she should hear it from you

1037
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,120
先听你亲口告诉她
before we go to court to prove it.

1038
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,220
所以你真的觉得我做的是对的
So you do think I'm doing the right thing?

但我知道的是  如果真的在乎某个人
But what I do know is, when you care about someone,

1041
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,240
无论如何你都会支持他
you have their back either way.

1042

你准备好了吗
You're ready?
