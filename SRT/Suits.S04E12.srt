吉拉德教授
Professor gerard.

9
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,180
-我来请你帮个忙  -我不会答应的
- I came to ask for a favor. - The answer is no.

10
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,370
所以我带了这个来
Which is why I brought this.

11
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,020
你知道了
You know.

12
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,560
你高谈阔论
And you talk a big game,

13
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,300
但你其实也只是一个普通人
but you're just as human as everyone else,

14
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,960
你这自以为是的混蛋
you smug son of a bitch.

15
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,020
路易
Louis.

16
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,440
-你怎么来了  -我要走了
- What are you doing here? - Leaving.

17
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,930
这样我就不用看着你们两个骗子了
That way I don't have to look at either one of you two liars.

18
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,750
天呐  他知道了
Oh, my God, he knows.

19
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,940
他不仅知道了
He doesn't just know.

20
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,420
还成了冠名合伙人
He's a name partner.

21
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,110
她跑到我面前对我撒谎
She came to me and lied to my face.

22
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,860
她这么做是为了保护我  
She did it to protect me

23
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,920
我打算继续打击她
I'm gonna keep hammering on her

24
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,250
直到你崩溃
until you break.

25
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,390
新的名字带来新的开始
With a new name comes a new beginning.

26
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,330
敬我们最新的冠名合伙人吧  路易·利特
Here's to our newest name partner, Louis Litt.

27
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,040
路易掌握了你的把柄
Louis has something on you.

28
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,580
丹尼尔·哈德曼挪用律所资金
Daniel Hardman embezzled money from the firm,

29
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,570
我为他遮掩了
and I covered it up.

30
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,830
你之前为什么不能信任我  告诉我
Why couldn't you trust me with that before?

31
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,620
因为我不知道你会有什么反应
Because I didn't know how you'd react,

32
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,690
杰西卡
Jessica,

33
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,440
我会帮你保密
your secret is safe with me.

34
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,540
我以为我们现在不搞屋顶谈话了
I thought we were done with rooftop conversations.

35
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,120
有些事得私下说
Some things require privacy.

36
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,430
这话自你半夜策划
I haven't heard you say that

37
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,210
夺下施密特-高登-范·戴克律所就没听你说过了
since the midnight coup of Schmidt, Gordon, and Van Dyke.

38
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,140
闹够了吗
You done?

39
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,850
我不是在开玩笑
It wasn't a joke.

40
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,870
我的事也不是玩笑
Neither is this.

41
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,100
我告诉杰夫·马龙我帮忙
I told Jeff Malone I helped cover up

42
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,610
掩盖了丹尼尔·哈德曼的挪用公款
Daniel Hardman's embezzlement.

43
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,620
你为什么要提那件旧事
Why the hell would you open that time capsule?

44
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,010
因为他知道我们
Because he knew the explanation

45
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,290
给其他合伙人做出的关于路易的解释就是鬼扯
we gave the partners about Louis was bullshit,

46
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,510
我只能告诉他点什么
and I had to tell him something.

47
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,370
你可以告诉他那不关他的事
You could've told him it was none of his business.

48
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,020
哈维  我叫你上来
Harvey, I didn't bring you here

49
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,350
不是为了寻求感情建议
to get relationship advice.

50
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,000
我只是叫你上来告诉你我做了什么
I brought you here to tell you what I did

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,090
以防这事哪天提起
in case it ever came up.

52
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,830
才不是
No, you didn't.

53
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,960
你叫我来是因为这下
You brought me here because now

54
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,270
你得让路易配合你的说辞
you have to get Louis to back you,

55
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,820
你也知道我说了不好听的忠言
and you knew you'd be mad at me

56
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,680
你就会生我气
when I told you what you didn't want to hear.

57
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
没错  我不想听
You're right. I don't want to hear it.

58
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,350
你觉得如果我告诉路易
How do you think it's gonna go

59
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,740
我的感情前途握在他手里
when I tell Louis he holds

60
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,040
会怎么样呢
the fate of my relationship in his hands?

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,980
你觉得等马龙提起路易敲诈的事
How do you think it's gonna go

62
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,320
又会怎么样呢
the first time Malone brings up Louis' blackmail?

63
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,120
我不管
I don't care.

64
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,440
我告诉你吧
Well, I'll tell you how it's gonna go.

65
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,840
路易会回过头来
Louis is gonna look back

66
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,810
贼眉鼠眼地说  "挪用公款
with his beady little eyes and say, "Embezzlement?

67
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,830
我才不是因为那个成了冠名合伙人呢"
That's not how I got my name on the wall."

68
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,010
到时还是要天下大乱
And the shit's gonna hit the fan anyway.

69
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,040
告诉你
You know what?

70
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,540
你有时候真混蛋
You can be a real son of a bitch.

71
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,330
是啊  但你与其生我气
Yeah, but instead of being pissed at me,

72
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,530
还不如对着镜子生自己气
why don't you take a look in the mirror?

73
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,460
因为我们伸出了橄榄枝
Because we held out an olive branch,

74
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,020
但路易一听说这事
and after Louis hears this,

75
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,500
他就会夺下那根橄榄枝
he's gonna take that branch

76
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,380
用它抽死我们
and beat the shit out of us with it.

77
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,730
{\an8}皮尔逊·斯佩克特·利特

78
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,780
路易
Louis.

79
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,560
吉拉德教授  你怎么来了
Professor Gerard? What are you doing here?

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,820
我有件小小的法律事务要处理
I've got a small legal matter to attend to.

81
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,060
我能帮上忙吗
Well, is it anything I can help you with?

82
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,790
其实  我是来找哈维的
Actually, I'm here to speak with Harvey.

83
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,060
我明白
I understand.

84
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,380
你是要找冠名合伙人
You're looking for a name partner.

85
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,790
在这里是看不见
Well, you can't quite see it from here,

86
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,290
但如果你倒退十步
but if you walk back about ten feet,

87
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,270
往左边扫一眼
take a gander to your left,

88
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,960
你就会看到我得到了认可...
you'll see I've gotten a little recognition--

89
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,090
恭喜你  但我说了
I appreciate that, but as I said,

90
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,920
我是来找哈维的
I'm here to speak with Harvey.

91
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,480
我们要谈谈杰西卡给路易的
So are we gonna talk about that little welcome speech

92
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,960
欢迎致辞吗
that Jessica made for Louis?

93
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,060
我们不用谈
We don't have to talk about it

94
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,870
因为路易不会认栽的
because Louis isn't going to accept it.

95
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,900
为什么
Why not?

96
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,650
因为他永远不可能
Because it'll be a cold day in hell

97
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,790
承认我是冰人  他只是小牛
when he can accept being Maverick to my Iceman.

98
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,790
{\an8}冰人  小牛
著名电影《壮志凌云》中主角代号

99
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,140
你是说反了吧
Don't--don't you mean Iceman to your Maverick?

100
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,150
没有
No, I don't.

101
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,250
你比起小牛更想做冰人吗
You actually want to be Iceman over Maverick?

102
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,880
-谁拿到奖杯了  -谁是更好的飞行员
- Who got the trophy? - Who's the better pilot?

103
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,240
-拿奖杯的那个  -错
- The one who got the trophy. - Wrong.

104
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,580
因为最后  小牛救了冰人
Because in the end, Maverick saved Iceman,

105
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,140
否则  奖杯男现在就躺在
and if he hadn't, trophy boy would be sitting

106
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,790
印度洋海底了
on the bottom of the Indian Ocean right now.

107
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,890
那他也还是更厉害
Where he'd still be the man.

108
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,920
那是你的看法
According to you.

109
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,440
我的看法是唯一重要的看法
According to me is the only "according to" that matters.

110
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,250
又来了
Here we go.

111
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,270
或许吧  但我的看法是
Maybe, but according to me,

112
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,340
毒蛇才是电影里的真英雄
Viper was the real hero of that film.

113
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,240
怎么了
What?

114
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,920
你以为我太老没看过《壮志凌云》吗
You think I'm too old to know Top Gun?

115
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,710
我认为
What I think is,

116
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,610
你不该进我办公室
you have no business being in my office.

117
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,700
我们要当着你初级律师的面吵吗
Are we gonna do this in front of your associate?

118
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,680
我们不用当着谁的面做什么
We don't have to do anything in front of anybody.

119
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,860
你出去就好
You just have to go.

120
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,060
哈维
Harvey...

121
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,310
我需要个律师
I need a lawyer.

122
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,990
路易的办公室就在走廊那头
Louis' office is down the hall.

123
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,440
我不要路易
I don't want Louis.

124
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,160
-我要你  -真搞笑
- I want you. - That's funny.

125
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,350
你上次看见我时  你说
The last time you saw me, you told me

126
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,680
我不配在你的象牙塔里做律师
I wasn't fit to practice law in your ivory tower.

127
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,150
我是说
What I told you was,

128
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,490
你会为赢官司而放弃道德
is that you'll sacrifice ethics for wins,

129
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,680
可我现在不在象牙塔里
and right now I'm not in my ivory tower,

130
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,210
我需要赢官司
and I need a win.

131
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,160
我就知道
I knew it.

132
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,150
你跟别人没什么两样
You're just like everybody else.

133
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,560
不择手段是卑劣的
The ends don't justify the means

134
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
除非是你自己有危险
until it's your ass on the line.

135
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,220
你以为我喜欢向你求助吗
Do you think I like asking you for help?

136
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,870
我觉得自由铁路公司的事一定要你命了
I think this Liberty Rail thing must have you by the balls.

137
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,640
你知道了
So you know.

138
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,160
我知道他家火车脱轨后
I know after their train derailed,

139
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,210
你被指派去评估受害者赔付方案
you were appointed to assess the victims' compensation formula,

140
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,480
我知道此事后
and I know after you did,

141
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,100
有部分受害人雇了律师
some of those victims hired a lawyer

142
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,460
展开调查
and opened an investigation.

143
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,100
那你也该知道他们什么都没发现
Then you also know they found nothing.

144
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,890
那问题是  你为什么要来
Then the question is, why are you here?

145
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,100
我宣布改变赔付方案那天
The TSA found $25,000 in my luggage

146
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,920
运输安全管理局在我的行李里找到了两万五千块
the day I announced I was changing the formula.

147
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,550
所以你被指控受贿了
So now you're being accused of accepting a bribe.

148
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,950
但我没受贿
Which I did not do.

149
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,910
祝你能证明这一点  教授
Well, good luck proving that, Professor,

150
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,370
因为我不会帮你的
because it won't be with my help.

151
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,580
我看错你了  斯佩克特先生
I was wrong about you, Mr. Specter.

152
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
我没想到你会因为你不喜欢客户
I never thought that you wouldn't represent somebody

153
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,960
而拒绝代理
just because you didn't like them.

154
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,100
那你又错了
Well, you're wrong again.

155
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,220
我不喜欢你  但我之所以不接你的案子
I don't like you, but I'm not representing you

156
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,730
是因为你做了见不得光的事
because you did something shady,

157
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,630
我不愿为了博你喜欢
and I'm not screwing over crash victims

158
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,610
而去折磨那些受害者
for the likes of you.

159
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,750
你知道我没有做那种事
You know I didn't do this.

160
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,750
我只知道你是自己跑过来的
What I know is you showed yourself in.

161
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,060
现在你也可以自己出去
You can show yourself out.

162
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,620
我不想在吉拉德面前说什么
Hey, I didn't want to say anything in front of Gerard,

163
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,760
但你有没有想过
but has it occurred to you

164
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,940
如果你不接这个案子你就是个傻瓜
that you're an idiot if you don't take this case?

165
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,930
去年  你怕他发现你的事
Last year, you were shitting yourself

166
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,940
怕到都要尿裤子了
he'd find out about you,

167
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,880
现在你却认为我们应该跟他合作
and now you think we should work with him?

168
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,300
不  我当时不是担心他发现
No, I wasn't worried he'd find out.

169
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,660
而是担心路易发现
I was worried about Louis.

170
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,820
吉拉德那时都没有正眼看我一下
Gerard didn't bat an eye at me back then,

171
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,140
刚才也没看
and he didn't just now.

172
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,620
但如果我们帮他拜托了困境
But we get him out of this

173
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,250
如果他以后发现我的事
and he ever does find out about me,

174
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,320
他会欠我们一个人情
he's gonna owe us.

175
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,090
迈克  那个人绝不会因为我们帮他脱困
Mike, that man is never gonna compromise his ethics

176
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,600
就做些道德上的妥协
just because we got him out of a jam.

177
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,620
绝不会做道德上的妥协
Never gonna compromise his ethics?

178
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,880
你刚说他接受了贿赂
You just said he took a bribe.

179
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,740
那又有什么关系
So what does that have to do with anything?

180
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,840
这其中的关系很大
It has everything to do with everything

181
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,840
因为你不觉得他受贿了
because you don't think he did it.

182
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,620
-那又怎样  -又怎样
- So what? - So what?

183
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,990
那说明你拒绝他根本不是因为
That means you're not turning him down

184
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,190
你认为他是个见不得光的小人
because you think he's shady.

185
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,520
你
You're...

186
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,710
你拒绝他是因为
You're turning him down because you have

187
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,050
你对亨利·吉拉德还有怨气
a Henry Gerard-sized chip on your shoulder.

188
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,650
我没有怨气
I do not have a chip on my shoulder.

189
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,950
听起来像有
You sure sound like you do,

190
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,350
这把你变得比傻瓜还糟
which makes you worse than an idiot.

191
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,620
你就是个蠢货
It makes you a jackass.

192
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,880
-你说什么  -你听到了
- Excuse me? - You heard me.

193
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,830
你知道他把赔偿金分配得很公平
You know that he divided that money fairly,

194
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,520
这意味着你只是
which means that you're just--

195
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,890
我不在乎这意味着什么
I don't care what it means,

196
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,450
我也不需要你的说教
and I don't need a lecture from you.

197
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,440
显然你很需要
Apparently you do,

198
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,730
因为你差点就要为了
because you're about to screw over

199
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,810
跟某个伤害过你感情的人较劲
a bunch of innocent people

200
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,350
而危害很多无辜人的生活
just to stick it to some guy who hurt your feelings.

201
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,420
我从来没想过会对你
That's not something I ever thought

202
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,840
说出这种话
I'd be saying to you.

203
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,530
看看这是谁啊
Look who it is,

204
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,250
那个让打压我至此的女人
the woman who put me in my place.

205
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,710
又怎么了
What now?

206
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,950
你想让我再签个什么文件
You want me to sign a piece of paper

207
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,330
承认我就是那个草丘上的守望者吗
admitting that I was the man on the grassy knoll?

208
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,340
庆典上的话我都是发自肺腑的  路易
I meant what I said at the ceremony, Louis.

209
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,070
你是说那个为了引我签字
You mean the ceremony that you only had

210
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,440
才搞的庆典吗
in order to trick me?

211
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,420
我举办庆典是因为你要求了
I had it because you demanded it,

212
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,870
但我来不是谈那事的
but I'm not here to talk about that.

213
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,280
我来是想谈谈杰夫·马龙
I'm here to talk about Jeff Malone.

214
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,070
他怎么了
What about him?

215
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,480
你也许发现了他和我
You may be aware that he and I are--

216
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,850
五十度灰吗  我明白了
Fifty Shades of Grey? I'm aware.

217
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,850
这话我不跟你计较
I'm gonna let that go

218
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,650
因为你也许不知道
because you may also not be aware

219
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,020
我必须要对他撒谎
that I had to lie to him.

220
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,090
他不知道迈克的事  对吧
He doesn't know about Mike, does he?

221
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,260
不知道
No.

222
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,430
但他知道你犯了罪
But he does know you committed a crime

223
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,540
然后辞了职
and that you resigned

224
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,240
但现在你的名字高高的挂在了墙上
and now your name is up on the wall.

225
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,260
你怎么跟他说的
What'd you tell him?

226
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,230
我告诉他你发现了
I told him you found out

227
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,930
我隐瞒了丹尼尔·哈德曼挪用公款的事
that I covered up Daniel Hardman's embezzlement

228
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,870
然后用这件事要挟我
and that you used it to strong-arm me.

229
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,590
然后你现在想让我保守你的另一个秘密
And now you want me to protect another one of your secrets.

230
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,430
是同一个的秘密  路易
It's the same secret, Louis,

231
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,970
而且你在其中牵扯深度跟我一样
and you have just as much invested in it as I do.

232
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,000
不  不一样  因为我不在乎
No, I don't, because I don't care

233
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,240
你和杰夫的关系能不能维持下去
if your relationship with Jeff survives or not.

234
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,170
你想怎么样  路易
What do you want, Louis?

235
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,360
我想要长期帮你保守秘密的好处
I want something for continuing to cover your ass.

236
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,010
你已经得了好处  你的名字挂在墙上了
You got something. You got your name on the wall.

237
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,980
现在我想要与之匹配的尊重
Now I want the respect that comes with it.

238
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,100
意思是
Meaning?

239
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,630
我想要哈维的一个客户
I want one of Harvey's clients.

240
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,040
哪一个
Which one?

241
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,260
那是我和哈维之间的事
That's between me and Harvey.

242
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,700
好吧
Okay.

243
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,820
我同意见面
I agreed to meet.

244
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,310
我希望你不只是要再强调一遍
I hope it's not just so you can tell me

245
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,250
我是一个多糟糕的人
more about what a horrible person I am.

246
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,230
我来是要告诉你我改变了主意
I came here to tell you that I changed my mind.

247
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,350
所以你自己也承认了我没有受贿
So you admitted to yourself that I didn't do this?

248
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,260
我承认了你来找我
I've admitted to myself that you came to me

249
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,510
是因为这个案子不能循规蹈矩
because this case needs rule-bending,

250
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,410
并且你马上就要告诉我这其中的原因
and you're gonna tell me why right now.

251
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,920
那笔钱
The money.

252
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,960
是的  那笔钱
Yes, the money.

253
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,040
如果你没有受贿
If you weren't bribed,

254
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,760
那你是从哪里得来的那两万五千块
where the hell did you get that $25,000 from?

255
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,070
你知道那是从哪里来的
You know where it came from.

256
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,550
和你去年用来勒索我的
It's the same thing you tried to

257
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,230
事情是一样的
use to blackmail me last year.

258
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,460
让我把事情理一理
Let me get this straight.

259
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,940
你这笔钱的来源
You have an explanation for the money

260
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,460
有一个完美的解释
that would get you out of this whole thing.

261
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,020
但我却不能用
But I can't use it.

262
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,660
你要去哪
Where are you going?

263
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,540
去帮你摆脱麻烦
To get you out of this.

264
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,980
欢迎来到现实世界  教授
Welcome to the real world, Professor.

265
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,490
我需要你帮我收集有关加勒特·布雷迪的一切消息
I need you to find out everything you can on Garrett Brady.

266
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,430
没问题  谁是加勒特·布雷迪
Absolutely. Who's Garrett Brady?

267
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,450
吉拉德案子的另一方
The guy on the other side of Gerard's suit.

268
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,980
等等
Wait a second.

269
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,390
这是不是意味着你接了他的案子
Does this mean you took his case?

270
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,940
你知道这意味着我接了他的案子
You know that means I took his case,

271
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,370
我也不想听到任何沾沾自喜的言论了
and I don't want to hear any gloating.

272
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,650
沾沾自喜  没有  没有
Gloating? No, no, no, no, no.

273
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,860
我没有  我没有沾沾自喜
I'm not-- I'm not gloating.

274
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,540
我只是意识到
I'm merely recognizing the fact that

275
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,930
你彻底改变主意
you completely changed your mind

276
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,250
完全是因为我的劝说
based entirely on what I said.

277
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,010
-这就是沾沾自喜  -算一个意思吧
- Which is gloating. - "Po-tay-to," "Po-tah-to."

278
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,670
但鉴于你还是会照自己方式想问题
But as long as you're gonna think of it that way,

279
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,790
所以我还要指出
I might as well point out

280
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,840
因为你听取了我的教诲
that since you listened to my lecture,

281
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,050
所以也许你该称我为  教授
maybe you should start calling me Professor.

282
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,870
如果你想不出吉拉德不在场证明之外的办法
I'm gonna start calling you unemployed

283
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,780
我就要称你为失业者了
if you don't figure out a way around using Gerard's alibi.

284
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,950
等等  我们不能说出钱的来源吗
Wait, we can't say where the money came from?

285
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,720
不能  因为他是玩地下扑克赢来的
No, we can't, because he was playing backroom poker,

286
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,640
如果被发现  哈佛会炒了他
and if that comes out, Harvard fires him.

287
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,310
不是开玩笑吧
Are you kidding me?

288
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,730
他是伦理学教授  却破坏法律
He's an ethics professor, and he's breaking the law?

289
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,900
你以为我威慑么讨厌他
Where the hell do you think my chip comes from?

290
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,440
如果我们不能用本有的辩护
Well, if we can't use his alibi,

291
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,840
又怎么帮他摆脱官司呢
how are we supposed to get him out of this?

292
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,700
我不知道  教授
I don't know, Professor,

293
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,880
但是  是你要我们接手这个案子的
but you're the one who wanted us to take this case,

294
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,490
所以为什么不好好利用你硕大的头脑
so why don't you use that big brain of yours

295
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,570
想出解决办法呢
and find a solution?

296
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,010
把亨利·吉拉德的案子给我
You're giving me Henry Gerard.

297
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,950
什么
What?

298
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,070
我看到他了  我要他
I saw him. I want him.

299
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,520
你接了他的委托  把他给我
You got him. He's mine.

300
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,790
这样做可行不通  路易
That's not the way it works, Louis.

301
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,570
你恐怕得另找一个男朋友
I'm afraid you'll have to find yourself another boyfriend.

302
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,420
这样做必须行得通
Oh, this is exactly how it works.

303
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,610
你去跟杰西卡谈过了  是不是
You talked to Jessica, didn't you?

304
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,440
当然  她利用我给自己擦屁股
Sure did, and she used me to cover her ass,

305
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
所以我要你的一个客户作为回报
so I get one of your clients in return.

306
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,360
你要我的一个客户  这个可以谈
You want one of my clients, we can talk about that,

307
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,830
但是吉拉德不能给你
but Gerard's staying with me.

308
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,240
得了  别装得好像
Please, don't pretend

309
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,710
自己真心在乎他
like you actually care about him.

310
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,860
他甚至都忍不了你
He can't even stand you.

311
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,140
路易  我已经说了要考虑给你
Louis, I just offered to consider giving you

312
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,200
我的一位客户
one of my clients,

313
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,150
你就放过吉拉德吧
so I suggest you let Gerard go.

314
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,440
不  我不放过任何人
No, I'm not letting anything go,

315
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,060
因为没道理那么做
because it doesn't make any sense.

316
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,480
他不但忍不了你
Not only can't he stand you.

317
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,650
还很不尊敬你  因为他...
He doesn't respect you because he's got things...

318
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,040
你刚才说什么
What did you just say to me?

319
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,880
我说他并不尊敬你
I said he doesn't respect you.

320
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,110
你猜怎么的
Well, you know what?

321
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,990
他也绝对不会尊敬你
He definitely doesn't respect you,

322
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,350
因为他跟我说  他需要律师的时候
because when he told me he needed a lawyer,

323
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,500
我试图把他推给你
I tried to send him your way,

324
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,170
而他说
and his exact words were,

325
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,270
"我不要路易  我要你"
"I don't want Louis. I want you."

326
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,570
很好
Fine.

327
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,580
那就给我另一个客户吧
Then I'll just take another one of your clients.

328
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,270
-你什么也得不到  -你刚刚说...
- You're not taking a thing. - You just said that I could...

329
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,400
我不在乎刚才说过什么
Look, I don't give a shit what I just said, okay?

330
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,980
我的客户就是我的客户
My clients are my clients.

331
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,310
如果你不在三秒钟内
And you don't get out of my office

332
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,570
离开我的办公室
in the next three seconds,

333
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,120
你我之间一定有事发生
something's gonna happen between you and me,

334
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,260
而且我保证  此事一旦发生
and I guarantee it won't end with you

335
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,770
你的牙肯定保不全
keeping all of your teeth.

336
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,020
不
No.

337
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,460
回去  别进来
Just turn around and walk right back out that door.

338
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,610
-哈维  -你听到我说的了吗
- Harvey. - Did you hear what I said?

339
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,880
听到了  但显然你没听到
I did, but apparently, you didn't hear

340
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,710
杰西卡所说的息事宁人
what Jessica said about wiping the slate clean.

341
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,520
显然  你也没听到我说了什么
And apparently, you didn't hear what I said,

342
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,720
因为我刚才跟路易说  可以给他一位客户
because I just told Louis he could have one of my clients.

343
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,300
三秒之后你又跟他说不行
And three seconds later, you told him he couldn't.

344
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,540
因为我意识到
because I realized that

345
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,060
我是在为杰西卡的错误买单
I'm paying for Jessica's mistake.

346
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,320
不  哈维  你本愿意为她买单的
No, Harvey, you were willing to pay for her mistake

347
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,330
直到路易说吉拉德不尊敬你
right up until Louis said Gerard doesn't respect you.

348
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,960
跟那个没关系
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.

349
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,270
你可以自欺欺人
You can lie to yourself all you want,

350
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,870
但我才不会让你糊弄我
but I'm not gonna let you bullshit me.

351
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,020
你在说什么鬼话
What the hell are you talking about?

352
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,000
亨利·吉拉德是你尊敬的人之一
Henry Gerard is the one person you respect

353
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,250
而他却不尊敬你  路易碰到了你这根敏感神经
who never respected you, and Louis touched that nerve.

354
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,540
我说了  跟那个没关系
And I told you that has nothing to do with it.

355
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,680
你真心这么想吗
You really think that?

356
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,070
不是这么想  就是这么回事
I don't think it. I know it.

357
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,990
这么说来  哈维
Then you know what, Harvey?

358
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,110
你跟路易没区别
You're no different than Louis,

359
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,340
因为你本来有机会帮我们渡过难关
because you have a chance to help us all move on,

360
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,180
却因为一点小事毁了一切
and you are blowing it off out of pettiness,

361
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,740
路易就是这种人
which is exactly what Louis would do.

362
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,870
你要我怎么做  唐娜
What do you want from me, Donna?

363
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,720
我要你成熟点
I want you to be a grown-up

364
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,530
做你承诺要做的事
and do what you said you'd do in the first place.

365
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:52,960
有进展吗
You got something?

366
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,030
有  我们忽略了最明显的事
Yeah, we've been overlooking the obvious.

367
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,700
别让我一个接一个问问题
Yeah, I'm not in the mood for 20 questions.

368
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,520
赶紧直说
Give it to me.

369
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,030
除非你在不上报的情况下出国
Unless you're traveling internationally and don't report it,

370
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,150
否则带现金上飞机
carrying cash on board a plane

371
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,930
不算犯罪
isn't a crime.

372
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,960
很好  但事实是
Great, except for the fact

373
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,160
吉拉德没有被指控走私
that Gerard's not being charged with smuggling.

374
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,750
而是被起诉了受贿
He's being sued.

375
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,690
没错  但我想说的是
Right, but my point is,

376
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,640
加勒特·布雷迪是怎么发现的呢
how did Garrett Brady even find that out?

377
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,610
他发现了  是因为吉拉德
Well, he found out because Gerard

378
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,900
被运输安全管理局扣住了
was detained by the TSA.

379
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,670
运安局只跟他谈了五分钟
Who talked to him for five minutes

380
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,920
然后就放他走了
and then sent him on his way.

381
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,170
这种调查根本不会被记录在案
Those searches aren't a matter of public record.

382
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,680
-没错  -该死
- Exactly. - Holy shit.

383
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,130
布雷迪贿赂了运安局
Brady bribed the T.S.A..

384
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,230
这不仅违法
Which isn't only illegal.

385
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,200
而且能让那份报告被驳回
It makes that report totally inadmissible.

386
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,600
是你自己想出的这个办法吗
You figured this out on your own?

387
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,510
我本可以更快搞定的
Well, I would've done it faster,

388
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,770
可是我实在想先点份寿司吃
but I had to order some sushi.

389
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,750
"本可以更快搞定"
"Would've done it faster."

390
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,150
你第一周来上班就是这么说的
That's what you said your first week here,

391
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,970
只不过那时吃的是匹萨  不是寿司
except it was pizza instead of sushi.

392
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,950
是的  我成长了
Yeah, I'm growing.

393
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,720
你想说瑞秋教会了你什么叫吃东西吧
You mean Rachel taught you how to eat.

394
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,260
我说了  我成长了
Like I said, I'm growing.

395
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,710
唐娜  我现在很忙
Hey, Donna, I'm a little busy at the moment.

396
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,940
忙得顾不上接这个吗
Too busy to take on this?

397
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,470
那是什么
What's that?

398
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,240
只不过是哈维当上冠名合伙人以后
Just the first client that Jessica gave Harvey

399
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,530
杰西卡给他的第一个委托人
when he made name partner.

400
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,360
哈维说他不会给我任何委托人的
Harvey said he wouldn't let me have any of his clients.

401
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,710
不  他说会给你
No. He said he would.

402
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,200
可随后你不仅不接受
But then instead of taking him up on it,

403
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,810
还伤了他的感情
you went ahead and shit on his feelings.

404
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,180
拜托  哈维根本没有感情
Please. Harvey doesn't have feelings.

405
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,530
这不是真的  你很清楚
That's not true, and you know it.

406
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,800
而且你应该最清楚人在伤心的时候
And you of all people should know that a person

407
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,310
会反应过度
can overreact when they're hurt.

408
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,660
如果你在含沙射影地说我
If you're referring to me,

409
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,980
我可没有反应过度...
I do not overreact when--

410
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,620
{\an8}出自《瘦虎肥龙》

411
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,620
随便你  胖子神探
Okay, whatever you say, Fatty-Baldy.

412
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,630
够了  从我办公室滚出去...
Okay, get the hell out of my office and--

413
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,120
好吧  你说得稍微有那么一点小道理
Fine, you have a small, legitimate point.

414
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,680
我真的伤到他的感情了吗
I really hurt his feelings?

415
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,910
是的  千真万确
Yeah, you really did.

416
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,600
但然后他意识到他反应过度了
But then he realized he was overreacting

417
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,100
他意识到这是一个能让我们大家
and that this was a chance for us all

418
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,560
重归旧好的机会
to get back to where we were.

419
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,510
你能发誓那是他当上冠名合伙人之后
You swear that is the first client

420
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,420
杰西卡给他的第一个委托人吗
that Jessica gave him after me made name partner?

421
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,510
我发誓
I swear.

422
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,410
把档案给我吧
Leave me the file.

423
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,680
你们两个先点吧  我还没想好
You two go ahead. I haven't decided yet.

424
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,420
{\an8}一种用鹰嘴豆泥捏成团炸熟的小吃

425
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,420
实际上我们不是来吃法拉费的
Actually, we're not here for the falafel.

426
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,770
我们来向你自我介绍
We're here to introduce ourselves.

427
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:48,280
{\an8}取餐处

428
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,780
迈克·罗斯
Mike Ross.

429
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,900
哈维·斯佩克特
Harvey Specter.

430
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,270
我们代理了亨利·吉拉德
We represent Henry Gerard.

431
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,530
这样的话那还是让我请你们吃午饭吧
Well, in that case, let me buy you two lunch,

432
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,010
因为我马上要赢一场出乎意料的大官司了
because I'm about to come into an unexpected windfall.

433
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,350
看来你经常这样啊
Well, I guess that's your thing--

434
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,180
付钱让人办事
paying people off.

435
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,060
我希望你贿赂运管局用的不是劣质法拉费
I hope the TSA got more than some shitty falafel.

436
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,390
你们到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

437
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,510
我在说这个
I'm talking about this.

438
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,910
行贿
Bribery?

439
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,080
多讽刺啊  不是吗
Ironic, isn't it?

440
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,740
你因为受贿而起诉吉拉德教授
You suing Professor Gerard for accepting a bribe

441
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,190
结果你才是向联邦雇员行贿的那个人
when you're the one paying off federal employees.

442
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,890
只是被指控行贿  律师
Allegedly paying, Counselor.

443
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,000
小心起诉你们诽谤哦
You don't want to slander me.

444
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,030
-所以你承认了  -我什么都没承认
- So you admit it. - I don't admit a thing.

445
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,010
你们的委托人从火车出轨受害人身上牟利
Your client sold out victims of a train derailment.

446
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,770
他必须付出代价
He's going to pay.

447
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,870
你现在可能不愿意承认任何事
You may not be willing to admit anything here,

448
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,270
但到了法官面前你就得承认了
but you'll have to in front of the judge.

449
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,560
因为我准备申请传唤
Because I've drafted subpoenas

450
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,990
那晚当班的所有运管局雇员
for every TSA employee on duty that night.

451
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,710
撤诉吧  布雷迪先生
Drop the case, Mr. Brady.

452
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,710
你们这是在威胁我吗
Are you threatening me?

453
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,030
不  我们只是告知你
No, we're informing you.

454
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,020
那让我来告知你们
Well, let me inform you.

455
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,600
希望你们没忘记  运管局
In case you forgot, the TSA falls

456
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,340
归属国土安全部管辖
under the Department of Homeland Security,

457
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,030
因此这属于国家安全问题
which makes this a national security issue.

458
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,180
这跟国家安全一毛钱关系都没有
This has nothing to do with national security,

459
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,960
你心知肚明
and you know it.

460
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,850
我只知道政府在一位乘客身上
All I know is the government found

461
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,780
发现了大量现金
a large sum of cash on a passenger.

462
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,850
至于他们是怎么知道的
Now, how they came to know that,

463
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,150
他们接下来怎么调查的
how they proceeded to investigate that,

464
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,340
或者他们拿这一消息怎么办
or what they did with that information

465
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,530
都是政府的事
is the government's business.

466
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,780
你就打算拿这个当挡箭牌吗
And that's what you're going with?

467
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,870
不是我打算拿这个当挡箭牌
That's not what I'm going with.

468
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,450
而是他们会拿这个当挡箭牌
That's what they're going to go with.

469
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,400
所以随便你们传唤多少运管局探员
So you can call up as many TSA agents as you like,

470
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,170
他们一个字都不会说的
but they're not gonna be saying a thing.

471
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,580
你们还是自己买法拉费吧
And you can buy your own damn falafel.

472
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,360
我需要魅力派美妆的资料
I need Cutie Pie Cosmetics.

473
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,850
你又想来找茬吗
You want to try that again?

474
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,960
我今晚要和琼·沃尔什见面
I have a meeting with Joan Walsh tonight,

475
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,830
我需要她的档案
and I need her files.

476
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,230
琼是哈维的委托人
Joan is Harvey's client.

477
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,960
-不再是了  -从什么时候开始
- Not anymore. - Since when?

478
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,320
从什么时候开始不重要
Since it doesn't matter,

479
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,960
我可是冠名合伙人
because I'm name partner,

480
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,150
这意思是我说我需要什么
which means when I say I need something,

481
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,600
你的回答应该是
your response should either be,

482
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,580
"要多少"或者"还需要别的吗"
"How high?" or "Can I have another?"

483
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,150
好吧
Fine.

484
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,650
你需要知道几件事...
There are a few things that you should know--

485
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,110
我需要知道就是
You see, what I know is

486
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,650
你老板以为
your boss seems to think

487
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,530
只要让唐娜安排一顿上等的晚餐
all it takes to impress Joan Walsh

488
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,890
就能打动琼·沃尔什
is getting Donna to make a fancy dinner reservation,

489
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,480
而我却会用我超凡的法律能力打动她
but I'm going to impress her with so much legal domination

490
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,590
今夜过去
that by the end of the night,

491
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,910
她压根不会记得
all she's gonna be able to say is,

492
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,260
哈维·斯佩克特是老几
"Harvey Specter who?"

493
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,970
-好  这就是一个错误...  -错误吗
- Okay, that's a mistake-- - A mistake?

494
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,980
我明白了
Oh, I get it.

495
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,350
你是想用你的法律能力
You're trying to impress me

496
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,900
来打动我
with your legal domination

497
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
证明你不是小小的律师助理
to prove that you're not just a paralegal

498
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,850
而是名合格的律师
but an associate.

499
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,380
不是的  路易  我...
No, Louis. I'm--

500
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,600
听着  我根本不关心你怎么看自己
See, I don't care what you call yourself.

501
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,870
所以除非你糟糕到
So unless you did such a shitty job,

502
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,200
把那份档案写得狗屁不通
the files are unreadable,

503
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,810
否则就赶紧交给我
hand 'em over to me right now.

504
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,390
这样才像话
That's more like it.

505
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,260
这是什么
What's this?

506
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,630
我知道你今晚需要工作
I know you have to work tonight,

507
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,910
但你也需要吃东西
but you also need to eat.

508
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,470
这可不只是吃东西
I wouldn't call this just eating.

509
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,370
一次性盘子可配不上你
Well, you deserve better than paper plates.

510
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,170
我不介意一次性盘子啊
I don't mind paper plates.

511
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,730
我知道你不介意
Oh, I know you don't.

512
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,820
我只是说它配不上你
I just said you deserve better.

513
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,130
这是炖牛肉吗
Is that Ropa Vieja?

514
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,780
我亲手做的
I made it myself.

515
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,530
也就是说你是从四十街和莱克斯街交叉口
Which means you got it at the Cuban place

516
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,050
那家我最喜欢的古巴餐厅买来的
that I love on 40th and Lex.

517
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,100
亲手买来
By myself.

518
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,940
我干了什么获此殊荣
What did I do to deserve this?

519
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,490
我不知道
I don't know.

520
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,050
我只是...
I'm just...

521
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,610
觉得咱俩关系进了一步
feeling closer.

522
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,180
因为我信赖你
Because I confided in you.

523
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,670
因为你的心防正在坍塌
Because the walls are coming down,

524
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,760
我感觉得到
and I can feel it.

525
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,240
我何德何能拥有你
What did I do to deserve you?

526
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,970
我们可以边吃这顿
Well, we can talk about that

527
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,730
全部由我烹制的晚餐  边谈这件事
over this delicious meal that I made all by myself.

528
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,990
敬我们
To us.

529
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,390
然后我说  "海伦
And then I said, "Helen,

530
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,520
那不是纯种博美犬
that's no Pomeranian.

531
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,860
而是混血博美
That's a Pomimo.

532
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,600
你上当啦"
You've been had."

533
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,570
太搞笑了
That is hilarious.

534
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,910
真的  狗狗啊  它们...
Really, dogs, they are--

535
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,440
它们真是太迷人了
they are so fascinating.

536
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,930
你养了很多狗吗  路易
Do you have many dogs, Louis?

537
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,150
才没有
Hell, no.

538
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,470
因为楼规不让养  真是群混...
Building regulations-- it's a cluster of f-f-f...

539
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,660
我和他们斗争好多年了
I've been fighting them for years.

540
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,090
-太可怕了  -是啊
- Oh, that's horrible. - Yes.

541
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,660
你的股权现在也不容乐观啊
As is what's going on with your stock.

542
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,880
路易  我们在吃晚饭呢
Louis, we're having dinner.

543
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,740
-把那玩意拿开  -不不不
- Put that away. - No, no, no.

544
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,980
我只是想着你可能会有兴趣知道
But I just thought you'd be interested to know that

545
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,110
我们可以让股价飙升
we could skyrocket the share price--

546
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,830
现在  我的兴趣只在
Right now what I'm interested in

547
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,240
再点一杯曼哈顿鸡尾酒
is having another Manhattan

548
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,740
以及听听甜品单上有什么
and hearing what's on the dessert list.

549
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,130
你不需要看单子  点法国焦糖蛋奶冻就好
You don't need a list. Get the Crème brulée.

550
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,260
现在  这个股权问题  我有...
Now, this stock issue, I have--

551
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,890
把文件传真到我办公室
Fax the papers to my office,

552
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,330
然后等我回家了再看
and I'll review them when I get home.

553
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,270
等回家再看
When you get home?

554
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
搞什么...
What the f-f...

555
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,130
那我们到底是为什么出来用晚餐
What the hell did we come to dinner for, then?

556
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,130
为了这个啊
For this.

557
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,620
"这个"指什么
What this?

558
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,610
这个
This.

559
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,740
好吧
Okay.

560
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,570
我不知道哈维是如何处理这些季度报告的
I don't know how Harvey handled these quarterly reviews,

561
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,740
-但是我...  -哈维...
- but I-- - Oh, Harvey...

562
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,070
他真是太棒了
was magnificent.

563
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,820
老实说  当我听说将由你来代替他
Truth be told, I was a little disappointed

564
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,320
处理这件事时
when I heard that you'd be handling this

565
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,960
我有点失望
instead of him,

566
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,000
但我还没看过你跳恰恰舞呢
but I haven't seen your cha-cha yet,

567
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,490
所以尚未有定论
so the jury's still out.

568
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,490
{\an8}Jury有陪审团之意
此句直译为"陪审团还没回来"

569
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,800
这是个律师笑话
That was a lawyer joke.

570
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,920
是的  我听明白了
Yep. Got it.

571
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,860
没错
Yep.

572
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,320
听着  琼
Listen, Joan,

573
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,730
我觉得你真的会很高兴
I think you're gonna be really glad

574
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,400
今晚在这里的是我
that it was me here tonight,

575
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,460
因为我已经送了封信给你的董事会了
because I already sent a letter to your board.

576
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,600
-然后我...  -你干了什么
- And I--  - You did what?

577
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,160
我通知了他们这件事
I notified them of this.

578
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,620
那就是...
That's --

579
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,010
我一直试图告诉你的事
what I'm trying to tell you.

580
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,340
你为什么要做这种显而易见的蠢事
Why the hell would you do something so patently stupid?

581
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,300
蠢
Stupid?

582
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,410
我可不是靠卖蠢当上冠名合伙人的
Hey, I didn't become name partner being stupid.

583
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:23,910
不是吗
Didn't you?

584
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,050
董事会中的两名成员
Two members of my board

585
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,920
马上就要到任期年限了
are about to reach their term limits.

586
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,110
其中至少有一人已被魅力美妆公司选定了
At least one is being circled by Glamour Cosmetics.

587
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,750
你刚刚把一个我研发了数年的产品
You have just notified that person of a product

588
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,890
告诉了那个人
that I've had in R & D for years,

589
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,990
如今他们能拿这个到我最大的竞争对手那
and now they can trade information for a seat

590
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,800
里去换取董事会席位了
on the board of my biggest competitor.

591
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,810
琼  我不知道...
Joan, I didn't know--

592
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,710
告诉我  利特先生
Tell me, Mr. Litt,

593
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,480
你真的是从法学院毕业的吗
did you actually graduate from law school,

594
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,050
还是花钱买的文凭
or did you just buy your way onto the letterhead?

595
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,780
你最好把包放下
Yeah, you better put that bag down,

596
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,080
因为我们整晚都要待在这里了
because we're staying all night.

597
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,700
琼的事情进行的不顺利  是吧
Didn't go well with Joan, did it?

598
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,410
是不顺利  因为你拖了我后腿
No, it didn't, because you sandbagged me.

599
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,680
我没有拖你后腿
I didn't sandbag you.

600
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,980
那你怎么称呼"没告诉我
Well, then what do you call not telling me

601
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,820
魅力美妆在挖她董事会成员"这件事
that Glamour was circling her board members?

602
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,760
我试着告诉你来着
I tried to tell you,

603
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,300
但是你在狂怒之下什么也听不进去
but you couldn't hear me through all of your rage.

604
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,450
我现在没听见的
What I'm not hearing

605
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,370
是你把包包放下的声音
is the sound of you putting your bag down,

606
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,400
因为明天下午董事会成员就要开会了
because the board members are meeting tomorrow afternoon,

607
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,520
而我必须在那之前补救这件事
and I only have until then to fix this.

608
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,710
你是想要我帮你吗
And you want me to help you?

609
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,250
你是这个案子的律师  不是吗
You're the associate on this case, aren't you?

610
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,110
-现在我又成律师了  -你猜怎么着
- So now I'm an associate? - Hey, you know what?

611
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,120
现在不是讨论这个的好时候
Now is not the time to get into it.

612
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,880
不  现在恰恰是讨论这个的好时候
No, now is exactly the time to get into it,

613
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,180
因为你抓住每一个机会
because you have taken every opportunity possible

614
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,950
让我觉得自己一无是处
to make me feel like I am nothing,

615
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,830
而如今  就算你有求于我
and now, even though you want something,

616
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,540
你还是不把我当回事
you're still treating me like I'm nothing.

617
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,300
我对你和对其他每一个律师没什么不同
I'm treating you like every other associate.

618
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,410
那是胡话  你猜怎么着
That is bullshit, and you know what?

619
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,410
就算真是这样
Even if it were true,

620
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,170
你以前不是这样对我的
you didn't used to treat me that way.

621
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,390
那是因为我以前不知道你每天都在欺骗我
I didn't used to know you lied to me on a daily basis.

622
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,070
路易  假如我拿上包走人
Louis, it would serve you right

623
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,630
回家到我爱的人身边  留你一人在这里
if I take my bag and leave you here

624
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,720
也是你活该
and go home to the man that I love.

625
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,830
所以你是不打算帮忙了
So you're not gonna help.

626
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,210
不  我会帮你的
No, I'm gonna help you,

627
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,270
但不是因为你理应得到我的帮助
but not because you deserve it.

628
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,750
我会帮你  是因为我是一名律师
I'll do it because I am an associate,

629
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,830
而且我是专业的
and I am a professional,

630
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,980
这意味着为了做好我的工作
which means I am capable

631
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,240
我能够将私人情感放在一边
of putting the personal aside in order to do my job.

632
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,300
麻烦再要一个那个
And one of those, please.

633
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,120
我正好想要来一个
Just what I was in the mood for.

634
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,270
你要买百吉饼
Ah, you're getting a bagel.

635
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,620
那就是说你成功了
That means you kicked ass.

636
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,900
的确如此
Which I did.

637
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,810
你是打了电话给运管局
You called up the TSA,

638
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,600
攻破了他们国家安全级别的防线吗
busted up their national security defense?

639
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,230
不  我利用了他们的防线
No, I used their defense.

640
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,840
吉拉德会在保密的情况下作证
Gerard's gonna testify under seal

641
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,790
因为这事关国家安全
because it's a matter of national security.

642
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,050
法官会信吗
And the Judge bought that?

643
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:42,980
当然会信了
What's not to buy?

644
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,580
运管局为我们铺好了路
The TSA made the argument for us.

645
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,720
布雷迪怎么说
And what did Brady say?

646
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,420
这是最精彩的部分
That's the best part about it.

647
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,280
他完全不知情
He doesn't even know it.

648
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
因为事关国家安全
It's a matter of national security.

649
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,040
我们在保密情况下作证
We testify under seal,

650
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,980
法官意识到吉拉德是个堕落的赌徒
the Judge realizes that Gerard is a degenerate gambler...

651
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,000
但也是个公正的调解员
But a fair mediator.

652
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,900
这个案子被驳回  加勒特·布雷迪
The case gets dismissed, and Garrett Brady

653
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,890
和哈佛法学院根本不会知道这件事
and Harvard Law never know it happened.

654
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,500
这都是你想出来的
You thought of all of that on your own?

655
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,050
你以为只有你能想出一个
You think you're the only one who can come up

656
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,720
聪明的解决办法吗
with an intelligent solution?

657
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,100
我们共事这么久
You are 1 for 400

658
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,520
四百个案子里你也就能想出一个
in the time we've worked together.

659
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,030
好了  聪明人  既然我替你干了你的活
Okay, smart guy, since I did your job for you,

660
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,730
你就得帮我做我的
you're gonna do my job for me.

661
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,790
你想让我帮吉拉德做取证预演
You want me to prep Gerard

662
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,850
因为你不想跟他共处一室
because you don't want to sit in a room

663
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,590
听他唠叨两个小时
and listen to him talk for two hours.

664
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,220
十五年前我就我不想
I didn't want to 15 years ago,

665
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,560
现在更不想
and I don't want to now.

666
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,510
我们只有一次机会
We only get one shot at this,

667
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,680
他的证词一定要无懈可击
and his testimony better be rock solid.

668
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,590
谢了
Thanks.

669
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,830
拿走吧  别客气
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself!

670
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,140
混蛋
Dick.

671
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,730
你一宿没睡啊
I see you haven't slept.

672
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,550
我要处理的事太多了
I have a lot of work that needs attending to.

673
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,660
我猜也是  鉴于今天早上
I bet you do, considering the phone call

674
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,470
我接到了琼·沃尔什的电话
I got from Joan Walsh this morning.

675
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,600
她给你打电话了
She called you?

676
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,800
她想知道某位冠名合伙人浑水摸鱼的事
She wanted to know what the other name partners

677
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,230
另一位冠名合伙人要怎么处理
were going to do about the one that screwed the pooch.

678
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,510
得了吧  这不公平
Oh, come on, that is not fair.

679
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,590
我没拿到所有的信息...
I didn't have all the information--

680
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,060
你倒是有足够的信息
You had enough information

681
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,700
跟她谈条件  把她从哈维手里抢过来
to make a deal to get her from Harvey,

682
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,790
条件当中还包括瞒着我和杰夫
and part of that deal was you backing me with Jeff.

683
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,800
你是因为这个才来的
Oh, so that's why you're here.

684
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,010
你不相信我能搞定
You don't trust I'm still gonna do it?

685
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,480
因为你到现在都没搞定
Because you haven't done it yet,

686
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,670
而且你不止一次在事情不按设想发展时
and you have a history of making poor decisions

687
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,030
做出错误决定了
when things aren't going your way.

688
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,570
我唯一的错误决定
The only poor decision I've made

689
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,520
就是同意帮你隐瞒真相
is agreeing to cover for you in the first place.

690
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,930
你用这件事当把柄为自己谋利的时候
You didn't think that was such a bad idea

691
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,780
也没觉得有什么不好啊
when you were using it to get what you wanted.

692
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,460
现在你在威胁要夺走我的成果吗
And now you're threatening to take that thing away.

693
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,330
路易  你想留住琼
Louis, you want to keep Joan,

694
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,260
那是你的事
that's on you,

695
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,080
但我好好履行了我们的交易
but I held up my end of the bargain.

696
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,250
你最好别玩砸了
You better hold up yours.

697
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,330
我只是想在回顾一遍  教授
I just want to go over it one more time, Professor.

698
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,950
赌注有多少钱
How much money was in that pot?

699
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,160
我已经回顾烦了
I'm tried of going over it.

700
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,300
为什么我们非得一遍又一遍地
Why do we have to keep replaying

701
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,800
从头回想呢
every moment of this game?

702
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,680
因为它是整个案子的关键
Because your entire case depends on it.

703
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,820
我的案子取决于那些钱是我赌博赢的
My case depends on the fact that I won that money gambling,

704
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,970
我是不是用同花赢得很重要吗
not whether I won it with a flush.

705
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,890
案子想获胜的关键是法官相信你的话
Your case depends on the judge believing you,

706
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,930
如果他在你的证词里找出任何漏洞  那我们
and if he finds any holes in your testimony, then we--

707
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,420
我把赌桌上所有人的名字告诉你
I gave you the names of everyone I knew at that game.

708
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,740
但你赢得那些钱的时候他们都不在
But none of those men were there when you won that money.

709
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,230
我不知道手下败将的名字  我也没办法
I can't help it if I didn't get the name of the guy I beat.

710
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,320
所以你的故事必须无懈可击
Which is why your story needs to be rock solid.

711
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,900
好吧
Okay.

712
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,710
继续吧
Go ahead.

713
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,240
所以我再问你一遍  教授
So I ask you again, Professor,

714
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,910
最终局的赌注有多少钱
how much money was in the final pot?

715
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,820
大约一万二
Roughly $12,000.

716
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,070
然后你赢了
And you won that hand.

717
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,750
就像我说过的  我赢了
As I said before, I won,

718
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,920
然后我将筹码兑现
and then I cashed out.

719
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,730
你的牌是什么来着
And what did you have again?

720
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,930
Q同花
A queen-high flush.

721
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,030
输家是谁
And who did you beat?

722
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,870
我说过了  我不知道他的名字
I told you, I didn't get his name.

723
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,190
那他的牌是什么
Okay, so what did he have?

724
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,580
Q和6的双对
Two pair, queens over sixes.

725
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,370
等一下
Wait a second.

726
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,980
你之前说你旁边的人
You said before that the man next to you

727
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,330
手里有两个Q
folded with two queens up,

728
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,600
现在这人手里又有两个Q
and now this guy has two queens,

729
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,680
你还是个Q同花
and you had a queen-high flush?

730
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,890
我之前说我旁边的人
I said that the man next to me

731
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,440
手里是两张K
folded with two kings.

732
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,380
不  你不是这么说的
No, you didn't.

733
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,340
你听错了
You heard me wrong.

734
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,640
我没听错
No, I didn't.

735
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,500
这到底是在取证预演
Is this part of prepping me,

736
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,230
还是你在指控我
or are you accusing me of something?

737
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,450
我在帮你把故事捋顺
I'm trying to get your story to line up.

738
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,950
-我的故事没问题  -我觉得有问题
- My story does line up. - Not to me, it doesn't.

739
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,750
年轻人  如果你坐在这
Look, young man, if you're gonna sit over there

740
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,700
说我是骗子
and call me a liar--

741
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,810
我没说你是骗子
I'm not calling you a liar,

742
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,820
但如果你明天照今天这么说
but if you say tomorrow what you said today,

743
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,920
我们的麻烦就大了
we're gonna be in a lot of trouble,

744
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,970
因为据我所知
because where I come from,

745
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,570
一副扑克只有四张Q
there are only four queens in a deck.

746
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,390
我说的是两张K
I said two kings,

747
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,040
我明天也会这么说
and I'm gonna say that again tomorrow.

748
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,860
做好你的工作
So you do your job,

749
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,370
我也会做好我的
and I'm gonna do mine.

750
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,450
他在撒谎
He's lying.

751
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,640
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

752
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,110
吉拉德那个打扑克赢钱的故事
Gerard's story about winning all that money

753
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,560
纯属一派胡言
playing poker is bullshit.

754
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,010
好吧  慢点说  到底发生了什么
All right, slow down. What the hell happened?

755
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,910
我算过了  玩家手里的牌对不上
I did the math, and the hands don't add up.

756
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,880
什么叫你算过了
What do you mean you did the math?

757
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,320
他先是说第四张牌抓到的是Q
I mean first he said that he drew a queen on fourth street,

758
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,770
之后我跟他确认的时候...
and then when I pressed him about it, he--

759
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,450
等一下
Wait a second.

760
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,670
你这结论是根据他在盘问时
This conclusion is based on him recalling hands

761
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,170
他回忆的牌得出的
under cross-examination?

762
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,110
哈维  我在大西洋城
Harvey, I got kicked out

763
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,530
因为算牌被赶出去过
of Atlantic City for counting cards.

764
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,350
我了解这种把戏  
I know this shit.

765
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,260
那也不能说明他撒谎了
It doesn't mean he's lying.

766
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,960
我对这种情况也有点经验
I got a little experience with that too,

767
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,140
我告诉你  他撒谎了
and I'm telling you, he was.

768
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,180
-或许他只是累了  -或者我猜对了
- Or maybe he's tired. - Or maybe I'm right.

769
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,930
或者你根本不知道你在说什么
Or maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.

770
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,220
为什么你总是为他辩护
Why are you defending him?

771
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,720
是你叫我辩护的
Because you asked me to.

772
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,200
哈维
Look, Harvey,

773
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,820
我没说他受贿了
I'm not saying that he took a bribe.

774
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,280
我只想说他那笔钱不是玩牌得来的
I'm just saying that he didn't get that money playing poker.

775
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,160
除非他承认了  否则明天还得出庭作证
Well, unless he admitted that, he's testifying tomorrow.

776
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,550
你从什么时候开始成了鸵鸟
Since when do you stick your head in the sand?

777
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,180
-他承认了吗  -没有
- Did he admit it? - No, he didn't.

778
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,310
但他什么细节都对不上  这不应该
But he screwed up the details, and he shouldn't have,

779
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:11,290
如果说的是真话  可不会这样
because people who are telling the truth get it right.

780
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,650
你心里也清楚
And you know it.

781
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,530
那是什么
What's that?

782
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,070
对J三张四  满堂彩
Jacks full of fours.

783
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,970
我知道  但为什么...
I can see that, but why--

784
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,650
为什么把它们摆在你面前吗
Why is it staring you in the face?

785
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,280
我上回就靠这一手赚了一大笔
It's what I threw down the last time I won a huge hand.

786
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,690
那是六个礼拜前  我还能记得
It was six weeks ago, and I can remember every hand

787
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,600
那张桌上每一个玩家的每一手牌
that every player at that table had.

788
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,140
如果你那天晚上赢钱了
Now, if you won money the other night,

789
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,220
你也会记得的
you'd remember it too.

790
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,370
我记得啊
I do remember,

791
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,040
就像我跟你的律师说的...
and as I explained to your associate--

792
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,620
够了  别糊弄我了
Yeah, stop bullshitting me.

793
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,770
那笔钱究竟是从哪里来的
Where the hell did that money really come from?

794
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,910
如果你不说真话
'Cause if you don't tell me the truth,

795
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,670
我就取消明天的听证会
I'm canceling that hearing right now.

796
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,660
钱是从...
It came...

797
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,260
我一个学生那儿来的
from a student of mine.

798
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,750
做什么用
For what?

799
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,450
让我帮他改成绩
In exchange for changing his grade.

800
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,010
我的天  要两万五
Jesus Christ. For $25,000?

801
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,690
他本会挂了我这门课
He was going to fail my class,

802
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,650
这会影响一些公司录取他...
and that would've stopped him from getting an offer from--

803
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,150
你这个伪君子
You goddamn hypocrite.

804
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,090
你满嘴道德伦理却做出这种事
You preach about ethics, and you do this?

805
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,010
这是道德伦理的事
This is about ethics.

806
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,810
你根本不知道我为何如此
And you don't have any idea why I did it.

807
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,750
我才不在意你的动机
I don't care why you did it.

808
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,430
我只关心你让我做了什么
I care about what you're making me do,

809
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,330
我是不会去做伪证的
because I am not suborning perjury.

810
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,920
你敢说没做过比这更过分的事吗
Well, you tell me that you've never done anything worse.

811
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,110
我就知道
I knew it.

812
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,720
如果是其他人你就帮了这个忙
You would do it for someone else...

813
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,020
但就是不会帮我
but not for me.

814
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,480
你知道吗  教授
You know what, Professor?

815
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,580
其实我内心还是有一点点指望
There's a small part of me that actually thought

816
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,810
你觉得我是最好的律师才来找我
that you came to me because you thought I'm the best,

817
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,120
但你竟然以为我会为了赢不择手段
but you just think I'll do whatever it takes to win.

818
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,520
不就是这样你才是最厉害的律师吗
Isn't that what makes you the best?

819
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,460
找其他人替你做这些卑鄙勾当
Get someone else to do your dirty work,

820
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,300
我是不会替你做伪证的
because I'm not suborning perjury.

821
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,510
你在做什么
What are you doing?

822
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,570
促进我的血液流通
Getting my blood flowing.

823
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,080
我在这里坐了一晚
I've been sitting here all night,

824
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,200
每小时有14个人死于下肢不宁综合症
and restless leg syndrome kills 14 people every hour.

825
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,200
我觉得这数字不太准确
I don't think that's accurate.

826
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,790
我不管你怎么觉得  有进展吗
I don't care what you think. What do you have?

827
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,400
我找到能够挽回琼的方法了
I found a way to fix things with Joan.

828
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,220
好吧  你想说研发部门的东西
Okay, you're arguing anything in R & D

829
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,130
是自主知识产权
is the intellectual property

830
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,580
产权属于产品的提出者
of the person who suggested the product?

831
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,630
直到研发结果公布于众
Until such time that the results become public.

832
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,490
我向董事会递信那一刻就公开了
Which they did the second I sent the board that letter.

833
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,780
但董事会成员受
Except board members are subject

834
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,860
保密协定约束
to the nondisclosure agreement.

835
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,910
他们并没有签署
Well, the board members haven't signed

836
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,920
保密协定啊
a nondisclosure agreement.

837
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,970
是还没
Yet.

838
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,440
万一他们不愿意签怎么办
What's to stop them from refusing?

839
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,390
不怎么办  如果他们不签字
Nothing, but if they do,

840
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,710
非竞争条款就派上用场了
then the noncompete kicks in.

841
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,860
以诉讼为威胁
Preventing them from revealing the contents of my letter

842
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,150
防止公布那封信的内容
under threat of prosecution.

843
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,010
特别是针对商业间谍诉讼
Specifically corporate espionage.

844
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,130
我的天  你这个点子是从...
Oh, my God. You got this idea from--

845
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,660
-我们的章程里来的  -我写的章程
- Our bylaws. - My bylaws.

846
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,540
瑞秋  我的天  这真是...
Rachel, holy shit, this is...

847
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,860
可以接受的方法
acceptable.

848
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,930
我觉得你想说的那个词是"了不起"
I think the word you're looking for is "Awesome."

849
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,520
我想说的是"出去
Well, the word I'm saying is, "Get out,

850
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,720
因为我有个会要准备"
because I have a meeting to prepare for."

851
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,070
你知道吗  路易  我为此工作了整晚
You know what, Louis? I have been working all night.

852
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,090
这解救你于水火
And this gets your ass out of a major sling,

853
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,940
所以与其赶我走
so instead of dismissing me,

854
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,540
你该让我跟你一起去
you should be asking me to come with you.

855
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,860
抱歉  专业小姐
Excuse me, Miss Professional.

856
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,580
你不是希望我对律师一视同仁吗
You wanted me to treat you like every other associate.

857
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,490
-现在就是  -像我什么都没做一样对我
- Now I am. - By acting as if I did nothing?

858
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,500
不  认可你做的工作就是一视同仁
No, by acknowledging you did acceptable work.

859
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,900
让你和我一起去这种事
Letting you come with me is something

860
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,820
是我把你当朋友才可能发生的
that I would only do for you if we were friends,

861
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,950
但我们不是朋友
which we are not.

862
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,910
你取消了听证会
You canceled the hearing.

863
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,460
你说得对
You were right.

864
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,010
他撒谎了
He was lying.

865
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,970
真遗憾
I'm sorry.

866
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,820
在我发现赌博的真相后
You know, I knew he was a hypocrite

867
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,370
已经知道他是个伪君子
after I found out about the gambling.

868
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,380
可我从来没想过他会出卖哈佛
I never thought he'd sell out Harvard.

869
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,710
你说什么
What are you talking about?

870
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,990
他确实受了贿
He did take the bribe,

871
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,190
但与意外的受害者无关
but it had nothing to do with the accident victims.

872
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,270
他受贿帮一个学生改成绩
He did it to change someone's grade.

873
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,910
他为什么要这么做
Why would he do that?

874
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,750
这动机还重要吗
What difference does it make?

875
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,920
无论如何  他都曾要我替他做伪证
Either way, he was gonna let me suborn perjury.

876
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,250
如果我们要赢这案子  动机当然重要
It makes a difference because we still have to win this case.

877
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,360
我才不在乎这个案子能不能赢
Oh, I don't give a shit about winning this case.

878
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,010
我从来没听你这么说过
I've never heard you say anything like that before.

879
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,000
每一个案子  每一场比赛
You--you care about winning every case,

880
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,430
每一次辩论你都想赢
every game, every argument.

881
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,320
你听见我说的了吗
Did you hear me?

882
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,910
他要让我去做伪证
He was gonna let me suborn perjury.

883
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,740
如果能就此逃过一劫
And so would every client you have

884
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,270
你所有客户都会要求你这么做啊
if they thought they'd get away with it.

885
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,240
他不是其他的客户
He's not every client.

886
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,560
他是你之前就很讨厌的人
No, he's the one you hated in the first place.

887
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,780
-我没有讨厌他  -哈维  到底怎么了
- I didn't hate him. - Harvey, what is going on here?

888
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,630
我以为和我们比  他是个好人
I thought he was better than us.

889
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,820
我坐在教室里听他讲课
I sat in that class and listened to him talk

890
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,700
讲我们以后应该成为什么样的律师
about what kind of lawyers we should be,

891
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,500
而我总是让他失望  因为我知道
and I always let him down because I knew

892
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,620
他说的那种律师赢不了官司
that wasn't the kind of lawyer that wins.

893
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,620
但是我想要胜利
And I wanted to win.

894
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,410
所以我跟他争论
So I'd argue with him,

895
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,400
所以他鄙视我
and he'd look down on me.

896
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,490
但现在不是你让他失望
And now instead of you letting him down,

897
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,200
是他让你失望了
he let you down.

898
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,690
最后证明他并没有比我们好到哪里去
He turned out to be no better than any of us.

899
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,420
那我们就把他变得比我们好
So then let's make him better than us.

900
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,670
{\an8}魅力派

901
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,570
沃尔什小姐
Miss Walsh.

902
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,590
我今天没预约见你
You are not on my schedule today.

903
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,200
沃尔什小姐  请看下这个
Ah, ah, Miss Walsh, please take a look at this.

904
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,890
这是什么
What is it?

905
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,430
弥补错误的机会
It's a chance to make things right.

906
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,970
你不能因为董事会成员可以开报销单
You cannot call board members employees

907
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,400
就把他们当普通雇员
based on them having access to an expense account.

908
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,940
不只是报销单
Not just an expense account.

909
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,390
他们还有公司信用卡和常设办公室
They have corporate cards and standing offices,

910
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,650
这些都在国内税收法规的
which, as defined by section 14.2

911
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,300
第14.2栏里注明了的
of the Internal Revenue Code,

912
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,880
他们就是一般雇员
makes them employees.

913
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,350
利特先生
Well, Mr. Litt,

914
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,620
看来我不需要再指定其他律师了
seems I won't be demanding a new point person after all.

915
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,950
很高兴听您这么说
I'm glad to hear that.

916
00:32:59,320 --> 00:32:59,870
真的吗
Are you?

917
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,980
当然
Of course I am.

918
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,810
你是我成为冠名合伙人后的第一位委托人
You're my first client as name partner.

919
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,080
您对我来说非常重要
You're very important to me.

920
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,380
再有人成为新冠名合伙人的时候
Well, I suppose we'll find out the truth

921
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,250
我再看你是不是真的这么想了
when someone else makes name partner.

922
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,450
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

923
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,900
我不傻
I'm not an idiot.

924
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,150
我知道我在你们律所是个烫手山芋
I know that no one in your firm wants to deal with me.

925
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,030
不是这样
That's not true.

926
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,310
事实上  你是我争取来的
In fact, I fought for you.

927
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,690
你可能以为你是费力争取的
You may have thought you were fighting for me,

928
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,830
但我知道我是杰西卡扔给哈维的
but I know that Jessica dumped me on Harvey,

929
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,880
看起来你一成为冠名合伙人
and it seems that the second you made name partner,

930
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,410
哈维就把我扔给了你
Harvey did the same thing to you.

931
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,530
哦  你不知道啊
Oh, you didn't know that, did you?

932
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,950
那看来我们是挺有缘的
Then maybe we were meant for each other,

933
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,770
因为我们都是被抛弃的那个
since we're both left out of the club.

934
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,190
你背叛了我
You betrayed me.

935
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,150
你高谈阔论地说要修复友谊
You make this big speech about repairing our friendship,

936
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,310
结果只是说说而已
and all it was  more words.

937
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,270
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

938
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,070
你说服了我去接下琼的单子
You convinced me to take Joan,

939
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,000
然后顺便隐瞒了你其实
while conveniently leaving out the fact

940
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,550
是在帮哈维的事实
you're doing Harvey a favor.

941
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,020
路易  那不是我劝你原因
That's not why I did it, Louis.

942
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,300
好  那你现在告诉我  哈维受得了琼吗
Well, just tell me right now, can he stand her?

943
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,180
受不了  但他是打算留着这个单子的
No, but he was gonna keep her

944
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,910
因为你...
because you--

945
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,370
伤害了他宝贵的感情  我知道
Hurt his precious feelings. I know.

946
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,510
我觉得很抱歉
I felt so awful about that.

947
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,420
知道吗  路易  你是该抱歉的
You know what, Louis? You should.

948
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,090
并且  你也该为你现在对我犯浑
And while you're at it, you should feel pretty awful

949
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,370
感到抱歉
about being a dick to me right now.

950
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,570
可是你又骗了我
You lied to me again.

951
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,540
我没有  路易  我是又为你争取了一次
No, Louis. I fought for you...again.

952
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,130
你没有
No.

953
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,690
你把琼说得很重要
You made Joan sound important.

954
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,460
"哈维成为冠名合伙人的时候
"The first client that Jessica gave Harvey

955
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,340
"杰西卡给他的第一位客户"
when he made name partner."

956
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,180
她的确很重要  路易  但是你看不到
She is important, Louis, but you can't see that

957
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,210
因为你想要的不是客户
because you didn't want a client.

958
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,000
而是从哈维那里夺走些什么
You just wanted to take something away from Harvey.

959
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,130
我要的是尊重
What I want is respect.

960
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,300
那就别再一意孤行了
Then get out of your own way

961
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,460
加入我们  跟我们合作
and get on the goddamn team.

962
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,500
你是说那个瞒着我迈克秘密的小团体吗
You mean the team that kept Mike's secret from me?

963
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,580
不  路易
No, Louis!

964
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,360
我是指那个会保护成员的团队
I mean the team that protected its own,

965
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,230
因为团队就应该这样
because that's what teams do.

966
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,950
而且  我本不应该告诉你
And, you know, I shouldn't even be telling you this

967
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,110
因为她没打算告诉你
because she wasn't going to,

968
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,630
但是如果你需要更多的证据
but if you need a little bit more evidence

969
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,990
来看我们会为队友做什么
of what we do for each other,

970
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,850
那就看看瑞秋
then take a look at Rachel,

971
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,630
因为她给卡特里娜找了份工作
because she got Katrina a job.

972
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,760
-什么  -正是
- What? - That's right.

973
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,310
你之前的律师
Your former associate,

974
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,770
但是你却对瑞秋肆意践踏
and you've been treating Rachel like shit.

975
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,090
所以  如果你吼够我了
So, if you're done yelling at me,

976
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,450
我建议你在最近搞砸的那么多事里挑一个
then I suggest you go fix one of the thousand things

977
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,670
好好弥补一下
that you have screwed up lately,

978
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,850
因为我们已经不想再为你争取什么了
because the rest of us, we are done fighting for you.

979
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,010
罗斯先生
Mr. Ross.

980
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,570
你肯定是伊安了
Ah, you must be Ian.

981
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,030
千万别叫我罗斯先生
And, please, don't call me Mr. Ross.

982
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,380
-叫迈克就好  -没问题
- Mike is fine. - Ah, sure.

983
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,060
多谢来电  迈克
Hey, thanks for your call, Mike.

984
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,860
皮尔逊-斯佩克特是家很棒的律所
Pearson Specter is a great firm.

985
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,330
你也是个很棒的候选者
Ah, well, you're a great candidate.

986
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,970
我很好奇为什么你还在面试
I'm a little curious why you're still interviewing.

987
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,080
我听说斯卡登确定要雇你了
I heard you had a solid offer at Skadden.

988
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,750
对  但斯卡登-阿布斯不是皮尔逊-斯佩克特
I do, but Skadden Arps is no Pearson Specter.

989
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,590
你确定不是因为
Are you sure it's not because

990
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,220
你担心他们会发现你挂了
you're worried they'll find out that you failed

991
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,030
吉拉德教授的法律职业道德课
Professor Gerard's legal ethics class?

992
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,400
-什么  -我去
- What? - Oh, shit.

993
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,390
你不知道啊
You don't know.

994
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,840
他收了你的两万五千块
He hasn't changed your grade,

995
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,660
但没有给你改成绩
but he still has your $25,000.

996
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,010
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

997
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,560
我的确有跟你说的那个身份
I'm exactly who I said I was.

998
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,910
没有跟你说的身份是
The only thing I left out is that

999
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,460
吉拉德教授是我的客户
Professor Gerard is my client.

1000
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,430
他不可能因为这事惹祸上身
Well, he can't be in trouble for this.

1001
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,410
我很清楚
I'd know.

1002
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,230
不是这个
He's not.

1003
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,810
他被指控在执行联邦仲裁期间
He's being accused of accepting a bribe

1004
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,600
收受贿赂
while conducting a federal mediation

1005
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,870
就因为这事
because of this.

1006
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,080
那不是我的问题
That's not my problem.

1007
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,380
现在是你的问题了
It's your problem now,

1008
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,880
所以你得签了这个
which is why you're gonna sign this.

1009
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,820
那是什么
What is that?

1010
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,960
是份誓言证词
It's a sworn affidavit

1011
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,220
说明你给吉拉德的钱是借款
stating the money that you paid Gerard is a loan.

1012
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,150
那我的成绩怎么办
Well, what happens to my grade?

1013
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,150
保持原样  因为亨利·吉拉德
It stays the same because Henry Gerard

1014
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,320
没有收钱改成绩
doesn't take money to change grades.

1015
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,770
胡说八道  我们有协议
That's bullshit. We had a deal.

1016
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,100
把这看作你在现实世界的第一课吧
Yeah, well, consider this your first lesson in the real world.

1017
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,650
协议会有变
Deals change.

1018
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,410
我不管什么世界
I don't care what world it is.

1019
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,170
反正我什么也不签
I'm not signing anything.

1020
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,280
那太糟了
That's too bad,

1021
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,570
因为那样  事实会被披露
because the truth will come out.

1022
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,610
照我的办法  你只是挂门课
And this way, you're failing a class

1023
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,160
而不会因贿赂教授
instead of getting thrown out of school

1024
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,650
而被丢出学校
for bribing a professor.

1025
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,170
全任你选了  伊安
It's up to you, Ian.

1026
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,250
你想收下一个不及格成绩
You want an F,

1027
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,420
还是彻底丢掉法律职业生涯
or do you want to not have a legal career at all?

1028
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,840
我签了这个  贿赂指控就没了吗
So I sign this, and the bribery allegations are gone?

1029
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,920
也没人会知道
And no one ever knows a thing.

1030
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,400
但我还得把钱还给伊安
But I still have to pay Ian back the money.

1031
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,320
借款就是这样
That's the way loans work.

1032
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,310
你说话的语气好像我是怪物
You say that like I am a monster.

1033
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,020
我的语气是说那是事实
I say it like it's true.

1034
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,060
你知道吗...
You know...

1035
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,690
你从没让我说明钱是做什么的
you never let me tell you what the money was for.

1036
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,110
你没听懂  我说过我不在乎
You didn't listen to me when I told you I don't care.

1037
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,490
那谁是怪物呢
Who's the monster now?

1038
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,460
我不在乎是因为你总说
I don't care because you always said

1039
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,480
背景情况并不重要
the circumstances don't matter.

1040
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,190
那你在乎迈克盘问我之后
Well, do you care that after Mike grilled me,

1041
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,510
我对他印象深刻
I was so impressed with him

1042
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,240
好奇我为什么会忘记他吗
that I wonder why I'd forgotten him.

1043
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,260
于是我去看了旧档案
So I looked through my old records,

1044
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,160
想看看他成绩怎么样
just to see how he did,

1045
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,950
但找不到任何关于他
but I couldn't find any record of him

1046
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,110
听我课的记录
ever being in my class.

1047
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,070
就像他们也不会找到任何
Just like they're not gonna find any record

1048
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,350
关于你收学生贿赂的记录一样
of you accepting a bribe from a student.

1049
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,230
你是说我们扯平了吗
You saying we're even?

1050
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,770
我说你这回一箭双雕
I'm saying you got a two-for-one,

1051
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,370
因为他们也不会找到任何
because they're also not gonna find any record

1052
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,850
你去年赌博的记录
of you gambling last year.

1053
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,530
所以你那次找我是为这个  对吗
That's why you came to see me back then, isn't it?

1054
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,670
你不希望任何人发现他的情况
You didn't want anyone to find out about him.

1055
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,290
我不会告诉你我去年找你
I'm not gonna tell you why I came

1056
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,960
是为了什么  亨利
to see you last year, Henry,

1057
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,660
因为背景情况不重要
because the circumstances don't matter.

1058
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,330
你确实好好听我的课了
You really did pay attention in my class.

1059
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,050
比你认为的认真多了
A lot more than you think.

1060
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,170
很抱歉我让你失望了  斯佩克特先生
I'm sorry I let you down, Mr. Specter.

1061
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,570
教授...
Professor...

1062
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,300
不用担心还钱的事
don't worry about paying back that loan.

1063
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,120
我来搞定
I got it.

1064
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,960
{\an8}皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特

1065
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,420
路易
Louis...

1066
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,390
有什么需要我帮忙
what can I do for you?

1067
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,240
问题不是我要你帮什么忙  杰夫
The question isn't what you can do for me, Jeff,

1068
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,620
而是你要怎么做
but it's a matter of what you're gonna do,

1069
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,410
也就是告诉你不要胡说八道
which is cut the bullshit right now.

1070
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,060
-什么  -你听到了
- What? - You heard me.

1071
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,750
我知道杰西卡告诉你哈德曼的事了
I know Jessica told you about Hardman.

1072
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,070
是  她是告诉我了
Yeah, she did tell me,

1073
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,840
我也出于礼貌  扼制了自己
and I have refrained from coming to see you

1074
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,980
没有因为你勒索她而去找你
about blackmailing her out of courtesy.

1075
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,800
礼貌
Courtesy?

1076
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,600
你都没有祝福恭喜我
You haven't so much as wished me a congratulations.

1077
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,990
你还想让我祝贺你上位[吻你戒指]  路易
You want me to kiss the ring, Louis,

1078
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,700
在你做了那些事情之后
after what you did?

1079
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,090
说得对  我做了
You're damn right I do,

1080
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,200
因为我不在乎上位的手段
because I don't care how it got up there.

1081
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,990
我的名字现在在墙上
My name is on that wall.

1082
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,310
如果我现在有根撬棍
And if I had a crowbar handy...

1083
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,220
就亲手把它撬下来
I would pry it off.

1084
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,400
杰夫  你没有撬棍
Well, Jeff, you don't.

1085
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,090
所以你该问自己的问题是
So the question you got to ask yourself is,

1086
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,510
"你想继续在团队里吗"
"Do you want to stick with the team?"

1087
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,970
因为我的名字就在墙上
Because my name is up there to stay

1088
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,320
无论你喜欢与否
whether you like it or not.

1089
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,050
多谢你来见我
Thanks for meeting me.

1090
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,500
怎么了
What's going on?

1091
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,720
我想谢谢你让我接了吉拉德的案子
I wanted to thank you for making me take Gerard.

1092
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,170
出什么事了
What happened?

1093
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,390
你为什么会觉得出事了
What makes you think something happened?

1094
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,410
因为我了解你
Because I know you,

1095
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,550
我知道你不会做自我反思
and I know you don't have moments of self-reflection,

1096
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,720
更不会跑出来跟人喝酒告诉他你反思了
let alone have a drink with someone to tell them about it

1097
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,530
除非出了事
unless something happened.

1098
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,000
是有事
You know what? Something did happen.

1099
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,300
我处理了件烂事
I dealt with some shit,

1100
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,140
我想为此谢谢你
and I'm trying to thank you for it

1101
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,280
因为烂事结果变成了好事
because it turned out to be a good thing.

1102
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,740
我觉得你想说的词是"终结"
I think the word you're looking for is "Closure."

1103
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,550
那是你的词
That's your word.

1104
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,880
我想说的是
The word I'm looking for is,

1105
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,110
"不客气  哈维
"You're welcome, Harvey.

1106
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,510
"很高兴听到你说这个"
That's nice of you to say."

1107
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
谢谢  哈维
Thanks, Harvey.

1108
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,420
很好
Good.

1109
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,970
你听我说
Now listen to me.

1110
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,270
有那么一瞬间  我以为
For a minute there, I thought

1111
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,990
你要告诉我他知道了
you were gonna tell me that he knows.

1112
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,590
知道什么
What?

1113
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,890
也许是我偏执
Maybe I'm crazy,

1114
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,170
但我帮他准备证词时  有次他看着我
but when I was prepping him, for a second, he looked at me,

1115
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,250
而我在想
and I thought,

1116
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,480
"他怀疑我了"
"He's suspicious."

1117
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,010
之后你又打电话
And then you called,

1118
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,510
在发生这么多事之后  我...
and after everything that's happened already, I--

1119
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,970
没事  迈克  他不知道
It's fine, Mike. He doesn't know.
