00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,270
{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

17
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,320
我们交往并不违规
There's no violation with us seeing each other.

18
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,840
我不是想要逃避什么惩罚
This isn't something that I am trying to get away with.

19
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,570
而是关于我内心的感受
It's something I'm feeling inside.

20
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,800
而且他再等1个月就假释了
My son was up for parole next month.

21
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,050
他根本就不会和别人打架
He wouldn't have gotten into a fight.

22
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,390
至少有二十名囚犯投诉
There's got to be at least 20 complaints

23
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,120
未能在预定日期顺利出狱
of prisoners being denied their release date.

24
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,480
而且他们每个人都受伤了
And every one of them involves injuries

25
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,760
还被指有一些含混不清的违纪行为
and some kind of vague disciplinary action.

26
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,770
如果我们的律所和本案扯上任何关系
If our firm is in any way associated with that case,

27
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,030
-都会丢一个大客户  -我放弃
- we lose a huge client. - I'm not working on it.

28
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,020
那就出一份书面声明
Then you're gonna put that in writing.

29
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,860
保证你与本案无关
You have nothing to do with this case.

30
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,910
我的工作要求要有个慎重的好名声
My job requires a reputation for discretion.

31
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,280
他不会告诉任何人的
He'll never tell a soul,

32
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,830
你的生意也不会受到影响
and your business will stay intact.

33
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,200
你做冒牌律师这么多年
You lived a lie for years.

34
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,040
你连做一个小案子的秘密都藏不住吗
You can't keep a secret about working one goddamn case?

35
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,340
我们有份工作给你
We have a job we'd like to offer you.

36
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,430
我不跟信不过的人合作
I don't do business with people I don't trust.

37
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,510
你可以帮助他们
You can help these people.

38
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,840
我要五万美元
I want $50,000.

39
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,120
奥利弗  是我  我加入
Oliver, it's me. I'm in.

40
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,540
你给哈维的承诺怎么办
What about your promise to Harvey?

41
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,060
哈维的事我来解决
You let me worry about Harvey.

42
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,090
等等  你要走了
Wait, you're leaving?

43
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,980
怎么不叫醒我
Why didn't you wake me?

44
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,540
因为还有一小时你的闹钟才会响
'Cause you still have an hour before your alarm goes off.

45
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,670
才6:30  你要去哪
6:30. Where are you going?

46
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,310
哈维不可能有事让你这么早去办
There's no way you have something this early for Harvey.

47
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,370
我跟奥利佛有诊所的事
I got something at the clinic with Oliver.

48
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,780
他需要我帮他办一件案子
He needs my help with a case.

49
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,130
等等
Wait.

50
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,330
我今晚想跟你一起吃饭的
I was hoping we could have dinner tonight.

51
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,340
我今晚大概也得去见奥利佛
I probably have to meet with Oliver tonight, too.

52
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,600
那你不如让哈维给你放假
Well, then why don't you ask Harvey for some time off

53
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,510
去处理好你们的工作
to take care of what you're working on?

54
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,260
他已经允许我这么两头跑了
He's already letting me go back and forth.

55
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,670
我不想占便宜
I don't wanna take advantage.

56
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,150
迈克  我就是担心你
Mike, I'm just worried about you

57
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,230
忙过头
burning the candle at both ends.

58
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,780
我们昨晚说过了
We talked about it last night.

59
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,650
不会永远如此的  我保证
It's not gonna last forever. I promise.

60
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,160
好吧
Okay.

61
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,440
继续睡吧
Go back to bed.

62
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,830
奥利佛  我不能在这儿一整天
Oliver, I can't be here all day.

63
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,470
我们赶紧的吧  你安排了什么
So let's get down to it. What do you got?

64
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,530
去布鲁克林  见马克・史蒂文斯
I've got us a meeting in Brooklyn with Marc Stevens.

65
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,630
那是谁
Who's Marc Stevens?

66
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,550
他是我们集体诉讼的18号原告
He is plaintiff number 18 in our class.

67
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,140
-我们约好了九点  -很好
- We're meeting him at nine. - Great.

68
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,240
那么我们就有时间想个说法了
That'll give us time to come up with our cover story.

69
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,700
迈克  我知道严格讲你不能做这个
Mike, I know you're not technically allowed to work on this, 

70
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,610
但这里没人会出卖你的
but no one here is gonna rat you out.

71
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,570
没这么简单  奥利佛  我们说过了
It's not a technicality. Oliver, we've been over this.

72
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,510
我参与这案子可能造成它
Me working on this case means the whole thing

73
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,670
完全被推翻
could get tossed out.

74
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,450
我懂
I get it.

75
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,320
只有两个人知情  我和你
There's only two people in the loop, me and you.

76
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,300
没错  所以如果纳森问起
Exactly. So if Nathan asks...

77
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,460
纳森问起什么
Nathan asks what?

78
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,390
纳森
Nathan.

79
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,380
我就是在跟奥利佛说
I was just telling Oliver

80
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,680
如果你看我看烦了
that if you get sick of seeing me around here,

81
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,050
那也没办法
then he's gonna have to tell you too bad,

82
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,800
我是不会允许布鲁克林经济房
'cause I am not gonna let the Brooklyn Housing Project

83
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,410
继续欺压住户的
keep bullying its tenants.

84
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,670
你自己解决不了那个吗
You can't handle the BHP on your own?

85
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,040
我也行  但有迈克支援更好
I can, but it's nice having Mike give me some backup.

86
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,620
好
Good.

87
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,240
老实说  你让我签了奥利佛的
Tell you the truth, after you made me sign

88
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,630
监狱案的利益冲突放弃书后
that conflict of interest waiver on Oliver's prison case,

89
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,700
我以为你不会再怎么出现了呢
I didn't think you'd be around here that much at all.

90
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,780
还剩什么给我了吗
Is there anything left for me?

91
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,640
没  你起晚了  所以错过了我给你做早餐
No, you slept in late so you missed me making you breakfast.

92
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,990
好啊  但我要说
I see, but for the record,

93
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,150
热速食食物不叫给我做早餐
heating up Pop-Tarts isn't making me breakfast.

94
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,650
那我补偿你一下
Well, how 'bout I make it up to you

95
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,030
不带你去吃午饭吧
and not take you out to lunch?

96
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,810
多谢你的不邀请
I appreciate the non-invitation,

97
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,960
但今天不行
but I can't today.

98
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,880
-得了  为什么  -我有预约
- Come on, why not? - I have an appointment.

99
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,220
你什么时候还中午见客户了
Since when do you see patients at lunch?

100
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,340
不是病人  哈维
It isn't with a patient, Harvey.

101
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,030
是我的律师
It's actually with my lawyer.

102
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,560
什么意思  你的律师
What do you mean, your lawyer?

103
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,360
没事的  就是一个
It's nothing. It's a nuisance suit

104
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,840
前生意伙伴侵害诉讼
from an ex-business partner.

105
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,060
是谁在替你处理
Well, who's handling it for you?

106
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,210
希望你不是要建议
I hope you're not about to suggest

107
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,490
你来替我处理
that you handle it for me.

108
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,130
不是  但我可以替你找第二好的人
I'm not, but I can get you to the next best person.

109
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,230
这人有名字吗
And does this person have a name?

110
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,850
路易・利特
Louis Litt.

111
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,210
就是你揍过的那个
The one you punched in the face?

112
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,840
宝拉  他是最合适的人选
Paula, he's the best man for the job.

113
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,370
听我的  路易是只斗牛犬
I'm telling you, Louis is a pit bull.

114
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,900
谁说我想要斗牛犬了
And who says I want a pit bull?

115
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,790
听着  不管是什么事
Listen to me, if whatever this thing is,

116
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,370
如果已经提起了诉讼
it's reached the level of a lawsuit,

117
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,870
你就会需要路易那样的律师
you're gonna need a lawyer like Louis

118
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,950
不管你想不想
whether you like it or not.

119
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,950
多谢你的担心  哈维
Well, I appreciate your concern, Harvey,

120
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,350
但我更想自己解决
but I prefer to handle this myself.

121
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,770
但如果你还想帮忙
But if you still want to help,

122
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,770
再给我买盒新果馅饼吧
why don't you buy me a new box of Pop-Tarts?

123
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,780
什么味儿都行  只要是草莓味儿的
Any flavor will do, as long as it's strawberry.

124
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,510
太扯了
It was total bullshit.

125
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,130
你是说你没打架吗
Are you saying you didn't get in a fight at all?

126
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,420
没  我是打架了
No, I got in a fight,

127
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,940
但那是为了活命
but it was only to stay alive.

128
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,060
跟我们说说  我们是你这边的
Just tell us what happened. We're on your side.

129
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,070
我本来还有俩月就出来了
Look, I was two months from getting out, okay?

130
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,290
我本打算出狱之前
I was gonna keep my head down

131
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,160
每天都低调做人
every single day until I walked.

132
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,780
一转眼  一个大块头混蛋
Next thing I know, some big-ass son of a bitch

133
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,160
压在了我身上  我却被延长了刑期
is on top of me, and I'm the one that gets extra time?

134
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,510
-他叫什么  -我不知道
- What was his name? - I don't know, man.

135
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,590
我根本不知道
I have no idea.

136
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,400
马克  我不知道你是不是担心报复
Look, Marc, I don't know if you're afraid of payback or something, 

137
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,860
但我们需要知道一切
but we need to know everything if we're gonna--

138
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,530
我不是担心报复
I'm not afraid of no payback, okay?

139
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,720
我真不知道那人是谁
I don't know who he was.

140
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,440
我要是知道  就告诉你了
And if I knew, I would tell you.

141
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,670
那地方夺走了我两年的时间
Look, that place took two years of my life.

142
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,360
之后又加刑两年  就因为偷了几个电视
Two extra years on top of the two for stealing a few TVs.

143
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,660
如果你们要告他们  我想加入
If you're going after them, then I want in on this.

144
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,230
你可以加入  但我在监狱
Then you're in, but I was in prison

145
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,310
待过一段  比你时间短
an even shorter time than you, 

146
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,370
我还知道我囚区所有人的名字
and I still knew all the guys' names on my cellblock.

147
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,930
所以要么他是新来的  要么是你转去了他那里
So either he was new to yours or you were new to his.

148
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,390
不管怎样  我需要知道事情经过
Either way, I need to know what happened.

149
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,420
简单  我那晚去了另一个囚区吃饭
That's easy. I had dinner in a different block that night.

150
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,730
-为什么  -他们叫我去的
- Why did you do that? - 'Cause they told me to.

151
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,700
-谁  -守卫
- Who told you to? - The guards.

152
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,820
他们会一时兴起就公布在墙上
Look, they would post it on the wall whenever they felt like it 

153
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,120
以免我们太安逸了
to keep us from getting too comfortable.

154
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,780
就是说  你不知道是哪个守卫
Which means you don't know the guard

155
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,880
决定让你过去
who decided to move you, 

156
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,160
也不知道跟你打架的人是谁
and you don't know the name of the guy you got in a fight with.

157
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,120
听我的  我没撒谎
I'm telling you guys, man, I'm not lying.

158
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,260
我相信
I don't think you are.

159
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,110
我觉得那是他们的安排
I think they set it up that way.

160
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,010
*看到钱  就愿意留下吃饭*
*See the money, wanna stay for your meal*

161
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,430
*给你太太再拿块馅饼*
*Get another piece of pie for your wife*

162
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,670
*所有人都想知道那感觉*
*Everybody wanna know how it feel*

163
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,050
*所有人都想见见那景象*
*Everybody wanna see what it's like*

164
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,300
*豆子馅饼我也愿吃  我不在乎*
*I'll even eat a bean pie, I don't mind*

165
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,230
*我和妹子忙着赚钱*
*Me and Missy is so busy, busy making money*

166
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,320
*好了*
*All right*

167
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,510
*退开点  我要跳舞*
*All step back, I'm 'bout to dance*

168
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,220
*美钞爵士摇摇摇*
*The greenback boogie*

169
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,110
{\an8}诉讼双雄 第七季 第五集

170
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,310
-路易  -等等
- Louis. - Hold on, man.

171
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,730
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

172
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,000
玩桌面沙包
Playing desktop cornhole.

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,180
能安抚我的情绪
It's supposed to calm my nerves.

174
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,590
好吧  很不想打断你  但我需要你帮忙
Okay, I hate to interrupt, but I need to ask a favor.

175
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,690
随便开口  你需要什么
Anything. What do you need?

176
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,580
你知道我去年一直在见心理医生吧
You know I was seeing a psychiatrist last year, right?

177
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,170
哈维  假如这事有关你的健康
Harvey, if this has to do with your well-being,

178
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,640
我洗耳恭听  但你也知道
I'm all ears, but as you know,

179
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,200
我不是提供心理健康服务的持证从业者
I'm not a licensed practitioner of mental health services--

180
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,280
路易  不是你想的那样
Louis, that's not it.

181
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,880
听着  我的心理医生被告了
Look, my psychiatrist is being sued.

182
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,170
她自己有律师  但我不信任他
She has her own attorney, but I don't trust him,

183
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,490
我想让你接这个案子
and I want you to handle it.

184
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,080
我没明白
I don't understand.

185
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,650
假如你不信任他  你自己为什么不接
If you don't trust him, why aren't you taking it?

186
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,360
我告诉过你了  她是我的心理医生
I told you, she's my therapist.

187
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,330
没错  曾经是
Yeah, was.

188
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,750
这不代表你不能帮她处理法律问题
That doesn't stop you from helping her with a legal issue.

189
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,200
好吧  你想听真相是吧
All right, you want the truth?

190
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,320
我在和她约会
I'm seeing her.

191
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,820
你在和自己的心理医生约会
You're dating your therapist?

192
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,120
听着  我不需要你对我说教  路易
Look, I don't need a lecture from you, Louis.

193
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,370
这可不是说教  哈维
This isn't a lecture, Harvey.

194
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,600
如果你在和自己的心理医生约会
If you're dating your therapist

195
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,710
又被别人发现  可能会害她丢掉执照
and someone finds out about it, she could lose her license.

196
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,200
不  不会的
No, she can't.

197
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,890
我们是在
We didn't start dating until

198
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,790
官方禁止期之后才开始约会的
after the official waiting period was over.

199
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,840
我需要你向我保证
I want your word on that,

200
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,880
因为假如有人问起...
because if someone ever asks--

201
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,980
我向你保证  我不会在这事上撒谎
You have my word. I wouldn't lie about that.

202
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,020
好的  我会去和她谈谈的
Okay, I'll go talk to her.

203
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,000
等等  哈维
But wait a second, Harvey,

204
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,650
唐娜知道你俩的事吗
does Donna have any idea about the two of you?

205
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,300
不  她不知道
No, she doesn't,

206
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,300
目前我想保持这种状态
and for right now I'd like to keep it that way.

207
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,640
偷几台电视蹲了六年  这有问题
Six years for stealing a few TVs, that's not right.

208
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,980
-的确  -我们下一步该怎么做
- No, it's not. - What's our next move?

209
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,700
我们得查明
We gotta figure out

210
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,030
是谁让一个还有两个月就能假释的人
who decided a guy two months from parole

211
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,960
到另一个囚区吃饭的
should eat in a different cellblock.

212
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,000
我们要怎样才能查明啊
How the hell are we gonna do that?

213
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,150
我不知道  奥利佛
I don't know, Oliver,

214
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,050
但如今你得自己一个人去查明了
but right now you're gonna have to work on that yourself.

215
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,600
什么意思  你要去哪里
What are you talking about? Where are you going?

216
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,630
假如我不去上班
If I don't show my face at work,

217
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,360
哈维一定会起疑的
Harvey is gonna get suspicious.

218
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,130
迈克  你确定我们这么做值得吗
Mike, are you sure what we're doing is worth it?

219
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,450
奥利佛  一开始明明
Oliver, you're the one that pushed me

220
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,120
是你推着我管这个案子的
to stick with this in the first place.

221
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,050
你也听见了  他们加倍了他的刑期
You heard that guy, they doubled his sentence.

222
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,530
克里斯・雷耶斯死了
Chris Reyes is dead.

223
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,750
所以是的  值得
Yeah, it's worth it.

224
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,540
你一定是哈维・斯佩克特
You must be Harvey Specter.

225
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,940
谢谢你见我  瑞克
Thanks for meeting me, Rick.

226
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,260
我知道作为称霸能源产业的人你时间宝贵
I know dominating the energy sector is a full-time job.

227
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,020
有话直说  斯佩克特先生
Get to the point, Mr. Specter.

228
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,690
我抽时间见你不是为了听你拍我马屁的
I didn't interrupt my day just so you could kiss my ass.

229
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,330
那让我告诉你你必须见我的原因
Then let me tell you why you did.

230
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,400
洛克伍德能源公司准备发行一种太阳能板
Lockwood Energy is about to release a solar panel

231
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,770
看上去非常像
that looks a hell of a lot like the one

232
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,370
你们开发了好几年的那款
you've been developing for years.

233
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,380
你怎么知道的
How did you know that?

234
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,860
因为我并没有把一整个早上
Because I didn't spend all morning

235
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,820
花在提高我的拍马屁技巧上
brushing up on my ass-kissing techniques.

236
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,490
那你也一定知道洛克伍德的绿色能源部
Then you also know that Lockwood's Green Division

237
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,470
从创立到现在只有三个月
has only existed for three months.

238
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,920
他们偷了那项技术
They stole that technology.

239
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,490
所以你应该签约让我代理
Which is why you should sign with me

240
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,110
这样我就能把它夺回来
so I can go get it back.

241
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,890
我已经签了一家律所了
I already have a law firm.

242
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,670
我为何不让他们来处理这件事
Why shouldn't I let them handle this?

243
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,000
因为你不会想要一个
Because you don't want the guy

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
在洛克伍德偷走了
who's gonna sue Lockwood

245
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,620
你女朋友之后才去告他们的律所
after they've stolen your girlfriend.

246
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,230
你想要的是一个能在洛克伍德行动之前
You want the guy who's gonna put them in the ground

247
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,580
就把他们干掉的律所
before they get the chance.

248
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,890
你倒是挺自信的
You're pretty sure of yourself.

249
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,220
你想要一个不自信的人来处理这事吗
You want someone handling this who isn't?

250
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,100
听着  你何不花一周的时间考虑一下
Look, why don't you take the week to think it over.

251
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,220
当然了  在你纠结的同时
Of course, while you're doing that,

252
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,260
洛克伍德会迅速把你的产品投入市场
Lockwood's gonna be rushing your product to market,

253
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,890
等到那时  你的董事会就会想
and when they do, your board's gonna be wondering

254
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,160
在你有机会的时候你为什么没有雇用我
why you didn't hire me when you had the chance.

255
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,430
好吧  斯佩克特先生  你赢了
All right, Mr. Specter, you win.

256
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,960
你有三天时间
You've got three days.

257
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,080
看看你是不是真有你自己认为的那么好
Let's see if you're as good as you think you are.

258
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,750
你一定就是宝拉・阿加德
You must be Paula Agard.

259
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,290
抱歉  但我们认识吗
I'm sorry, but do we know each other?

260
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,900
暂时还不  但很高兴认识你
Not yet, but it is a pleasure to meet you.

261
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,410
我是路易・利特
I'm Louis Litt, and I understand

262
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,530
听说你在找律师
you are looking for a lawyer.

263
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,860
我有律师  他叫皮特・夏恩珀特
I have a lawyer, and his name's Peter Shumpert.

264
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,660
皮特今天不会来了
Ah, Peter will not be joining you today.

265
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,370
什么
Excuse me? 

266
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,950
我确信他是个好人
I mean, I'm sure he's a nice guy, 

267
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,080
但他不是头牌诉讼律师
but he's not a litigator.

268
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,950
我没看出那一点和这件事有什么关系
Well, I don't see what that has to do with this.

269
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,150
当一名律师让他的客户见了另一名律师
When an attorney lets a client meet with another attorney,

270
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,250
相信我  这说明你需要更好的诉讼代理人
trust me, you need better representation.

271
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,220
我知道你是一名多么优秀的律师  利特先生
I already know what an excellent attorney you are, mr. Litt.

272
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,050
哈维向我推荐你时已经就已经赞美过你了
Harvey said as much when he offered your services.

273
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,420
-那你为什么拒绝他  -因为...
- And why'd you turn him down? - Because...

274
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,180
这件事上有一些东西
there are things about this situation

275
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,860
是我不想和哈维分享的
that I'd rather not share with Harvey.

276
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,660
我完全能够理解
I can understand that completely,

277
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,270
无论是什么事  假如我是你的律师
and whatever they are, if I were your attorney,

278
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,170
我是绝对不会向他透露这些事的
there is no way in hell that he would hear them from me.

279
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,530
我向你保证
That I can assure you.

280
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,910
好吧  好吧  路易
Okay. Okay, Louis.

281
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,350
你可以做我的代理人
You can represent me.

282
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,440
很好  那你先给我讲讲你们之间的过往吧
Good. So let's start by you giving me the history.

283
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,600
这就是重点
Well, that's just it.

284
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,240
我们从前不仅仅只是生意伙伴
We weren't solely business partners.

285
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,000
我们住在一起  我们一起工作
We were living together, we had a practice together.

286
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,190
然后发生什么了
What happened?

287
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,730
他提出分手  伤透了我的心
He broke it off, and he broke my heart.

288
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,350
我把生意中他想要的一切都给了他
I gave him everything in the partnership that he wanted

289
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,190
就是为了离开那一切  离开他
just to be rid of it and of him.

290
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,430
然后呢
And then?

291
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,170
几个我们之前的小组病人对他的治疗反应不佳
Some of our group patients didn't respond well to his treatment,

292
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,920
所以他们开始单独来见我
so they started coming to see me privately.

293
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,360
单独来还是偷偷来
Privately or secretly?

294
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,220
假如你是想问
If what you're asking

295
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,750
我知不知道这样违反了我们之间的协议
is if I knew it was a violation of our agreement,

296
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,860
那么是的  我知道
then yes, I did.

297
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,360
但这些人当时很痛苦
But these people were hurting.

298
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,640
然后凭良心你不能拒绝他们
And you couldn't in good conscience turn them away.

299
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,800
的确  我不能
No, I couldn't.

300
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,530
宝拉  我向你保证
Paula, you have my word,

301
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,610
这事你知我知
this stays between you and me.

302
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,330
谢谢你
Thank you.

303
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,770
奥利佛  告诉我你有发现
Oliver, tell me you found something.

304
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,600
什么都没有
Nothing.

305
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,770
他们有个随机分配狱警的系统
They've got a system that randomly assigns changes from time to time.

306
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,100
那你打来电话干什么
Well, what are you calling me for?

307
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,680
因为我们的案子可能和狱警没关系
Because there might not be a link between our cases and the guards,

308
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,650
但我在斗殴中却有所发现
but I did find one between the fights.

309
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,130
-继续说  -就目前我们手头的20件案子
- I'm listening. - Out of the 20 cases we have so far, 

310
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,700
总共只有四名囚犯参与了斗殴
the fights have been with a total of only four inmates,

311
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,790
我找到了完美的证人  杰马克斯・科林斯
and I got the perfect one, JaMarcus Collins.

312
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,180
他刑期十年  就在C区服刑
He's in the middle of a ten-year sentence

313
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,750
和克里斯・雷耶斯和马克・史蒂文斯
on cellblock C, one over from Chris Reyes

314
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,830
分区相邻
and Marc Stevens.

315
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,930
那我们得去拜访一下科林斯先生了
Well, then we gotta pay Mr. Collins a visit.

316
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,850
我已经安排好了  一个小时后去接你
I've already set it up. I'll pick you up in an hour.

317
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,750
好
Great.

318
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,610
那我们在布鲁克林房屋委员会见面  好
I will see you at the Brooklyn Housing Authority then. Okay.

319
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,270
无论你在做什么  都停下来
Whatever you're doing, put it on hold.

320
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,670
我有个需要唱红白脸的状况  要你帮忙
I've got a good cop/bad cop situation and I need you.

321
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,790
等等  现在吗
Wait, right now?

322
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,020
不  星期四开始数三个月后
No, three months from Thursday.

323
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,740
-好了  走吧  -哈维  我去不了
- Come on, let's go. - Harvey, I can't.

324
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,230
什么叫去不了
What do you mean you can't?

325
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,710
我和奥利佛
I ha--I have a meeting

326
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,670
约好要在布鲁克林房屋委员见面
with Oliver at the Brooklyn Housing Authority.

327
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,500
-我不能把他晾一边  -奥利佛
- I can't leave him hanging. - Oliver?

328
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,920
你刚做了一个无偿案  这有违约定
You just did a pro bono. That's not our deal.

329
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,350
我知道哈维  但我几星期前就在准备了
I know that, Harvey, but I put this in motion weeks ago.

330
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,130
我不知道你会派给我另一件无偿案
I didn't know you were gonna give me another pro bono.

331
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,910
好吧  我自己解决
Fine, I'll handle it myself.

332
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,500
无论你和奥利佛在做什么
Look, whatever you're doing with Oliver,

333
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,340
快点结束
wrap it the hell up.

334
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,610
我招你回来不是让你在我需要时抛弃我的
I didn't bring you back to not be here when I need you.

335
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,690
利普希茨医生  我是路易
Dr. Lipschitz, it's Louis.

336
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,360
我不知道还能怎么说
Look, there's no two ways to say this.

337
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,540
那天晚上我出格了
I was way out of line the other night,

338
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,590
我知道你关心我
and I know you care about me,

339
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,920
并不仅仅是因为你有责任
and not just because you have an obligation to.

340
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,680
所以如果不是太麻烦的话
So if it's not too much trouble,

341
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,230
我想继续我们的治疗
I would like to resume our sessions, please.

342
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,520
请回电  谢谢
Please call me back. Thanks.

343
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,430
路易  我得和你谈谈哈维的事
Louis, I need to talk to you about Harvey.

344
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,290
他怎么了
What about him?

345
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,660
我只是想确定
I just want to make sure that you and he

346
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,100
你们俩之间很好
are on good terms.

347
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,620
是的  唐娜  我们很好
Yeah, Donna, we're on good terms.

348
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,380
你确定吗  因为我们要齐心协力
Are you sure? 'Cause we all pulled together

349
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,910
重新站稳脚跟
to get back on solid footing, 

350
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,800
早些时候我看到你们两个缩在这里
and I saw the two of you huddled up in here earlier, 

351
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
我不想事情朝着
and I'd hate to think that things are going 

352
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,200
错误的方向发展
in the wrong direction.

353
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,850
没有  不是朝着错误的方向的发展  唐娜
No, not going in the wrong direction, Donna.

354
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,200
不必担心
There is no need to worry.

355
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,060
我的确很担心  路易
Well, I do worry, Louis.

356
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,830
因为我知道你现在的心理状态
Because I know what kind of mental state you're still in,

357
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,360
我知道一点点小事也能触及到你
and I know that the slightest thing can touch you off,

358
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,020
-我知道  -唐娜
- and I know that-- - Look, Donna,

359
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,260
跟你说  我们之间很好
for your information, we are on such good terms

360
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,270
哈维...
that Harvey--

361
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,750
哈维怎么了
That Harvey what?

362
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,710
没什么
Nothing.

363
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,580
路易  怎么了
Louis, what's going on?

364
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,120
好了  唐娜
Okay, look, Donna,

365
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,070
我只和你说一次
I'm only gonna tell you this once.

366
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,980
哈维让我帮他处理一件事
Harvey asked me to handle a matter for him.

367
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,870
是私事  他相信我
It's personal. He trusts me with it.

368
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,710
现在  如果你信我的话  你就信我说的
Now, if you trust me at all, you'll take my word for the fact

369
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,770
我们之间很好
that Harvey and I are on good terms.

370
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,490
好
Okay.

371
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,470
我相信你
I trust you.

372
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,410
哈维・斯佩克特
Harvey Specter. 

373
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,900
上次见面我们没有正式介绍
We didn't have a proper introduction the last time we met.

374
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,060
霍莉・科伦维尔
Holly Cromwell.

375
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,900
有何贵干  科伦维尔小姐
What do you want, Ms. Cromwell?

376
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,430
真是没礼貌
So much for formalities.

377
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,800
我很忙
I got a lot on my plate.

378
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,440
没时间讲礼貌
I don't have time for formalities.

379
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,100
如果你带上我  也许就有了
If you brought me on, maybe you would.

380
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,210
你说什么
Excuse me?

381
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,600
猎头公司待遇不够好斯佩克特先生
Headhunting isn't cutting it for me, Mr. Specter.

382
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,790
我想重新入局
I want back in the game,

383
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,160
既然你是我出局的理由
and since you're the reason I'm out of the game,

384
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,850
你应该雇我当你的全职内部顾问
you should hire me as a full-time in-house consultant.

385
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,170
所以你想让我出于内疚救济你吗
So you want me to give you a handout out of guilt?

386
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,440
我不想要救济
I don't want a handout.

387
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,490
但是你承诺不会毁掉我的名声的
But you made me a promise you wouldn't ruin my reputation.

388
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,030
你想让我说什么
What do you want me to say?

389
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,560
你做的事情很危险
What you do is dangerous.

390
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,290
我想让你说你许下了你做不到的诺言
I want you to say you make promises you can't keep.

391
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,910
顺便一提  如果你不觉得我有价值
And by the way, you wouldn't have sent that Rachel woman back to me 

392
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,520
就不会派那个叫瑞秋的女孩再来找我
if you didn't know what I do is worth it. 

393
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,270
首先  我从来没有派过任何人再去找你
Okay, first of all, I never sent anyone back to you.

394
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,970
第二  无论你认为你适合什么样的工作
And second, whatever job you think you're suited for

395
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,320
我的律所都没有这样的职位
doesn't exist in my firm.

396
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,740
贝克・辛姆斯和沃克・斯坦就有
It does at Baker Simms and Walker Stein.

397
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,110
我不会专门为一个唯一的技能
Yeah, well, I'm not looking to make a spot on the payroll

398
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,560
就是越界的人设新岗  开工资的
for someone whose only skill set is crossing lines.

399
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,800
你是说因为你完全可以自己越界
You mean when you cross them so well yourself.

400
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,040
我说了  科伦维尔小姐  我很忙
Like I said, Ms. Cromwell, I got a lot on my plate.

401
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,610
给我一杯麦卡伦  不加冰
Give me a Macallan, neat.

402
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,970
洛克伍德能源公司的股票猛涨
The way Lockwood stock shot up,

403
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,360
为什么不双倍持有呢
why not make it a double?

404
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,140
抱歉  我不认识你
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.

405
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,530
你是在商业事务上班吗
Do you work in Business Affairs?

406
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,420
不  我的工作是因为你想将加尔万达因的
No, I work in suing your ass for trying to pass off

407
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,270
太阳能电池板占为己有告倒你
Galvadyne's solar panels as your own.

408
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,730
我不知道你是谁
I don't know who you are,

409
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,970
我也不知道你在说什么
and I don't know what you're talking about.

410
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,940
但那项技术是我们自己研发的
We developed that technology in-house.

411
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,130
扯淡
Oh, bullshit.

412
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,580
那项技术历时多年才能开发出来
That technology takes years to develop,

413
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,090
而你的整个部门也就从上周二
and your entire division's only been in existence

414
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,180
才开始存在的
since last Tuesday. 

415
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,080
我能说什么呢
What can I say?

416
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,780
当你投资给正确的人才
When you invest in the right talent,

417
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,620
你就是能创造奇迹  据我所知
you can move mountains, and last I checked,

418
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,670
比竞争对手聪明可不犯法
being smarter than your competition wasn't illegal.

419
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,370
如果你有你说的一半聪明
Well, if you're half as smart as you say you are,

420
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,300
现在就会把我们的产品还回来
you'd give us our product back now,

421
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,720
或者我们之后为此夺走你的公司
or we'll take your company from you later.

422
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,190
如果你不是和联调局一起来的话
If you're here without the FBI,

423
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,750
就意味着你是个虚张声势的勒索专家
it means you're just a shakedown artist

424
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,480
你没有一丁点的证据证明你的主张
without a shred of evidence to back up your claims.

425
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,720
不  这意味着我是在给你个改正的机会
No, it means I'm giving you the chance to make it right.

426
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,640
因为我一旦证明了你偷了我们的技术
Because once I prove you stole our technology,

427
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,850
你庆祝的唯一一件事
the only thing you'll be celebrating

428
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,750
就是欺诈重罪的定罪了
is a felony fraud conviction.

429
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,380
谢谢你和我们见面  科林斯先生
Thanks for meeting us, Mr. Collins.

430
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,120
我是奥利佛・格雷迪  这位是我同事
I'm Oliver Grady, and this is my associate.

431
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,460
你的律师同事有名字吗
Your associate got a name?

432
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,790
我的名字没有我要问的问题重要
My name's not as important as the questions I have.

433
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,920
比如为什么去年11月4日
Like why did you incite a brawl in the cafeteria

434
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,110
你在午餐时间在餐厅煽动斗殴
during lunch on November 4th of last year?

435
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,250
搞什么
What is this? 

436
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,770
你们来不是为了谈恢复我假释机会的事吗
I thought you were here to talk about reviving my shot at parole.

437
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,490
我们当然也可以谈那个
We can absolutely talk about that,

438
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,000
在你告诉我们为什么和监狱合谋
after you tell us why you conspired with this prison

439
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,400
延长你狱友的刑期之后
to get your fellow inmates' sentences extended.

440
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,460
扯淡  警卫
This is bullshit. Guard!

441
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,410
听着  你可以不告诉我们
Listen, you don't have to talk to us.

442
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,460
但这件事要曝光
But this thing comes out,

443
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,890
别说五年内出狱
instead of getting out in five years,

444
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,780
你这辈子都得在监狱里呆着了
you're gonna spend the rest of your life in here.

445
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,300
好吧  你们想知道什么
All right, what do you wanna know?

446
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,770
先谈谈是谁让你跟那些快要出狱的人
Let's start with who's telling you to pick fights

447
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,250
挑事掐架的吧
with guys who are about to get out.

448
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,510
没人让我跟别人挑事掐架
Nobody ever told me to pick a fight with anybody.

449
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,910
我只知道  我这片牢房来了新人
All I know is new guy comes into the block,

450
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,830
我就该教训教训他
I'm supposed to teach him a lesson.

451
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,710
没人告诉你的话  你怎么会知道
Well, how do you know that if nobody ever told you?

452
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,290
大概是两年前的事
It happened, like, two years ago.

453
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,670
我和人打起来了  他们把我拖走
I got in a fight with a guy, they dragged me away.

454
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,400
我以为自己要被关禁闭了
Thought they were gonna throw me in Solitary.

455
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,610
结果他们把另一个人关了禁闭
Instead, they threw him in Solitary.

456
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,660
我回到囚室  发现有台全新游戏机
I get back to my cell, brand-new PlayStation in there.

457
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,380
我猜你从没想过要问为什么
And let me guess, you never thought to ask why.

458
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,470
我知道原因  也不想失去我的游戏机
I knew why, and I'm not giving up my goddamn PlayStation.

459
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,390
你愿意出庭作证吗
You willing to testify to that in court?

460
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,200
你们能让我提前出狱吗
You really gonna get me out of here early?

461
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,770
我猜也是
Yeah, I didn't think so.

462
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,930
警卫
Guard!

463
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,920
怎么样
Hey, how'd it go?

464
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,220
如果你想问宝拉有没有同意我代理她
Well, if you're wondering if I convinced Paula to take me on,

465
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,560
答案是同意了
the answer is yes.

466
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,800
我现在是她的律师了
I am her lawyer now.

467
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,270
我们明天上午要和解谈判
We have a settlement meeting tomorrow,

468
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,790
而且我们不能再谈论这件事了
and this is the last we will speak about it ever again.

469
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,580
-路易...  -不  哈维
- Louis-- - No, Harvey.

470
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,430
宝拉现在是我的委托人
Paula is my client now, 

471
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,520
我不想还得一边担心着你因为觉得
and I don't wanna have to worry about you sticking your nose in a case

472
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,880
自己做得比我好要随便插手
that you think you can handle better than me.

473
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,710
-我没觉得...  -要是你能做得比我好
- I don't think-- - Because if you could handle it better than me, 

474
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,910
你就自己做了  但你不能
you would, but you can't,

475
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,450
因为你容易陷入其中  你也明白这一点
because you're too involved, and you know it.

476
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,730
你说得对  你会处理好的
You're right. She's in good hands.

477
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,690
-我不插手了  -还不够
- I'll stay out of your way. - Ah, no. Not good enough.

478
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,530
你得向我保证  否则我这就不干了
I want your word, because I will drop it right now.

479
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,000
好  路易  我向你保证
Okay, Louis, you have my word.

480
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,880
哈维  你和路易还好吧
Harvey. Everything okay with you and Louis?

481
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,920
挺好  怎么了
Yeah. Why?

482
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,480
他说在帮你处理一件私事
'Cause he said he was handling a matter for you,

483
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,820
但他不告诉我是什么
but he wouldn't tell me what it was,

484
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,830
而且五分钟之前我看见你俩
and five minutes ago I saw the two of you

485
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,560
正在激烈讨论什么
having an intense discussion.

486
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,740
一切都好
Everything's okay,

487
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,100
那不是激烈讨论
and it wasn't an intense discussion.

488
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,530
只是战略会谈
It was a strategic meeting,

489
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,050
你不用参与进来
so you don't need to get involved.

490
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,360
我也不想参与进来
I wasn't trying to get involved.

491
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,130
我是来告诉你  瑞克・邓恩
I was coming to tell you that Rick Dunn's

492
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,960
已经在你办公室等了十五分钟了
been waiting in your office for 15 minutes.

493
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,100
十五分钟  你怎么不早点告诉我
15 minutes? Why didn't you come and get me right away?

494
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,000
因为我路过的时候才看到他
Because I only just noticed him when I walked by,

495
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,940
而且我已经不是你的秘书了
and I'm not your secretary anymore.

496
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,930
我是事务所的首席运营官
I'm COO of this firm, 

497
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,100
所以别批评我加班到这么晚了
so instead of criticizing me for working late, 

498
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,730
去看看他要干什么吧
why don't you go see what he wants?

499
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,180
瑞克  要是我知道你要见我
Rick, I could have come to your office

500
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,570
我就去你办公室了
if I'd known you wanted to see me.

501
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,070
要是有人躲着我  我就主动去找他
Well, when someone's avoiding me, I come to them.

502
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,110
没人要躲着你
No one's avoiding anyone.

503
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,330
我想一会给你打电话的
I was gonna give you a call later.

504
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,370
要是你有好消息  早就打电话了
And if you had good news, you'd have done it already.

505
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,480
所以到底发生什么了
So what the hell happened?

506
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,480
你觉得呢  他们什么都不承认
What do you think happened? They denied everything

507
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,860
他们说是自己开发了那项技术
and said they developed that technology on their own.

508
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,720
我不在乎他们说什么
Well, I don't give a shit what they said.

509
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,360
你说过会给我结果
You said you could get me results.

510
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,090
我会给  但我没说一次见面就有结果
And I will, but I didn't say it would take just one meeting.

511
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,700
我来告诉你这次见面之后发生了什么
Well, let me tell you what happened after that one meeting.

512
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,890
他们刚刚宣布  要提前一个月发布
They just announced they're moving up their launch by a month. 

513
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,260
听我说  瑞克
Rick, listen to me.

514
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,560
他们不会提前的
They're not moving anything up.

515
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,290
这只是吓唬人  我向你保证
It's a bluff, and I give you my word,

516
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,500
他们不会把你的产品推向市场
they'll never go to market with your product.

517
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,730
你还是听我说吧
Now you listen to me.

518
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,080
你说一次见面拿不到结果
You said you wouldn't have anything after one meeting.

519
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,360
那你最好能在两次见面之后拿到结果
Well, you sure as hell better have it after two.

520
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,790
否则  我会让所有人知道
Because if you don't, I'm gonna tell everyone in the city

521
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,570
哈维・斯佩克特唯一擅长的
that the only thing Harvey Specter is good at

522
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,780
就是做不能兑现的承诺
is making promises he can't keep.

523
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,500
见鬼
Shit. 

524
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,290
根本没有任何证明囚犯
There's no paper trail 

525
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,010
因为挑事掐架受奖赏的书面记录
proving any inmates were rewarded for picking fights.

526
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,140
好吧  柯林斯不肯说
Okay. Just because Collins didn't talk

527
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,440
不表示其他三个人不会说
doesn't mean the other three won't.

528
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,140
你知道他们也不会说的
Yes, it does, and you know it.

529
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,320
而且他们都没法缓刑
And none of them are close to parole,

530
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,900
所以我们也没法用缓刑来诱惑他们
which means we don't even have that to offer.

531
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,880
好吧  我们再回头看看狱警这边
Okay, then let's go back through the guards again.

532
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,500
我跟你说过行不通
I told you, that's a dead end.

533
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,840
布伦斯维克的监狱由系统随机分配牢房变动
Brunswick has a system of randomly assigning changes.

534
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,660
那就跳出布伦斯维克的范围
Then let's start looking outside of Brunswick.

535
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,330
见鬼
Holy shit.

536
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,370
你说得对
You're right.

537
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,220
他们还有八座监狱
They own eight other prisons,

538
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,590
如果他们在这一座监狱干这种事
and if they're doing this in one--

539
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,640
其他七座监狱肯定也是一样
Then they're doing it at the other seven.

540
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,180
或许有一座监狱不太会掩盖踪迹
And maybe one of them isn't as good at covering their tracks. 

541
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,750
说对了  那赶紧吧
Bingo. All right, let's do it.

542
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,730
因为我现在应该和瑞秋一起吃晚饭
'Cause I'm supposed to be at dinner right now with Rachel,

543
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,500
而不是和你翻文件
not going through files with you.

544
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
你要找哪份
Take your pick.

545
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,470
沃巴什  达尔顿
Wabash, Dalton,

546
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,660
兰伯特  布莱克威尔...
Lambert and Blackwell--

547
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,270
等等  你说兰伯特
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Lambert?

548
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,490
兰伯特惩教所属于改造公司吗
Lambert Correctional Institute is owned by Reform Corp?

549
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,000
怎么了  那里有你认识的人吗
Yeah, why? You know someone there?

550
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,790
不
No.

551
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,520
我知道有人以前在那里呆过
No, I know somebody who used to be there.

552
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,210
他是那种会知道点什么东西的人吗
He the kinda guy who'd know something?

553
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,580
他是那种什么都知道的人
He's the kinda guy that would know everything.

554
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,860
瑞秋  你见迈克了吗  他不在办公室
Rachel, have you seen Mike? He's not in his office.

555
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,750
他早些时候去诊所了
He left earlier this morning for the clinic,

556
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,070
肯定是还在那儿
so he must still be there.

557
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,480
又去了  我让他快点办完那个案子的
Again? I told him to wrap that case up.

558
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,530
哈维  他既履行你的约定又要为
Harvey, he's working hard to live up to your deal

559
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,850
其他客户工作  他很辛苦的
and still come through for his other clients.

560
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,370
我现在需要他
Well, right now I need him,

561
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,840
每次去去他办公室总是看不到他
and I'm getting a little tired of looking into his office

562
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,150
我已经有点烦了
and finding it empty.

563
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,080
或许我可以帮你做点什么
Maybe there's something I can do to help you.

564
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,100
不用
No, it's fine.

565
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,060
告诉他我在找他就好
Just let him know I'm looking for him.

566
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,430
不过既然你提到了  确实有件事
Actually, now that you mention it, there is one thing.

567
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,420
听说你回去找霍莉・科伦维尔了
I heard you went back to Holly Cromwell.

568
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,830
是的  迈克和我去的  有问题吗
Yes, Mike and I did. Is there a problem?

569
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,580
没有
No, there's no problem.

570
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,040
我只想知道她起到作用了吗
I just want to know if she came through.

571
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,660
关于费用的问题  她为难了我们一下
Well, she stuck it to us on the fee a little,

572
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,700
但除此之外  是的  很大作用
but other than that, yeah, she came through.

573
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,490
值得吗
Was it worth it?

574
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,160
这么说吧  他们写的这篇迈克的文章
Let me put it this way, the article they wrote about Mike,

575
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,580
如果没有她  根本就不会成
it never would have existed without her.

576
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,190
竟然是迈克・罗斯
If it isn't Mike Ross.

577
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,460
你应该不是来卖女童军饼干的吧
I take it you're not here selling Girl Scout cookies,

578
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,130
但如果你真的是  给我来两盒去你妈的味
but if you are, I'll take two boxes of go fu-- yourself.

579
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,460
先坐下  加洛
Just sit down, Gallo.

580
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,100
我比你更不想来
I don't want to be here any more than you do,

581
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,460
但我需要你的帮助
but I need your help.

582
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,090
上次我帮了你  结果判了五年
Last time I helped you, I got five years for my trouble.

583
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,890
这个问题我们可能有点办法
Well, maybe we can do something about that.

584
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,590
这是什么
What the hell is this?

585
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,410
这是起诉你之前那间监狱的
That is a lawsuit against your former prison,

586
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,920
起诉他们恶意挑拨犯人斗殴
for starting fights with inmates

587
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,610
以此来延长他们的刑期
so that they could extend their sentences,

588
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,740
我想让你做专家证人
and I want you to be an expert witness.

589
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,100
你是在玩我
You gotta be shitting me.

590
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,600
-弗兰克  -省省吧
- Frank-- - Save your breath.

591
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,140
我不可能做这个的
There's not a chance in hell I'm doing this.

592
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,900
如果我说  我能让你力有所值呢
What if I told you I could make it worth your while?

593
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,640
无所谓
It doesn't matter

594
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,880
因为我根本不懂你在说什么
because I don't know what the hell you're talking about anyway.

595
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,560
胡说  你指望我相信
Bullshit. You expect me to believe

596
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,930
这里的所有狱警都是你的人
that you own all the guards in here,

597
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,450
但上一间监狱有阴谋你就毫不知情
but you didn't know about a conspiracy at your last prison?

598
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,200
你好像知道得不少
Sounds like you know a whole hell of a lot.

599
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,260
你想让我干嘛
What do you need me for? 

600
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,860
我需要有人告诉我全部的事情
I need somebody to tell me everything, 

601
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,960
作为交换  我愿意
and in exchange I am willing to--

602
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,020
我来告诉你你愿意做什么
I'll tell you what you're willing to do.

603
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,130
之前你答应过的
What you promised to do in the first place.

604
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,230
你要把我捞出去
You're gonna get me out of here.

605
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,560
你知道我不行的
You know I can't do that.

606
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,080
放屁  那个叫卡荷尔欠你份大人情
Bullshit. That Cahill guy owes you big time.

607
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,520
你就大大方方走进去
March those pretty little feet in there

608
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,970
把该说的都说了
and say what has to be said,

609
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,860
不然的话  你别想知道一点消息
or you won't know anything about anything.

610
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,990
你在忙这个事的时候
While you're at it, 

611
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,450
下次进来的时候记得给我带个饼干
next time you're here bring me a goddamn cookie.

612
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,240
希望你有时间看看我的和解提议
Hope you had time to look over the settlement offer I sent.

613
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
坦白说  利特先生  价格太低了
To be frank, Mr. Litt, this number's so low,

614
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,160
我们连还价都懒得
we won't even be countering.

615
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,330
我们不会和自己讨价还价的
We're not negotiating against ourselves.

616
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,520
那你是想我回去跟自己谈判吗
Oh, no, you want me to negotiate against myself.

617
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,810
那我也告诉你  这个数字本来应该是0的
Let me tell you something, that number should be zero.

618
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,590
但是阿加德医生愿意花一点钱
But Dr. Agard is willing to pay something

619
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,440
让这件事过去
in order to put this matter behind her.

620
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,850
但她却不愿意来见我  不愿意承认她错了
But she's not willing to face me and own up to what she did.

621
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,280
她所做的  曼宁医生  是在照顾你的病人
All she did, Dr. Manning, was care for your patients.

622
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,260
说明她违反了他们的合伙人协议
Which means she violated their partnership agreement.

623
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,910
根据希波克拉底誓言
And according to the Hippocratic Oath,

624
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,110
对病人的照顾可以取代任何法律协议
patient care supersedes any legal agreement.

625
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,360
她根本不在乎那些病人
She didn't care about those patients.

626
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,940
她只是想偷我的生意罢了
She just wanted to steal my business.

627
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,570
真的吗  那他们为什么会联系她
Really? Then why did they contact her?

628
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,760
你又没有证据
You have no proof of that.

629
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,920
我有  我有电话记录
Yes, I do. I have phone records.

630
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,180
我的客户有道德义务
My client had an ethical obligation

631
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,460
去照顾那些病人
to care for those patients.

632
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,220
那医生不该睡病人的
And what about her ethical obligation

633
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,650
-道德义务呢  -你说什么
- not to sleep with a patient? - What'd you just say?

634
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,060
我知道她和哈维・斯佩克特有一腿
I know that she's been running around with Harvey Specter,

635
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,750
所以他的合伙人来帮她辩护  也不稀奇
and it's no surprise that it's his partner defending her.

636
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,020
阿加德医生的私人生活与本案无关
Dr. Agard's personal life has no bearing on this case.

637
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,450
可有关系了
Oh it'll have plenty of bearing

638
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,350
尤其是道德委员会发现
when the ethics board learn 

639
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,730
她在强制等待期结束前
that she started dating one of her patients

640
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,600
就已经开始和她的一位病人约会了
before the mandatory waiting period elapsed.

641
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,090
这是赤裸裸的谎言
That's a bald-faced lie, 

642
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,820
你是为了勒索我的客户在歪曲事实
and now you're twisting facts in order to blackmail my client.

643
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,430
勒索可是非常严重的指控了
Blackmail is a serious accusation.

644
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,950
我的客户从来没为他的沉默要过任何回报
My client never asked for anything in exchange for his silence.

645
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,610
他刚才那话就是暗示
Well, he sure as shit implied it.

646
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,920
会议结束  利特先生
This meeting's over, Mr. Litt.

647
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,470
你为什么不花一晚冷静一下
Why don't you take the evening to cool down?

648
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,690
好好想想报价
Think of a real number.

649
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,950
伟大的哈维・斯佩克特
The great Harvey Specter

650
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,550
专门从十四街远道而来见我
came all the way below 14th Street to see me.

651
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,390
-荣幸之至  -我能说什么呢
- I'm honored. - What can I say?

652
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,030
有好消息的时候  我喜欢当面说
When I have good news, I like to deliver it face-to-face.

653
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,550
所以是你已经准备好雇我了
Does that mean you're ready to hire me?

654
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,070
还没有  但是如果你帮我搞定一件事
Not yet, but if you take care of something for me,

655
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,410
我应该就没问题了
I just might be.

656
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,030
洛克伍德要发行一款太阳能电池板
Lockwood's launching a solar panel?

657
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,030
他们什么时候涉足可再生能源了
Since when are they in the renewable energy business?

658
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,940
从他们偷了加尔万达因的技术开始
Since they stole the technology from Galvadyne.

659
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,500
不可能  他们没偷
No way. They didn't steal it.

660
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,510
你怎么知道
How can you know that?

661
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,090
因为只有六个人有这个能力
Because there's only six people capable of that kind of work, 

662
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,660
如果他们中有人做了  我会知道的
and if one of them did it, I'd know.

663
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,030
可他们确实拿到了
Well, they got it somehow,

664
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,410
我要知道他们是怎么拿到的
and I need to know how they did it.

665
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,050
好像也不是很难的事嘛
That's not a hell of a lot to go on.

666
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,580
如果我有更多证据  我也不会需要你了
If I had more to go on, I wouldn't need you.

667
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,910
换句话说  你想让我完成不可能的任务
In other words, you want me to do the impossible to audition

668
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,970
来面试一份你昨天说的结果根本不存在的工作
for a job you told me yesterday didn't even exist?

669
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,500
那就把它想成是魔术
Then consider it a magic trick.

670
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,720
你让这个信息弄出来了
You make this information appear,

671
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,450
突然之间  你的工作也出现了
all of a sudden, so does that job.

672
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,460
那就快选一间办公室
Then start picking out an office,

673
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,320
因为下次你再接到我的电话
because the next time you hear from me,

674
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,770
我就要搬进来了
I'm moving in.

675
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,780
你一早上的都去哪儿了
Where the hell have you been all morning?

676
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,360
我去证监会见肖恩・卡荷尔了
I went to see Sean Cahill at the S.E.C.

677
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,440
我不想告诉你的  迈克
I hate to break it to you, Mike,

678
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,040
但证监会对私人监狱没有管辖权
but the S.E.C. doesn't have jurisdiction over private prisons.

679
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,430
我知道  我是在和弗兰克・加洛谈条件
I know that. I was trying to cut Frank Gallo a deal.

680
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,070
他说他会作证了吗
He said he'll testify?

681
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,530
除非拿到假释  但是卡荷尔不给
Not unless he gets parole, and Cahill said no.

682
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,470
说明我们得过一遍加洛的档案
Which means we need to go through Gallo's files,

683
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,670
看能不能找到别的办法放他出来
see if we can find another way to get him released.

684
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,540
迈克  迈克  等一下
Mike, Mike, hold up a second.

685
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,190
加洛的档案说他在丹伯里监狱
Gallo's files said he got an extra five years

686
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,540
因使用致命武器袭击他人而加刑五年
for assault with a deadly weapon while he was at Danbury.

687
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,330
所以呢
So?

688
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,970
所以差不多是在你出来的时候
So that's pretty damn close to when you got outta there.

689
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,290
迈克
Mike.

690
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,580
这是那个之前要杀了你的人吗
Is this the guy who tried to kill you?

691
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,390
-奥利佛  -天呐  迈克
- Oliver-- - Jesus, Mike!

692
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,510
我们不能让这样的人出来
We can't put a guy like that out on the street.

693
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,560
我不是现在就要把他捞出来
I'm not trying to get him out now.

694
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,390
我是让他早两年出来
All right, I'm gonna get him out two years early,

695
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,190
所以从现在算还有五年
which is still five years from now.

696
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,430
而且如果我不这么做
And in the meantime if I don't do that,

697
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,330
又有多少人会像克里斯・雷耶斯一样
how many guys are gonna end up just like Chris Reyes?

698
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,290
现在我担心你会像克里斯・雷耶斯一样
Right now I'm worried about you ending up like Chris Reyes.

699
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,550
如果加洛要对付我
If Gallo is gonna come after me,

700
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,840
不管是五年还是七年  都无所谓了
it doesn't matter if it's in five years or seven.

701
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,650
我的参与很快就会变得太过危险
We only have so long before me working on this becomes too risky, 

702
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,550
所以这是唯一的办法
which means this is the only way.

703
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,030
好的
Okay.

704
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,180
但是我见过你做到了别的律师做不到的事情
But I've seen you do things no other lawyer could.

705
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,930
你有足够的脑子来说服加洛
You're sure as shit smart enough to convince this guy 

706
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,640
接受除假释外的其他条件
to take something besides parole.

707
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,840
你不懂弗兰克・加洛
You don't know Frank Gallo.

708
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,490
但我懂你教我的话
What I know is what you taught me.

709
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,300
每个人都有自己想要的东西
Everybody has something they want.

710
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,590
意味着你只用找到
Which means all you have to do is find out

711
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,970
加洛想要的其他东西  然后满足他
whatever else Gallo wants and give it to him.

712
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,840
路易  怎么样了
Louis, hello. How did it go?

713
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,190
听我说  如果我要做你的律师
Listen to me, if I'm gonna be your attorney,

714
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,000
你就得跟我说实话
I need you to tell me the goddamn truth.

715
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,390
我不喜欢你的语气  我告诉了你实话
I'm not sure I like your tone. I told you the truth.

716
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,550
是吗  因为我得知道
Did you? Because I need to know

717
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,610
在哈维还是你病人的时候
if you started seeing Harvey

718
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,770
你是否就开始跟他约会
while he was still your patient.

719
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,510
什么  没有  谁告诉你的
What? No. Who told you that?

720
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,280
你的前任  他威胁要把这件事告诉委员会
Your ex, and he's threatening to go to the board with it.

721
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,900
如果有任何证据证明...
If there is one shred of proof--

722
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,120
不会有什么证据  因为事情没发生过
There isn't any proof, because it didn't happen.

723
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,390
如果你不愿相信
And if you don't care to believe that,

724
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,480
那你可以直接转身走人
then you can turn around and walk right out.

725
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,490
因为我不屑让一个质疑我人品的人
Because I don't care to be represented by a man

726
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,310
做我的代理律师
who questions my integrity.

727
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,350
好吧  对不起
Okay, I am sorry.

728
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,070
我只是不喜欢措手不及
I just don't like being blindsided.

729
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,380
那我很高兴你受的惊吓已经过去了
Well, I'm glad your shock is behind you,

730
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,610
但我受的还没有
but mine isn't.

731
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,100
你说他会告诉委员会是什么意思
What do you mean he's going to the board?

732
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,000
他以此作为威胁
I mean he is blackmailing you

733
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,050
想要敲诈你
with the threat of going to the board.

734
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,030
什么
What?

735
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,390
这会毁了我的事业
That would ruin my career.

736
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,860
我知道  所以你现在得告诉我
I know, which is why you need to tell me

737
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,190
你和雅各布之间到底发生了什么
what really happened between you and Jacob now.

738
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,380
路易  说这个我会感觉不舒服
Louis, I don't feel comfortable doing that.

739
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,270
抱歉  宝拉  但你必须这样做
I'm sorry, Paula, but you're gonna have to,

740
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,790
因为反驳他的唯一辩词
because the only defense against what he is trying to do

741
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,030
就是真相
is the truth.

742
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,190
当我告诉你他伤了我的心
When I told you he broke my heart,

743
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,430
我说的就是真相
I was telling the truth.

744
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,680
但我没告诉你的是在那之后
But what I didn't tell you was that after that

745
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,900
他改变了心意
he changed his mind.

746
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,000
唐娜  我需要你为一名新员工
Donna, I need you to draw up some paperwork

747
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,140
起草入职文件
for a new employee.

748
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,790
我明天一大早就办
I'll get to it first thing in the morning.

749
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,200
等等
Wait a second,

750
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,730
我们为什么要请霍莉・科伦维尔做顾问
why are we bringing on Holly Cromwell as a consultant?

751
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,830
因为她很厉害  而且我不想每次要她帮忙
Because she kicks ass, and I don't want to have to track her down

752
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,630
都得费劲去找她
every time I need her help with something.

753
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,450
哈维  我认为这是个错误的决定
Harvey, I think this is a mistake.

754
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,950
这我说了算
Well, it's my call.

755
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,440
不  事实上你不能说了算
No, actually it isn't.

756
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,530
你说什么
Excuse me?

757
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,560
我说过  我不再是你的秘书了
I told you, I'm not your secretary anymore.

758
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,900
我现在是首席运营官  你提拔我是有原因的
I'm COO, and you made me that for a reason.

759
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,710
我很会看人  然后我告诉你
I know people, and I'm telling you it's reckless

760
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,530
雇用一个有背叛雇主经历的人
to hire someone who betrayed her employer

761
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,850
相当轻率
the first chance she got.

762
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,920
唐娜  我向她保证过
Donna, I gave her my word

763
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,590
如果她帮忙我就雇用她
I'd do this if she came through,

764
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,560
她会帮忙的
she's gonna come through,

765
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,100
而且我已经对她失信过一次了
and I already broke my word to her once.

766
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,610
或许你不该向一个不是律师的人
Well, then maybe you shouldn't promise a job

767
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,030
承诺一份律所工作
at a law firm to someone who isn't a lawyer.

768
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,860
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

769
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,810
你就不是个律师  我也提拔你了
You're not a lawyer, I just promoted you,

770
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,040
依我说  结果还相当不错
and that worked out pretty damn well if you ask me.

771
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,350
你是在我证明了对律所的忠诚后
And you only did that after I proved

772
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,510
才这么做的
my loyalty to this firm.

773
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,930
那现在她也会证明她的忠诚
And she's gonna start proving her loyalty now.

774
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,720
需要我提醒你...
Need I remind you that--

775
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,460
提醒我你是老大吗  不  你不用
That you're in charge? No, you don't.

776
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,860
而且如果你想告诉我
And if you try to give me your,

777
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,840
"这事不需要投票表决"这种鬼话
"This isn't something we vote on" Bullshit,

778
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,550
我会找到路易  马上带他过来
I will find out where Louis is, and I will bring him

779
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,050
再带上一份公司章程
down here right now with a copy of the bylaws,

780
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,210
因为我敢肯定这就是我们需要投票表决的事
because I am betting it is something we vote on.

781
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,370
好吧  唐娜  你赢了
Okay, Donna, you win.

782
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,240
你不想雇她  那就不雇
You don't wanna hire her, we won't.

783
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,180
但这件事做决定的是你
But you wanna be the one to make that call,

784
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,370
那也由你来当面拒绝她
you're gonna be the one to tell her to her face.

785
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,850
饿了吗  厨房里还剩有一些泰国菜
You hungry? There's some leftover Thai in the kitchen.

786
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,170
太好了  我饿死了  一整天没吃饭了
Great, I'm starving. Haven't eaten all day.

787
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,080
迈克  我知道我说过
Mike, about that, I know I said that maybe

788
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,730
也许你该请求哈维给你点休息时间
you should ask Harvey for a little time off

789
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,790
来帮助诊所
to help with the clinic,

790
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,720
但我在想是否
but I'm wondering if maybe

791
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,950
你也该从诊所
you should take a little time off

792
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,180
争取点休息时间来帮助哈维
from the clinic to help Harvey.

793
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,070
-瑞秋  -他今天在找你
- Rachel-- - He was looking for you today,

794
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,870
而且显然不是第一次了
and it was clear it wasn't the first time.

795
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,210
你自己说过  当初他能答应
And you said yourself, he was nice enough

796
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,800
这笔交易已经很宽容了
to make this deal in the first place,

797
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,960
所以也许是时候记住他的好了
so maybe it's time to remember that.

798
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,710
我没忘记过
I do remember that.

799
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,140
我们现在不会一起完成每一个案子
It's not like we work on every case together.

800
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,360
他知道的
He knows that.

801
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,040
我也知道
And I know that, too.

802
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,890
但他让你回律所是有原因的
But he brought you back for a reason,

803
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,440
所以当他真的需要你的时候
and that's so that when he does need you,

804
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,520
你得在
you'll be there.

805
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,630
你说得对
You're right.

806
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,940
我只是...在处理布鲁克林房屋的案子
I'm just--I'm working on this Brooklyn Housing thing,

807
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,580
有截止期限
and there's a deadline.

808
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,580
但这事一结束
But as soon as it is over,

809
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,900
我就暂时不去诊所了
I will take a break from the clinic.

810
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:41,950
我保证
Promise.

811
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,250
好
Okay.

812
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,080
你买了我爱吃的春卷吗
Now, did you get the spring rolls that I like?

813
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,300
有
Yes.

814
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,290
没有  可能没了吧
No. Maybe?

815
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,090
你吃光了  对吗
You ate them all, didn't you?

816
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,040
它们都在呼唤我的名字
Well, they were calling out my name.

817
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,740
-每次都这样  -你知道的
- Every time! - You know that.

818
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,550
都是调味汁的错
It's the sauce!

819
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,310
路易  我们以前从未讨论过案子的细节
Louis, we've never discussed the specifics of a case before.

820
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,850
为什么你突然觉得这个案子如此重要
Why do you think this one is so important all of a sudden?

821
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,030
我不知道
I don't know.

822
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,030
她一直在对我说关于这个人
She kept telling me all these horrible things

823
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,310
所有可怕的事  但是...
about this guy, but...

824
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,580
但是什么  路易
But what, Louis?

825
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,300
她还告诉我
She also told me that

826
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,770
他做这一切只想让她回到自己身边
all he wanted to do was get her back.

827
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,840
她为他感到很遗憾
She felt sorry for him.

828
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,620
我想我也为他感到遗憾
I guess I felt sorry for him, too.

829
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,640
为他还是为你自己遗憾
Sorry for him or for yourself?

830
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,900
你在说些什么
What are you talking about?

831
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,330
路易  我讨厌拿你做类比
Louis, I hate to draw comparisons for you,

832
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,990
但有没有可能你把自己
but is there a chance you're putting yourself

833
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,100
代入了这个男人的处境  因为他的遭遇
in this man's shoes because it's so similar

834
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,750
很像你和塔拉的经历
to what happened between you and Tara?

835
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,140
-我没有背叛她  -但你表现很差
- I didn't cheat on her. - But you behaved poorly.

836
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,560
因此结束了恋情  而你想要她回来
It ended the relationship, and you wanted her back.

837
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,770
我说过我不想再
And I told you that I do not want

838
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,400
谈论和塔拉做了结的事
to talk about getting closure with Tara anymore.

839
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,740
我知道  路易  但不断向你提起这事
I know that, Louis, but it is my duty

840
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,250
是我的责任
to keep bringing it up to you.

841
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,070
否则我们为什么还要见面
Otherwise, why are we seeing each other?

842
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,910
好吧  那么  医生
Okay, then, Doc,

843
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,000
说实话  我不认为是这个原因
honestly, I don't think that's it.

844
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,900
那你去做你知道你该做的事
Then you shouldn't have any trouble

845
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,020
应该也没什么困难
doing what you know you have to do.

846
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,250
-霍莉  对吧  -是的
- Holly, right? - Yes.

847
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,450
唐娜・鲍尔森  谢谢你这么早见我
I'm Donna Paulsen. Thanks for meeting me so early.

848
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,700
没事  我们可以私下交流交易要点
No problem. We can go over the deal points informally,

849
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,080
但我需要在我签名前  先让我的
but I will need my lawyer to take a look at the contract

850
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,780
律师过目
before I sign.

851
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,730
事实上  我还有几个问题
Actually, I have a few questions for you first.

852
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,180
什么问题
What kind of questions?

853
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,080
判断你是否
The kind that determine

854
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,280
适合皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特的问题
if you're Pearson Specter Litt material.

855
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,030
你叫我来不是为了讨论我的合同吧
I'm not here for my contract, am I?

856
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,490
我来是因为你对我有意见
I'm here because you have a problem with me.

857
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,730
我是对你有意见
I do have a problem with you.

858
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,200
我明白了  我早该知道的
I see what this is. I should have known.

859
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,600
我有沃顿商学院的工商管理硕士学位  荣誉毕业
I have an MBA from Wharton, I graduated with honors,

860
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,390
你就觉得我只是个高价...
and you think all I am is a high-priced--

861
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,280
不  我才不在乎你对男人和性的态度
No, I don't give a shit what you think about sex and men.

862
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,170
我的问题是你做的生意有背叛惯性
My problem is that you're in the betrayal business.

863
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,530
你背叛你看上的男人
You betray the men that you prey on,

864
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,710
而我们和你的唯一一次接触中
and then the only time we had an interaction with you,

865
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,120
你也背叛了你的雇主
you turned on your employer.

866
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,570
那你为什么不向你的雇主提这个问题
Well, why don't you bring that up with your employer?

867
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,550
因为就是他让我处于了那个处境
Because he's the one who got me in that position.

868
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,060
那是我第一次  也是最后一次这么做
It was the first and last time I ever did anything like that,

869
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,720
而且为此我还失去了工作
and I lost my livelihood because of it.

870
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,920
这我倒不知道
I didn't know that.

871
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,230
谨慎和正直是我工作的基础
Discretion and integrity were the foundations of my business.

872
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,150
你的老板摧毁了它们  所以我不喜欢
Your boss knocked them down, and I don't appreciate you

873
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,670
你来质疑我是否一开始就具有这些品质
questioning whether or not they were there in the first place.

874
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,860
这是什么
What's this?

875
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,790
这是我本来打算交给我新雇主的东西
That is what I thought I'd be delivering to my new employer.

876
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,600
这正是哈维需要的东西
This is exactly what Harvey needed.

877
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,980
你怎么弄到的
How the hell did you get this?

878
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,730
我做的  是艺术
What I do is an art.

879
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,750
我能发现人们的需要  恐惧
I find out what people want, what they're afraid of,

880
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,140
他们的命门  然后加以利用
what makes them tick, and I use it.

881
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,510
他们不会知道整体局面
And they never know the big picture,

882
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,140
所以他们会给我我需要的  还毫不知情
so when they give me what I need, they think it's nothing.

883
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,900
等你把这些碎片拼起来
And then when you put all the pieces together,

884
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,940
就成了你的委托人需要的东西
it adds up to exactly what your clients are looking for.

885
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,390
那是我保证哈维弄到的东西
That's everything I promised I'd get Harvey,

886
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,260
而且只用了不到一天
and it took me less than a day.

887
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,880
我遵守了承诺
I kept my word.

888
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,900
我的饼干呢
Where's my cookie?

889
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,460
给你带了比饼干更好的东西
Brought you something better than a cookie.

890
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,920
你也曾是改造公司的犯人
You were a prisoner under Reform Corp, too,

891
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,380
也就是说现在你也是集体诉讼的一员了
which means you are now a member of the class.

892
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,850
赢了这场官司  等你出狱时就不是
We win this, you're not Brooks Hatlen bagging groceries

893
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,290
就不再是为食物发愁布鲁克斯・哈特兰
at the Food-Way when you get out.

894
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,040
而是躺在墨西哥沙滩上的安迪・杜佛兰
You're gonna be Andy Dufresne sitting on a beach in Mexico

895
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,040
{\an8}两人都是电影《肖申克的救赎》里的人物
后者是男主人公

896
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,910
带着一个满满的钱包
with a bank account full of cash.

897
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,640
我在这里本来过的就不错
I already make a nice living in here.

898
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,230
确实  但我觉得这笔钱的一部分
You do, but I was thinking maybe some of that money

899
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,240
-可以给你女儿  -你说什么
- might go to your daughter. - What'd you just say to me?

900
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,530
我做了调查  弗兰克  我知道你和她不来往了
I did some digging, Frank. I know you don't talk to her.

901
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,940
她的处境不好  这么多钱
And she is not doing great, and this much money

902
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,420
可以彻底改变她的生活
could really change her life.

903
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,950
如果你这是耍我...
If you're playing with me on this thing--

904
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,230
我没有耍你  弗兰克
I'm not playing you, Frank.

905
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,820
我没有想以此威胁你
And I'm not trying to bully you with this.

906
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,160
我是想帮你
I'm trying to help you.

907
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,370
我们是有协议
We had an arrangement.

908
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,240
直接由监狱代理的吗
Brokered directly by the prison?

909
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,650
开始不是  但我看出了规律
Not at first, but I saw the pattern.

910
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,830
打伤人就有奖
Break some skulls, get a reward.

911
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,060
所以我找到了源头  谈正式协议
So I went to the source to get things codified.

912
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,370
-成功了吗  -是的
- And did you? - Yeah.

913
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,210
弄清了事情的内幕
Found out what was what.

914
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,820
开始挺好  后来我意识到
It was good at first, then I realized

915
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,450
那就像为黑帮做事
it was like working for the mob.

916
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,880
拿到时是份好工作  但不能辞职
Great work while you can get it, but you can never quit.

917
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,110
所以我想抽身
So I tried to put an end to the whole thing.

918
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,540
那晚狱警关了监控
That night the guards killed the cameras,

919
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,260
五个我所谓的朋友揍了我一顿
and five of my so-called friends did a number on me.

920
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,830
等等  你是在说让你来了
Wait a second. Are you saying this the deal

921
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,910
丹伯里的交易吗
that got you to Danbury?

922
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,130
你已经告发过这个人了吗
You already informed on this guy?

923
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,500
没有  你吃白痴吗
No, what are you, nuts?

924
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,030
没人在乎犯人的待遇
No one cares how prisoners are treated.

925
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,290
我告发的是真正犯了罪的一个罪犯
I informed on real guys about real crimes.

926
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,350
所以才出来了
That's how I got out.

927
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,860
你愿意把这些话作为呈堂证供吗
Are you willing to go on the record with this?

928
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,030
告诉我你的消息来源
Tell me your source?

929
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,230
没那么简单  小迈克
It's not gonna be that easy, Mikey.

930
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,730
我需要你预付我和解费
I'm gonna need an advance on that settlement.

931
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,430
请坐
Please, sit down.

932
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,990
很高兴你带了有诚意的数字  利特先生
Glad to see you've come back with a real number, Mr. Litt.

933
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:53,800
我唯一带来的
The only number I'm back with

934
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,510
就是教训你的委托人的打算
is the one that I'm gonna do on your client.

935
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,470
搞什么  你说他打算开支票了的
What the hell? You said he was ready to cut a check.

936
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,090
她应该告诉你的是  雅各布
Oh, well, what she should have told you, Jacob,

937
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,760
你勒索别人
is when you threaten someone with blackmail,

938
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,760
最好是准备好迎战的
you better goddamn be ready to defend yourself.

939
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,710
你最好注意对我委托人的用词
And you better watch how you talk to my client.

940
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,630
你的委托人就是个撒谎  出轨的混蛋
You client is a lying, cheating piece of shit,

941
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,520
他起诉前任的唯一动机就是报复
whose only motive for suing his ex is to get revenge.

942
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,310
-她破坏了我们的约定  -不  是你破坏在先
- She broke our agreement. - No, you broke your agreement

943
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,570
你出轨两个月
when you had an affair for two months

944
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,910
还打算离开她就是破坏约定
and you thought you were gonna leave her.

945
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,300
那件事和本案无关
That has nothing to do with this suit.

946
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,440
那件事和本案关系很大
It's got everything to do with this suit.

947
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,910
你看  是你搞砸了  你改了主意
You see, you messed up. You changed your mind

948
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,140
但当她决定断绝关系
and you wouldn't take no for an answer

949
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,010
你又不愿意  所以这一年来
when she ended it, and that's why you've been

950
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,440
你才一直跟踪她
stalking her for the last year.

951
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,980
我没有跟踪她
I haven't been stalking her.

952
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,500
瞧瞧  宣誓书上下册
Bang. Signed affidavits one and two.

953
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,270
和你无中生有的指控不一样
Unlike your bullshit accusations,

954
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,650
我有实在的证据  从你雇来
I have actual proof from the agency

955
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,310
跟踪她的机构  到报刊亭那个作证
that you hired to follow her, to the guy at the news stand

956
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,940
你每天有一半时间站在那里盯着她的公寓
who says you stand there half the day watching her building.

957
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,750
雅各布  这是真的吗
Jacob, is this true?

958
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,830
是真的  他自己心里清楚
It is true. He knows it's true.

959
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,530
这可是D级重罪  医生
And that is a Class D felony, Doctor.

960
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,350
我应该报警抓你
I should have you arrested,

961
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,900
或者  我应该去医师协会
or maybe I'll just go to the board,

962
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,410
吊销你的执照
have your license removed.

963
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,530
我们本来应该拥有幸福的生活
We were going to have a life together.

964
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,840
我把一切都计划好了
I planned everything out.

965
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:08,950
我们要在哪里生活  生几个孩子
Where we were going to live, how many kids we'd have,

966
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,230
结婚纪念日去哪里过
where we'd go on our anniversary.

967
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,060
我就犯了一个错误
And then I make a mistake,

968
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,250
紧接着
and the next thing I know,

969
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,770
这整个生活都没了
my whole life was gone.

970
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,060
我们撤诉
We'll be dropping the suit.

971
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,390
你找奥利佛吗
You looking for Oliver?

972
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,700
纳森  你好
Nathan, hey.

973
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,850
是啊  我有些事
Uh, yeah, just had some things

974
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,940
要跟他说
that I wanted to run by him.

975
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,920
布鲁克林租房案还是监狱诉讼案
On the Brooklyn Housing case or on your prison lawsuit?

976
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,190
纳森  我没办法...
Look, Nathan, I had to

977
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,180
迈克  镇定
Mike, come on, relax.

978
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,620
我没生气
I'm not angry.

979
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,770
虽然我现在是很想把你的表情拍下来
Though I do wish I had a picture of your face right now.

980
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,610
-你怎么看出来的  -逗我吗
- What tipped you off? - Come on, are you kidding me?

981
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,090
你签下那个协议的时候
I mean, the second you signed that agreement,

982
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,230
我就知道你会后悔
I knew you'd go back on it.

983
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,780
那你为什么不揭穿我
So then why didn't you say anything?

984
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,700
因为这次你要坑的人不是我
Because this time you're screwing over

985
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,090
是哈维・斯佩克特
Harvey Specter and not me.

986
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,850
要么你打赢案子
Look, you're either gonna win this thing

987
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,790
我们得利
and we're gonna get all the credit,

988
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,320
要么你事情败露被抓
or you're gonna get caught with your hand

989
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,940
那我们撤诉
in the cookie jar, and we'll drop the case.

990
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,440
对我没什么损失
I have no downside.

991
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,490
奥利佛知道吗
Does Oliver know?

992
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,860
知道  我假装生气
Yeah, yeah, I pretended to be pissed at him

993
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,130
赶他回家了
and sent him home.

994
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,390
迈克  回家好好休息
Look, Mike, why don't you take the night

995
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,850
想想你为我赢得了多少尊重
and think about how much respect you just gained for me,

996
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,830
明早再来大杀四方
then come back and kill it in the morning.

997
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,880
谢谢你  纳森
Thanks, Nathan.

998
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,050
不客气  迈克
You're welcome, Mike.

999
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,230
唐娜  今晚回家前
Donna, before you go home tonight,

1000
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,130
我需要你给我替霍莉开张支票
I need you to cut me a check for Holly.

1001
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,320
什么意思  给她的钱都在工资里了
What do you mean? I'm gonna put her on the payroll.

1002
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,720
她不来这里工作了
She doesn't want to work here anymore.

1003
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,640
她说宁愿做一次性工作
Said she'd rather do one-off jobs if at all.

1004
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,740
这是金额
Here's the amount.

1005
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,310
我不明白  我不反对她来了
I don't understand. I was good with having her.

1006
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,110
不管你说了什么  让她不愿意来了
Well, whatever you said made her not good with having us.

1007
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,960
哈维  我们是个紧密的团队
Harvey, we're a tight-knit group.

1008
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,350
我们不背叛对方
We don't betray each other

1009
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,520
也没有事隐瞒对方
and we don't keep secrets from each other.

1010
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,020
我必须知道她的立场
I had to find out where she stood.

1011
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,400
如果代价是她拒绝来这里
And if the cost of that was her not coming here,

1012
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,730
那我也不后悔
then I don't regret it.

1013
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,000
我理解  唐娜
I understand, Donna.

1014
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,490
我不是在责怪你
I'm not coming down on you.

1015
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,740
我只是需要支票
I just need the check.

1016
00:37:59,010 --> 00:37:59,890
哈维  是不是这个女人
Harvey, is there something

1017
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,410
还有什么事是你没告诉我的
that you're not telling me about this woman?

1018
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,340
因为最近觉得你变了个人
'Cause it seems like you've been different lately,

1019
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,350
我不知道
and...I don't know.

1020
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,370
和她没关系
It's nothing about this woman.

1021
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,120
我只是以为她会是个很好的员工
I just thought she'd be a good addition.

1022
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,520
这种事很正常
These things happen.

1023
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,690
有意思
It's funny.

1024
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,060
我很爱我的新工作  但我很怀念这样
I love my new position, but I miss this.

1025
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,210
我也怀念
I miss it, too.

1026
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,940
要我给你倒点喝的吗
You want me to pour us a couple drinks?

1027
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,560
或许明天吧
Maybe tomorrow night.

1028
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,200
现在我还有事要办
I have something I have to deal with right now.

1029
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,320
好
Okay.

1030
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,130
我给你开支票
I'll cut you that check.

1031
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,920
你是对的  医生
You were right, Doc.

1032
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,050
我一直没有处理塔拉的事
I hadn't really dealt with Tara.

1033
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,050
但有一件事很明确
But one thing is clear.

1034
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,860
这个状况是我造成的
The situation was my doing.

1035
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:49,930
也就是说
Which means...

1036
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,790
我应该开始解决自己的问题了
I need to keep working on myself,

1037
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,370
因为
because...

1038
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,990
我不想再搞砸我的下一段认真恋情了
I don't wanna mess things up with the next Tara.

1039
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,660
路易  一般我是
Louis, typically I refrain

1040
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,920
避免对我的患者说这种话的  但是
from saying things like this to my patients, but...

1041
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,050
我为你骄傲
I am proud of you.

1042
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,100
晚安  医生
Good night, Doc.

1043
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,930
晚安  路易
Good night, Louis.

1044
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,420
有时间再见一个患者吗
Time for one more appointment?

1045
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,670
你好  你怎么来了
Hello. What are you doing here?

1046
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,830
我想带你出去庆祝
I wanted to take you out and celebrate.

1047
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,550
路易都告诉我了
Louis told me what happened.

1048
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,970
我刚跟他通完电话
I just got off the phone with him.

1049
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,560
他干得很好
He did an amazing job.

1050
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,220
而你推荐了他也算干得不错
And you did an amazing job recommending him.

1051
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,820
为什么没告诉我雅各布的事
Why didn't you tell me about Jacob?

1052
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,160
我让路易别告诉你的
I asked Louis not to tell you that.

1053
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,850
-路易没有  -那你是怎么...
- Louis didn't tell me. - Well, then how do you--

1054
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,940
我就是知道  但我只是希望
Because I do, and all I could think of

1055
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,690
你能给我足够的信任  相信我
was I wish you trusted me enough to know

1056
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,700
不会为他对你做的事去找他麻烦
that I wouldn't go nuts on this guy for what he did to you.

1057
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,560
你以为我不告诉你是这个原因吗
Is that why you think I didn't tell you?

1058
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,360
你确实了解我和不忠的人的渊源
Well, you know my history with infidelity.

1059
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,440
还有什么原因
What else could it be?

1060
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,830
哈维  他背叛了我
Harvey, the man cheated on me.

1061
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:07,470
我信任了他  他却背叛了我
I trusted him, and he cheated on me,

1062
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:11,070
我是担心你因为这件事会对我产生的看法
and I was afraid of how you'd see me.

1063
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,120
他背叛你我为什么会对你产生不同看法
Why would him cheating on you make me see you differently?

1064
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,440
因为有些人认为
Because some people think that a woman

1065
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,720
会被人背叛的女人
who can be cheated on can't be...

1066
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,770
不可爱
loveable.

1067
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,580
你这么了解我  怎么还会这么想
How can you know me and think that?

1068
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,690
但事不关你  而是我
Well, it's not about you. It's about me.

1069
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,990
如果这个人这么对你
And if this guy did this to you,

1070
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,860
说明他是个白痴  是他
then he's an idiot, and all he did

1071
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,950
失去了一个很宝贵的东西
is lose out on something great.

1072
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,410
居然觉得自己不可爱
Not loveable?

1073
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,020
心理医生也不是什么都知道的
Psychiatrists don't know everything, you know.

1074
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,660
我发现了
I'm starting to realize that.

1075
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,260
你真是夜以继日啊
You really are burning the candle at both ends.

1076
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,820
给我的吗
Hey. Is this for me?

1077
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,530
你都忙得没法回家吃晚饭了
Since you were too busy to come to dinner,

1078
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,910
我就想  只能让晚饭去找你了
I thought, why can't dinner come to you?

1079
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,020
我没懂  什么叫晚饭来找我
I don't understand. What do you mean, come to me?

1080
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,640
我带它去诊所找你了  迈克  你不在
I brought it to the clinic, Mike, but you weren't there.

1081
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,920
肯定是我还没回去呢
I just--I must have not been back yet.

1082
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,940
从哪里
Back from where?

1083
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,250
是布鲁克林的养老院
Was it the nursing home in Brooklyn

1084
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,880
还是住房部
or was it the Department of Buildings?

1085
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,320
因为奥利佛  他好像不确定是哪个
Because Oliver, he couldn't seem to decide which.

1086
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,160
-瑞秋  我...  -迈克  如果你
- Rachel, I didn't-- - Mike, if you can't tell me

1087
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,320
不告诉我怎么回事  只会让我去想
what's going on, I'm gonna start to wonder

1088
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,660
你还有什么别的事瞒着我
what else you've been keeping from me.

1089
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,550
我确实是在跟奥利佛办案
I wasn't lying about working a case with Oliver.

1090
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,490
我只是没告诉你是哪件
I just didn't tell you which one.

1091
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,600
监狱案
The prison one.

1092
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,270
-是的  -你签了协议
- Yeah. - You signed an agreement.

1093
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,160
这是要被辞退的
This is a fireable offense.

1094
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,520
哈维不会就为这解雇...
Harvey isn't gonna fire me for--

1095
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,530
-但也许他应该  -你怎么这么说
- Okay, but maybe he should. - How can you say that?

1096
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,210
因为你在利用他对你的信任
Because you're taking advantage of his trust,

1097
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,370
别说还有我的
not to mention mine.

1098
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,050
瑞秋  这些犯人被利用来榨取钱财
Rachel, these prisoners are being exploited for money.

1099
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,100
你在做对的事
And you trying to do the right thing

1100
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,180
不代表你就可以打破承诺
doesn't change the fact that you gave your word.

1101
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,300
-瑞秋  -听着
- Rachel-- - Look...

1102
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,350
我们走过这么多风风雨雨
We've been through enough for you to know

1103
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,200
出了这件事也不代表我明天就不爱你了
that I'm still gonna love you in the morning,

1104
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,760
但你应该扪心自问
but you have to ask yourself:

1105
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,320
你的承诺有没有价值
What is your word worth?

1106
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,110
因为就目前的事情来看
'Cause with the way things are going,

1107
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,070
它已经快要一文不值了
it's not gonna be worth very much.
