1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,350
《訴訟雙雄》前情提要

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,910
我認識的人中從來沒有
I don't know anyone that has ever made

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,470
異地戀最后有結果的
a long-distance relationship work.

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,900
我沒法忍受自己讓你陷入這種境地
But I can't stand that I put you in this position,

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,480
我能想到的唯一辦法就是
and the only way I can see out of this

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,960
你去斯坦福讀書
is for you to go to Stanford.

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,400
你朝我開火就好  坦納
Come after me, Tanner.

8
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,740
這才是你今天來這里的目的
That's what you're here for.

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,350
你是真的在乎她的
You actually care about her.

10
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,970
你覺得他在里面
You think he didn't say some things in there

11
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,340
沒說什么傷我的話嗎
that got to me too?

12
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,180
但我卻沒把它們當回事  因為如今
Well, I'm not bringing them up, because right now,

13
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,480
我們得團結作戰
we need to stick together.

14
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,340
團結作戰的意思是得相互坦誠
Sticking together means telling the truth.

15
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,470
我不能忍受他們不斷找你麻煩
I can't stand to see them come after you.

16
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,800
你認為我承受不了嗎
You think I can't take it!

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,500
你沒明白我的意思
Look, you're not listening to me, okay?

18
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,760
是我承受不了
I can't take it!

19
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,870
如果你只是想跟我一起工作
If all you want to do is work with me,

20
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,710
我可以在別的地方找工作
I can find a job somewhere else.

21
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,340
斯科特  我想要的不止這些
Scottie, that's not all I want.

22
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,740
那就說出來
Then say it.

23
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,320
我希望我的生命中有你
I want you in my life.

24
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,800
我不想讓她走
I don't want her to go,

25
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,520
但現在我也無能為力
and there's nothing I can do about it.

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,730
我比較完了
I finished my list.

27
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,770
結果呢
And?

28
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,600
你要留下來
You're staying?

29
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,860
有本事就攔住我
Just try and stop me.

30
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,920
這里有哈佛法學院歷屆學生的檔案
This place has every Harvard law student file ever.

31
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,250
不準碰這里的任何檔案
Do not touch any of the files in here.

32
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,130
邁克·羅斯  他不在這兒
Mike Ross? He's not here.

33
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,440
想什么呢
What are you thinking about?

34
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,530
你真美
You look beautiful.

35
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,160
謝謝
Thank you.

36
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,960
你想什么呢
What are you thinking?

37
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,350
你的家具都好老
That your furniture's really old.

38
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,970
你是想說"古經典"吧
I think the word you're looking for is "antiquey."

39
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:23,710
那根本不是個詞
That is not a word,

40
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,520
這個沙發是宜家1994年左右的產品
and this sofa is Ikea circa 1994.

41
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,110
好吧  知道了
Okay, I get it.

42
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,610
你這么早起床  就是為了狠狠地
So you get up early just so you can do a thorough critiquing

43
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,860
挖苦我的家具
of my furniture?

44
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,460
其實  我這么早起床  是為了考慮
Actually, I got up early, so I could figure out

45
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,920
這里有沒有哪樣家具我能接著用
if there's anything around here that I could stand living with.

46
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,150
你是說...要搬過來一起住嗎
As--I'm sorry--do you want to move in together?

47
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,570
如果你還邀請我的話
Yeah, I mean, if the offer still stands.

48
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,300
開玩笑嗎
Are you kidding me?

49
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,580
這么說你同意了嗎
So is that a yes?

50
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,420
這才是同意了
Oh, no, this is a yes.

51
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,310
我知道我們要帶上什么了
I figured out what we can bring.

52
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,780
-什么  -你
- What? - You.

53
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,690
這個熊貓
Panda, right here.

54
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,300
這是我最喜歡的藝術品
That's my favorite piece of art.

55
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,670
那根本不是藝術
That is not art.

56
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,840
是奶奶給我的
Grammy gave that to me.

57
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,230
我喜歡  熊貓可以有
Oh, I love it. Panda can come.

58
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,550
還有這把椅子
And the chair.

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,130
那是奶奶最喜歡的椅子
That was grammy's favorite chair.

60
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,910
這我...
I don't--I don't--

61
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,710
不不不  我告訴你瑞秋
No, no, no, no, no, I'm telling you, Rachel,

62
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,760
以前她每周日都坐在椅子里
she used to sit in that chair every Sunday

63
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,640
喝她的好時熱可可
and drink her hot cup of Hershey's cocoa

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,290
跟我講述她小時候
and tell me all about growing up

65
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,940
在費城壞街區的事
on the mean streets of Philadelphia.

66
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,550
撒謊的時候  別說得那么詳細
When you lie, try less details.

67
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,790
明白
Got it.

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,310
找我呢
Looking for me?

69
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,050
不是
No.

70
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,440
我要找的女人應該還在我床上呢
The woman I'm looking for is a lot more in my bed.

71
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,780
沒辦法  我的日程不等人啊
What can I say? My schedule stops for no man.

72
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,060
是啊  但我們還有沒做完的
Yes, but we've got a little unfinished...

73
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,160
事呢
business.

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,620
我覺得昨晚不差什么了
I wouldn't call last night "unfinished."

75
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,680
也不算是"公事"
And I wouldn't call it "business."

76
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,650
我指的是早餐
I was talking about breakfast.

77
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,520
哈維·斯佩克特還做早餐
Harvey Specter makes breakfast?

78
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,190
沒聽說過斯佩克特特色餐嗎
You never heard of the Specter special?

79
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,840
我好像剛剛嘗過了
I think I just had the Specter special.

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,970
不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

81
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,910
-斯佩克特特色餐是  -我猜猜
- The Specter special is - Let me guess.

82
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,290
兩個雞蛋  煎兩面
It's two eggs, over easy,

83
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,330
配菜是  "斯科特
with a side of "Scottie,

84
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,320
我希望我的生命中有你"
I want you in my life."

85
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,510
熏肉
Bacon.

86
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,060
我要重新考慮一下進入我生命中的事了
And now I'm reconsidering the "in my life" thing.

87
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,910
休想  我看到你的表情了  你是認真的
Oh, no, I saw your face. You had your serious face on.

88
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,760
斯科特  我希望我的生命中有你
"Scottie, I want you in my life.

89
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,770
斯科特  我希望我的生命中有你
Scottie... I want you in my life."

90
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,440
跟你說  不給你做熏肉了
You know what? You don't deserve my bacon.

91
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,400
無所謂  反正我得走了
Oh, that's fine, 'cause I have to go anyway.

92
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,540
你能去哪啊  你丟了工作
Where could you have to go? You're unemployed.

93
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,730
其實  昨晚有家一流的律所提出雇傭我
Well, actually a top-tier law firm offered me a job last night,

94
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,500
我覺得我應該去跟
and I thought it might be best

95
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,660
我沒在跟她上床的那位合伙人
if I negotiate the terms of my agreement

96
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,880
討論合約的條款
with the partner I'm not sleeping with.

97
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,060
這個計劃有個小問題
There's a slight problem with that plan.

98
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,480
你沒跟我商量就提出要給她一份工作
You offered her a job before talking to me?

99
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,630
我沒有  我只是問她是不是想要工作
I didn't offer her a job. I asked her if she wanted one.

100
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,090
我不想浪費你的時間  而且
I didn't want to waste your time, and for the record,

101
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,230
我們有她加入肯定是好事
we'd be lucky to have her.

102
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,070
這我知道
I know that.

103
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,400
但我的問題不是為什么想要她加入
But my question isn't why I should want her here,

104
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,320
而是你為什么想要她加入
it's why you would want her here.

105
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,690
她是我認識的最好的律師  僅次于我
She's the best lawyer I know, after me.

106
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,010
還有你
And you.

107
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,500
你在跟她上床嗎
Are you sleeping with her?

108
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,430
什么
Excuse me?

109
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,530
你跟她有段歷史
You have history with this woman,

110
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,530
我只是想知道
So I just want to know

111
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,470
你這么做是出于同情
are you doing this because you feel sorry for her

112
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,670
還是想回報她
or because you want to pay her back

113
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,100
還是因為你愛她
or because you love her or what?

114
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,340
-不關你的事  -就關我的事
- It's none of your business. - It is my business.

115
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,830
這就是我的公司
It is literally my business.

116
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,370
我想跟她好好發展
I want a relationship with her.

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,940
我替你高興
Well, I'm happy for you.

118
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,460
-希望你們能成功  -謝謝
- I hope you two make a run at it. - Thanks.

119
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,790
我就當做你是真心的
I'll pretend you meant that.

120
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,300
你的記錄不怎么樣
Your track record isn't great.

121
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,470
你兩年換了三個合伙人
You've had three name partners in two years.

122
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,010
有承諾問題的是你吧
Let's talk about your commitment issues.

123
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,520
但我沒讓你給我承諾問題一間拐角辦公室
I'm not asking you to give my commitment issues a corner office.

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,950
你不用給她拐角辦公室
You don't need to give her a corner office.

125
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,350
正常的辦公室就行
Any regular office will do.

126
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,460
哈維  我懂
Harvey, I get it.

127
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,500
她對你  對這家律師  都不可多得
She's a catch, for you and for this firm.

128
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,460
但如果你們分手了會怎么樣
But what happens when you two break up?

129
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,280
誰說我們會分手
Who says we're gonna break up?

130

第三季   第十一集

138
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,270
福爾曼和心臟醫療的案子  我想要
Foreman versus Heart Med-- I want it.

139
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,010
你不是該說"早啊  哈維"
"Good morning, Harvey.

140
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,360
-"有什么吩咐嗎"  -我是認真的
- What can I do for you today?" - I'm serious.

141
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,220
他們想促成和解
They're pushing for a settlement

142
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,550
因為他們知道我們的客戶付得起和解金
because they know our client can afford it.

143
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,850
我知道
I know they are.

144
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,050
你文件都沒看過怎么知道
You haven't even looked at the file.

145
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,160
律所大門上掛著我的名字呢
My name is on the door.

146
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,430
你以為我不知道我們有什么案子嗎
You think I don't know our cases?

147
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,520
那為什么要同意和解
So why are we settling?

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,300
因為雖然這個案子我們有利可圖
Because regardless of the merits of this case,

149
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,650
但是不值得我們去花那個時間
it's not worth our time.

150
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,390
哈維  聽我說
Harvey, listen--

151
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,700
心臟醫藥自己的律師來促成和解
Heart Med's in-house lawyer negotiated this

152
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,580
是因為公關做不好的代價不止是付和解金
because the bad PR costs them more than the settlement.

153
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,400
我們要讓對方撤訴才真的物有所值
We'd have to get the thing dismissed to make it worth it,

154
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,340
但是這是不可能的
and that's not gonna happen.

155
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,090
對方律師是尼克·里納爾迪
The lawyer is Nick Rinaldi.

156
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,960
-尼克·里納爾迪是誰  -你不記得了嗎
- Who the hell is Nick Rinaldi? - You don't remember?

157
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,760
我當時還是個11歲的小孩子  孤獨無助
I was 11 years old, a little boy, powerless.

158
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,000
眼睜睜地看著他把我父母的生命定為幾個美元
I watched him boil my parents' lives down to a few dollars.

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,550
好
Yes.

160
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,640
我不會再讓那個混蛋從我們這里拿走一分錢了
I'm not gonna let that piece of shit get a penny from us.

161
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,000
我答應你了
I said yes.

162
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,540
謝謝  哈維
Thanks, Harvey.

163
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,440
你想謝我的話
You want to thank me,

164
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,680
就去好好給那個家伙點顏色看看吧
why don't you go beat the shit out of this guy?

165
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,900
星期一  下午兩點二十分
Monday, 2:20 p.m.

166
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,780
這件事我一直想不明白
This conundrum is burning a hole in my brain.

167
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,060
再想想
Think.

168
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,440
邏輯地去想
Logically.

169
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,220
希拉做事專業  一絲不茍
I mean, Sheila is professional and meticulous

170
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,830
而且床技驚人
and wonderfully anal,

171
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,590
如果她說她的秘密小屋里
and if she says that nothing gets misplaced

172
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,010
一切準確的話  那我相信她
in her inner sanctum, then I believe her,

173
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,510
也就是說只能是國家安全行動了
which leaves the national security option.

174
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,700
難道邁克·羅斯是中情局的
Is Mike Ross CIA?

175
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,720
別逗了
Please.

176
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,720
那還不如說埃斯特是克格勃更靠譜
There's a better chance that Esther's in the KGB.

177
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,780
我可以直接去問希拉
I mean, I can ask Sheila,

178
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,730
如果我不想好好對待自己的蛋蛋了的話...
if I'm no longer fond of my testicles, which--

179
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,250
等等  消失的蛋蛋  消失的文件
Wait a second, missing testicles, missing file.

180
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,600
如果本來就不存在就談不上消失了
It can't be missing if it doesn't exist.

181
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,000
蒼天吶
Holy shit.

182
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,710
要是邁克·羅斯根本沒念過哈佛呢
What if Mike Ross never went to Harvard at all?

183
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,940
要是他只上過一個三流法學院呢
What if he just went to some crappy third-tier law school,

184
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,380
比如福特漢姆或者亞利桑那州立法學院
like Fordham or Arizona State?

185
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,740
你好  老兄
"Yeah, hey, bro.

186
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,140
不  派對上見吧
"Yeah, no, I'll see you at the party.

187
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,490
我不去復習司法考試了
"I'm not going to study for the bar.

188
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,370
說得對  還是兄弟靠得住
"Damn straight, that's right, bros before hos.

189
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,420
誰說不是呢  行了  夠了
Oh, yeah, you know--" All right, that's enough.

190
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,950
他這是一顆老鼠屎壞了我們一鍋粥啊
He's been peeing directly into our pristine pool of eliteness.

191
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,840
他真是...  糟了  快沒電了
He's been--oh, shoot, it's blinking out.

192
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,990
諾瑪  我馬上就說完了
Norma, really quickly,

193
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,110
你一定要再堅持一會兒...
I need you to get a pack of rechargeable --

194
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,950
該死  沒電了
Shit, it's out.

195
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,890
那我只是在自言自語罷了
So I guess I'm just talking to myself.

196
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,310
哈維說服我了  我們談談吧
Harvey convinced me, so let's get to it.

197
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,290
-我想要安置費  -沒問題
- I want a relocation fee. - Done.

198
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,390
還要10%的簽約獎金
And a 10% increase on my signing bonus.

199
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,480
7%
7%.

200
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,340
你給了哈維10%啊
You gave Harvey 10%.

201
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,140
你覺得你跟哈維一樣值錢嗎
Do you think you're worth as much as Harvey?

202
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,250
我沒他那么討人厭
I'm less of a pain in the ass.

203
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,060
那就10%
10% it is.

204
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,010
沒人一開口就這么高價碼的
Now, no one ever opens with the big stuff,

205
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,230
所以你告訴我你真正的目的吧
so why don't you tell me what you're really after?

206
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,060
你明知故問
You know what I'm after.

207
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,730
這家律所的名字是皮爾遜-斯佩克特
The name of the firm is Pearson Specter.

208
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,590
雖然以前改過很多次  但是不會再改了
It's changed too many times, and it's not going to change again.

209
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,660
永遠都不會嗎
Never?

210
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,200
我從來不說永遠
I never say never.

211
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,940
-正合我意  -當然了
- That's all I'm looking for. - Of course.

212
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,070
畢竟誰也說不準幾年后會是什么樣子
After all, who knows where any of us will be in a few years?

213
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,150
你  我  哈維
You, me, Harvey.

214
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,700
我們剛才是不是轉移話題了
I think we just changed the subject.

215
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,470
確實如此
We did.

216
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,870
現在我就告訴你我真正的目的
Now it's time for me to tell you what I'm really after.

217
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,930
你想知道我對哈維有多忠心
You want to know how committed I am to Harvey.

218
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,130
我想知道你對我有多忠心
I want to know how committed you are to me.

219
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,780
-你有多認真  -認真什么
- How serious are you? - About what?

220
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,860
我
Me.

221
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,420
我們不是說過了嗎
We had this conversation.

222
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,470
我們開始說的時候
We had this conversation

223
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,430
我還不用花費五十萬美金呢
before it was going to cost me $500,000.

224
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,010
杰西卡讓你提前支付入股款嗎
Jessica's making you pay the buy-in up front?

225
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,990
-對  -該死
- Yep. - Shit.

226
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,000
那你怎么說的
What did you say?

227
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,270
我說我不想交
Well, I said I don't want to have to pay

228
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,960
哈維·斯佩克特女友附加稅
a Harvey-Specter-girlfriend tax.

229
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,440
這可不是稅
You're not exactly paying a tax.

230
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,750
你只是提前入股而已
You're just buying in early.

231
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,680
哈維  公司設有六個月試用期
Harvey, there's a reason that firms are designed to have

232
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,120
是有原因的
a six-month trial period.

233
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,400
是為了看你是否適合這個公司
Yeah, to see if it's going to work out.

234
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,100
-沒錯  -你認為不適合
- Exactly. - Which you don't think it will.

235
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,440
我的意思是我得知道
I'm saying that I need to know

236
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,040
"我希望我的生命中有你"到底意味著什么
what "I want you in my life" really means.

237
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,760
你心知肚明
You know what it means.

238
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,130
意味著我想跟你在一起
It means I want to have a relationship.

239
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,100
但我還沒準備好向你求婚
But it doesn't mean that I'm ready to give you a ring.

240
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,830
你以為我準備好跟你結婚了嗎
You think I'm ready for a ring from you?

241
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,290
那你都準備什么了
Then what are you ready for?

242
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,070
我準備好了要是不行的話
I'm ready for it not to cost me a $1/2 million

243
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,090
不用花我五十萬的方法
if it doesn't work out.

244
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,020
你是說要是不行  你就會離開嗎
So if it doesn't, are you saying you're going to leave?

245
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,130
你希望我留下嗎
Would you want me to stay?

246
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,550
我都想象不到你怎么能跟我分手
I don't even know what you're gonna do to break us up.

247
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,540
哈維  我是認真的  我...
Harvey, I'm not kidding. I'm...

248
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,400
我害怕
I'm scared.

249
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,840
芝加哥瑞生律師事務所
You know, I just got an offer

250
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,880
剛剛向我提出了邀請
from Latham & Watkins in Chicago,

251
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,790
我不想去  但...
And I don't want to take it, but...

252
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,230
我得知道你是認真的
I need to know that you're serious about this.

253
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,050
斯科特  我是認真的
Scottie, I am.

254
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,640
說得容易  又沒人讓你拿五十萬美元
Yeah, but nobody's asking you to put up $1/2 million.

255
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,910
或許我們可以做到
Maybe we can make it

256
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,280
讓你不用掏錢
so nobody's asking you to do that either.

257
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,020
里納爾迪
Rinaldi.

258
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,780
還記得我嗎
You remember me?

259
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,150
詹姆斯·羅斯和妮娜·羅斯
James and Nina Ross.

260
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,510
不錯
That's good.

261
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,190
你終于知道我父母的名字了
Finally know my parents' names.

262
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,740
但你可能不知道  我是個律師了
What you maybe don't know is that I'm a lawyer,

263
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,250
在皮爾遜-斯佩克特工作
I work for Pearson Specter,

264
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,020
福爾曼案我們不會和解
and we're not going to be settling this Foreman suit.

265
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,410
我們已經談好了
We had an agreement.

266
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,670
或許吧  但是
Yeah, maybe, but instead,

267
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,390
我們要填這個了
we're gonna be filing this.

268
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,460
案子不可能被撤銷
There's no way you're getting this case dismissed.

269
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,630
我真希望相信那個關于改革重組的
You know, I actually wanted to believe that whole sob story

270
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,840
煽情故事  但是...
about being reformed, but--

271
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,270
我的客戶是個寡婦  不是醉酒的司機
my client is a widow, not a drunk driver.

272
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,030
所以你就不再嚇唬那個人
Oh, so you don't actually bully the little guy anymore,

273
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,390
打算利用他了
you just try and capitalize on him.

274
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,960
你到底知不知道案子的細節
Do you even know the details of this case,

275
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,780
還是因為我是對方的律師就咬著不放
or are you just coming after us because I'm on the other side?

276
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,610
不  我跟你糾纏
No, I'm coming after you

277
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,450
是因為你是個無能的事故賠償律師
because you're a worthless ambulance chaser,

278
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,560
我不會讓你拿走我客戶的一分錢
and I'm not gonna let you take my client's money.

279
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,470
這已經是第二次你對我
This is the second time you've come after me

280
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,050
搞突然襲擊了
from out of the blue.

281
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,480
上次我道過歉了
I apologized to you once.

282
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,340
這次我不會再道歉了
I will not apologize to you again.

283
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,630
你不用道歉
You don't have to.

284
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,230
不會有庭審的
And we're not going to court,

285
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,470
因為我會證明你是個滿嘴胡話的瘋子
because I'm gonna prove you're full of shit.

286
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,180
準備好取證了嗎
You ready for the deposition?

287
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,610
當然準備好了
Yeah, of course I'm ready.

288
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,760
-你褲鏈沒拉  -瞎說
- Your fly is unzipped. - No, it's not.

289
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,580
你都沒猶豫
Didn't even flinch.

290
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,300
說明你準備好了
That means you're ready.

291
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,920
那你還跟著我干什么
Then why are you still walking with me?

292
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,210
因為我也參加取證
Cause I'm coming to your deposition.

293
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,590
什么  等等  等一下
What? Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

294
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,010
你說過這案子歸我負責
You said that I could take this case.

295
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,640
你說我會打得對方落花流水
You told me I could kick this guy's ass.

296
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,240
這是我的取證  不是你的
It's my deposition, not yours.

297
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,860
-我知道  -你知道
- I know. - you know?

298
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,040
-那你為什么看著我  -我沒看著你
- Why are you babysitting me? - I'm not babysitting you.

299
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,280
我想親眼看你手刃他
I want to watch you kill this guy.

300
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,100
所以才準備了零食
That's why I brought snacks.

301
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,430
你可不能把花生帶進取證現場
You can't bring peanuts into my deposition.

302
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,040
-為什么  -太不專業了
- Why? - It's unprofessional.

303
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,640
你那領帶也是  可我都沒計較
So is that tie, but I've made my peace with it.

304
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,340
我才不管你
Look, I don't give a shit

305
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,910
計較什么
whether you made your peace with it or not.

306
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,950
你想參加取證
You want in my room?

307
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,690
就不許帶花生
You're not bringing peanuts.

308
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,950
真是準備好了啊
You really are ready.

309
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,740
接著
Here.

310
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,740
什么東西
What's this?

311
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,640
邁克·羅斯被錄取那天哈維的面試名單
Harvey's interviews the day Mike Ross was hired.

312
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,890
但邁克·羅斯不在上面
But Mike Ross isn't on it.

313
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,060
你在哪拿到的
Where'd you get this?

314
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,040
那不重要  反正已經拿到了
Doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is I did.

315
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,630
你是想問為什么邁克·羅斯不在上面嗎
Are you asking me why Mike Ross isn't on it?

316
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,720
是的  唐娜  我就想問這個
Yeah, Donna, that's precisely what I'm asking.

317
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,800
哈維是怎么找到他的
How exactly did Harvey find him?

318
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,660
不是我們找到了他  是他找到了我們
We didn't find him, he found us.

319
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,210
什么意思
What are you talking about?

320
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,310
邁克沒有及時報名面試
Mike hadn't signed up for the interview on time,

321
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,520
所以他假裝成名單上的律師
so he pretended to be one of the other associates on the list.

322
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,680
他說服了我
He talked his way past me

323
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,150
還給哈維留下深刻印象
and impressed the shit out of Harvey,

324
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,640
哈維就想招一個
whose main requirement was somebody who had the balls

325
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,930
有膽量這么做的人
to do something like that in the first place.

326
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,130
好吧
Okay.

327
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,780
如果他有膽量做些
What if he had the balls to do something

328
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,330
比這嚴重的多的事呢
a lot bigger than that?

329
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,280
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

330
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,010
我認為邁克·羅斯上的是一所很差的法學院
I think Mike Ross went to a subpar law school

331
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,440
而且一直在用謊言掩蓋這個事實
and has been lying about it the whole time.

332
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,420
路易  聽聽你自己說的話
Louis, listen to yourself.

333
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,410
你說的可是邁克
You're talking about Mike.

334
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,660
你簡直瘋了
You're insane.

335
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,760
我
I'm--

336
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,300
好吧  我曾和希拉去過哈佛檔案室
Okay, I was in the Harvard file room with Sheila.

337
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,200
別問我細節
Don't ask details.

338
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,680
我發現那里沒有邁克·羅斯的檔案
And I noticed Mike Ross' file was not there.

339
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,980
你還專門去找了他的檔案
You specifically looked for his file?

340
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,640
是的  我也找了哈維的
Yes, and I looked for Harvey's too,

341
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,870
他的就有
and his was there.

342
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,800
順便說一句  他過去看上去像個蠢貨
And by the way, he looked like a major douche.

343
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,570
所以你在數以萬計的檔案里面
So you looked at a grand total of two files

344
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,830
尋找兩個檔案
out of tens of thousands,

345
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,530
然后就得出了這個結論
and this is the conclusion you jump to?

346
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,280
你到底出了什么問題
What is wrong with you?

347
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,260
你不了解希拉
You don't know Sheila.

348
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,220
她就像個外科醫生  這些檔案就是病人
She's like a surgeon, and the files are her patients.

349
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,980
她不會犯錯誤
She doesn't make mistakes.

350
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,140
-那你跟她講過這件事嗎  -當然沒有
- You told her about this? - Hell no.

351
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,040
她讓我不要碰任何檔案
She told me not to touch any of those files,

352
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,530
如果被她發現  她會殺了我
and she'd kill me if she found out that I did.

353
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,920
我只是泛泛的問了一下
I just asked her about it generally.

354
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,010
她當然會說自己從來沒丟過檔案
Well, of course she's gonna say she never loses one,

355
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,170
但就我的個人經驗來說
but I can tell you from personal experience,

356
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,240
任何事情都有可能發生
anything can happen to a file.

357
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,080
-我不知道  -我知道
- I don't know.- Well, I do.

358
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,300
我了解邁克  我知道他的本事
I know Mike, and I know he's for real.

359
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,620
但如果你還是懷疑  有個很簡單的方法
But if you still doubt it, there's an easy answer.

360
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,620
給哈佛打電話要一份他的成績單復印件
Just call up Harvard and ask for a copy of his transcript.

361
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,480
如果這東西不存在呢
And what if it's not there?

362
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,800
那我會就像你道歉  叫你瘋子的事
Then I will apologize for calling you insane

363
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,040
并且親自幫助你把邁克·羅斯趕出大廈
and personally help you escort Mike Ross out of the building.

364
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,430
再見
Good-bye.

365
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,660
2002年  你因為一個舊款心臟支架
In 2002, you were sued for the malfunctioning

366
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,260
失效而被起訴
of an earlier model of the heart stent.

367
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,870
對嗎
Is that correct?

368
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,110
是的  并且我們承認了過失
Yes, and we admitted wrongdoing.

369
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,960
安裝在你病人體內的支架是一個
The stent that was installed in your patient was a new model

370
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,330
經過三年大量實驗研發出的新型號
developed through three years of extensive trials.

371
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,670
因此不在討論范圍內  而且實話實說
Making it outside the scope, and frankly, not a good argument

372
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,030
那也并不是一個建立模式的好論點
for establishing pattern.

373
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,240
他們發現了問題  并解決了它
They saw a problem, and they fixed it.

374
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,870
太糟了  我們應該起訴他們啊
How horrible, we should sue them.

375
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,060
我們現在并沒有在法庭上
We're not in court.

376
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,580
開庭陳述是要說給法官聽的
Opening statements are made before a judge,

377
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,220
還是你根本就沒上過庭
or have you never been in court before?

378
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,500
我就是想讓你先體會一下
I just wanted to give you a taste,

379
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,510
因為也許我們根本上不到法庭
seeing as we're never actually gonna get there.

380
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,390
這個案子不可能被駁回  孩子
A dismissal is never gonna happen, son.

381
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,500
我很抱歉  孩子
Sorry for your loss, son.

382
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,020
什么
What?

383
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,030
我是說不要期待這個案子被駁回
I'm saying, don't hope for a dismissal.

384
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,890
請對我們的客戶直接提出你的問題
Please direct your questions to our client.

385
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,940
我所說的不是問題  只是觀點
That wasn't a question. It was a comment.

386
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,920
確實有個問題  戴蒙德先生
Here's a question for you, Mr. Dimond.

387
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,690
這個案子對你來講到底意味著什么
What is this really worth to you?

388
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,380
你也許認為你能贏
You may think you have a defense.

389
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,470
但你的律師似乎認為你一定贏
Your lawyer certainly thinks you do.

390
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,550
但我只想跟你表明一下事實
But I just want to be clear about the facts.

391
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,530
這個案子對你來講到底意味著什么
What is this really worth to you?

392
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,030
毫無疑問  這是個可怕的意外
There's no question, this was a terrible accident.

393
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,890
但跟你表明一下事實
But let's be clear about the facts.

394
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,440
他的血液酒精含量是個問題
His blood alcohol level is an issue here.

395
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,440
如果你堅持上庭
If you pursue this in court,

396
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,480
你可能什么都得不到
there's no guarantee you'll receive anything.

397
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,480
為孩子想想
Think about the boy.

398
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,920
想想他需要什么
Think about what he needs.

399
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,460
有總比沒有好
Something is better than nothing.

400
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,480
別愣神了  羅斯先生
Stop stalling, Mr. Ross.

401
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,210
-我  -他不是在愣神
- Um, I-- - He's not stalling.

402
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,980
并且我們沒有義務
And we're under no obligation

403
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,190
公開之前那個型號的實驗信息
to disclose trials from an earlier model.

404
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,580
這不在討論范圍內
It's beyond the scope.

405
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,800
我們的專家會想辦法把它列入到范圍內的
Our expert will place that study within the scope.

406
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,800
如果我們不上庭
If there isn't a trial,

407
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,060
你的專家根本就沒有范圍可以列入
your expert won't have any scope to place it in.

408
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,820
鑒于你堅持要提一些
And since you insist on asking questions

409
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,660
我們沒有義務回答的問題
we're under no obligation to answer,

410
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,140
此次取證結束了
this deposition is over.

411
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,790
剛才出了什么事
What the hell happened in there?

412
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,970
你說你只是看看  不會搶我的案子
You said you wanted to watch, not hijack my case.

413
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,350
你還說你會好好教訓他呢
You said you were going to kick his ass,

414
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,650
而不是夢游仙境
not drift into never-never land.

415
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,630
-我在處理了  -處理
- I'm handling it. - Handling it?

416
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,920
你回答那個問題的間隙
I could've eaten that whole bag of peanuts

417
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,150
我都能吃完整包花生了
in the pause you took to answer that question.

418
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,200
你出局了  而我把你保了下來
You got thrown, and I bailed you out.

419
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,600
哈維  這是我的案子
Harvey, this is my case.

420
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,030
這不是你的案子  是客戶的案子
This is not your case. It's the client's case.

421
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,590
而且經歷了剛才那一幕
And after what happened in there,

422
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
他們的處境比剛開始時更糟了
they're in a worse position than when we started.

423
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,800
我知道剛才被修理了  但我能挽回局面
Look, I know I got thrown, but I can still recover.

424
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,410
也許吧
Maybe,

425
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,760
但是他們一個半小時之內就會打電話過來
but they're gonna call in a half an hour

426
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,840
想要和解了
wanting to take the deal,

427
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,190
到那時  我會幫你拖一天
and when they do, I'm gonna buy you one day,

428
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,980
然后我就結了這個案子
and then I'm pulling the plug.

429
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,050
有空嗎
Hey, do you have a minute?

430
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,140
-我這會兒有點忙  -我們有麻煩了
- I'm a little busy right now. - We have a problem.

431
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,990
斯科特不會惹麻煩的
Scottie's not going to be a problem.

432
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,830
我全面考慮過了
I thought it through--

433
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,390
路易可能發現邁克的事了
Louis might be onto Mike.

434
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,610
他在哈佛的檔案室里
He found out that Mike doesn't have a file

435
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,800
沒找到邁克的檔案
in the Harvard file room

436
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,270
還發現他不在你原先的面試名單上
and that he wasn't on your original interview list.

437
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,450
你和他說了什么
What did you tell him?

438
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,630
我把面試名單那個圓過去了
Well, I handled the list.

439
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,840
-那其他的呢  -我還能怎么說啊
- What about the other? - What could I tell him?

440
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,160
我告訴他假如他真這么好奇的話
I mean, I told him if he was so curious,

441
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,510
他可以索要一份邁克的成績單
he could order a copy of Mike's transcript.

442
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,820
那我們就沒什么麻煩了
Then we don't have a problem.

443
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,730
你不覺得我們該做點別的什么嗎
Well, don't you think maybe we should do something else?

444
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,170
不管做什么都只會讓他更加懷疑
Anything else is just going to make him more suspicious.

445
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,540
-你確定  -是的  我確定
- Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.

446
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,480
好吧
Okay.

447
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,910
等等
Oh, wait a second.

448
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,240
你剛剛說路易去了哪里
Where did you say Louis was again?

449
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,640
他去了哈佛的檔案室
Oh, he was in the Harvard file room.

450
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,930
他怎么能進哈佛的檔案室
How was he in the Harvard file room?

451
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,140
他和希拉·賽斯有一腿
He has a relationship with Sheila Sazs.

452
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,700
什么
What?

453
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,730
是的  別擔心  沒事的
Yeah, never mind. We're good.

454
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,290
謝謝
Oh, thank you,

455
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,420
但是不好意思  我現在沒時間
But I'm sorry, I don't have time.

456
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,400
這是食物  這不會耽誤你什么的
It's food. It's not going to stop you.

457
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,250
反而能讓你堅持下去
It's going to keep you going.

458
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,960
是的  但我不需要食物
Yeah, I don't need food.

459
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,950
我需要的是找到一些能讓我帶去
I need to find something I can take

460
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,980
明天的撤訴聽證上的東西
to this dismissal hearing tomorrow.

461
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,880
邁克  這和解開出的條件挺不錯的
Mike, it was a pretty decent settlement.

462
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,480
接受這個和解真有這么糟糕嗎
Would it really be so bad to just take it?

463
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,280
我爸就是個什么事
My dad was one of those guys

464
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,830
都喜歡慶祝的人
who liked to celebrate everything--

465
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,060
半歲生日  或是我第一次
the half birthdays or first time

466
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,840
在棒球小聯盟里把某個人三振出局
I struck someone out at little league.

467
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,130
我最后一次見他們時
And the last time I saw them,

468
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,390
他們在過他們的第一次約會紀念日
they were celebrating the anniversary of their first date.

469
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,400
他們當時很興奮  全部盛裝打扮了
They were so excited, all dressed up,

470
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,310
而我當時卻很惱火
and I was annoyed,

471
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,170
因為我不想
because I didn't want to

472
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,730
去我奶奶家過夜
spend the night at my grandmother's house.

473
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,750
所以他們出發前
So before they left,

474
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,120
我爸上樓來和我道別
my dad came upstairs to say good-bye,

475
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,630
我對他說  慶祝第一次約會真是傻死了
and I told him that celebrating a first date was stupid.

476
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,200
然后他就這樣看著我  好像對我說
And he just looks at me like,

477
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,740
"邁克  你完全不了解
"Michael, you have no idea

478
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,780
第一次約會有多重要"
how important a first date can be."

479
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,320
他們的第一次約會一定很棒
Theirs must have been a great one.

480
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,490
不不不  完全是一場災難
No, no, no, it was a total disaster.

481
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,910
他把酒撒了她一身  還忘帶錢包了
He spilled wine all over her. He forgot his wallet.

482
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,450
然后  不知怎么的  這個女人
And then, for some reason, this woman, you know--

483
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,680
這個他認為是完美的女人
this woman who he knew was just perfect--

484
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,390
同意了第二次約會
agreed to a second date.

485
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,860
然后同意了第三次
And a third.

486
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,900
然后同意了之后的一切
And everything after that.

487
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,230
我真希望我見過他們
I wish I could have met them.

488
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,960
他試著和我擁抱告別
He tried to hug me good-bye...

489
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,640
但我沒有抱他
but I didn't hug him back.

490
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,990
我甚至都沒下樓和我媽說再見
I didn't even go downstairs to say good-bye to my mom.

491
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,740
然后他們就去了
And then they were gone.

492
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,140
第二天早晨  里納爾迪出現在我們家
And then the next morning, Rinaldi shows up at our house,

493
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,310
他提供給我奶奶
and he offers my grandmother

494
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,760
相當于一年租金那么多的錢
the equivalent of one year's rent.

495
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,120
雖然里納爾迪沒有殺害我的父母
Rinaldi didn't kill my parents,

496
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,490
但他確實試圖告訴我我父母的命值多少錢
but he did try to tell me what their lives were worth.

497
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,350
但很抱歉  我知道我父母的命
And I'm sorry, but I know that my mom and dad were worth...

498
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,670
比那個數字多得多
a lot more than that.

499
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,070
別管那些食物了
Forget the food.

500
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,820
分一半文件給我
Give me half the files.

501
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,940
找個對沖基金的人怎樣  他們錢多
What about a hedge fund guy? It's big money.

502
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,100
野心再大一點
Think bigger.

503
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,070
奧巴馬
Obama.

504
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,350
我才不要撈個總統
I'm not going to land the president

505
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,560
來做我的第一個客戶呢
as my first client.

506
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,580
好吧  假如你覺得自己不行的話
Fine, if you don't think you can.

507
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,600
你無法操縱我去把奧巴馬撈來做客戶的
You're not going to manipulate me into trying to land Obama.

508
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,290
最好找個這樣的
Well, it better be somebody like that,

509
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,270
不然杰西卡不會放棄提前入股款的
or Jessica won't give up on her early buy-in bullshit.

510
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,060
我要是給自己找個搞體育的人呢
What if I got myself a sports guy?

511
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,980
事實上你稱呼人家為"搞體育的"
The very fact that you call it "a sports guy"

512
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,230
就說明這行不通了
means it's a no.

513
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,810
哈維  我不懂體育
Harvey, just because I don't know sports

514
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,420
不代表我不懂你
doesn't mean I don't know you.

515
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,630
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

516
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,030
假如我要改變杰西卡的想法
If I'm going to change Jessica's mind,

517
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,950
僅僅拉個客戶是不夠的
I can't just land someone,

518
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,810
我得拉到個你拉不到的人才行
I have to land someone you couldn't.

519
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,080
沒有我拉不到的人
There's no one I couldn't land.

520
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,970
你以為我不知道北京發生的事嗎
You think I don't know about Beijing?

521
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,310
那是他的一家之言
That's his word against mine.

522
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,350
我猜我們現在就能搞清楚
I guess we can clear that up right now,

523
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,230
因為你看看  剛剛走進來的是誰
because look who just walked in.

524
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,250
你早知道他今晚會來
You knew he was coming here tonight?

525
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,180
你以為我喜歡阿根廷食物嗎
You think I like Argentinean food?

526
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,930
我只是要你拖住他一會兒
I just need you to stop him for a second.

527
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,960
懂了
I get it.

528
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,460
你從《上班女郎》那兒得來的主意
You got the idea from Working Girl,

529
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,040
他們毀了婚禮  以得到特斯克電臺
when they crash the wedding to get to Trask radio.

530
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,570
哈維  我不是什么小女孩
Harvey, I'm not a 14-year-old girl.

531
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,310
不需要從電影里學什么主意
I don't get my ideas from movies.

532
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,830
邁克爾
Michael.

533
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,150
邁克爾·菲爾普斯

534
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,350
╰→

535
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,460
哈維
Harvey.

536
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,420
我不想跟你說話
I have no interest in talking to you.

537
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,150
╰→

538
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,230
你好  我是達娜·斯科特
Hi. Dana Scott.

539
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,160
我和哈維共事  我不怪你
I work with Harvey, and I don't blame you.

540
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,760
我也不會愿意讓他代表我
I wouldn't want him to represent me either.

541
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,690
但公司的律師不止他一個
But he's not the only lawyer there.

542
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,480
我來猜猜
Let me guess.

543
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,020
你已經調查過我的記錄了
You've done your research on my record,

544
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,720
現在是想給我留下好印象
and you're here to impress me.

545
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,310
別的律師都會這么做的
That's what every other lawyer would do.

546
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,440
-我就沒有  -哈維  閉嘴
- I didn't do that. - Harvey, shut up.

547
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,640
我才不管你能游多快呢
I don't give a shit about how fast you used to swim.

548
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,150
我只在乎我幫你賺錢的速度有多塊
I only care about how fast I can make you money.

549
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,960
能有多快
How fast is that?

550
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,600
不如先坐下來  我再告訴你
Why don't you sit down, and I'll tell you?

551
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,360
-行  -好
- All right. - Okay.

552
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,480
哈維  不介意吧
Harvey, you mind?

553
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,730
-其實我...  -好極了
- Actually, I-- - Great.

554
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,000
明天見
I'll see you tomorrow.

555
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,260
見到你很高興  伙計
Good to see you, buddy.

556
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,330
北京那邊到底怎么回事
So what really happened in Beijing?

557
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,670
先喝一杯再說
Let's get a drink first.

558
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,280
好主意
Sounds good.

559
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,090
醫生  這程序有多常規
Doctor, how routine is this procedure?

560
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,340
西德·福爾曼本來在大概一周后
Sid Foreman should have been dancing

561
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,130
就能在女兒婚禮上跳舞了
at his daughter's wedding a week later.

562
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,410
但他心力衰竭了
Instead, he went into heart failure.

563
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,980
隆巴德醫生  2006年12月7日
Dr. Lombard, on december 7, 2006,

564
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,010
是否有病人在常規血管成型手術中
did a patient die on your table

565
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,580
死在手術臺上
during a routine angioplasty?

566
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,520
反對  法官大人  問題相關嗎
Objection, your honor. Relevance?

567
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,340
判斷他作為鑒定人是否合格  法官大人
It speaks to his qualifications as an expert witness, Your Honor.

568
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,600
允許提問
I'll allow.

569
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,350
是  有名病人死了
Yes, a patient died.

570
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,460
是否有人以醫療失誤為由起訴你玩忽職守呢
And was a malpractice suit filed against you for physician error?

571
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,450
那個案件被封存了
That case was sealed.

572
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,450
我沒有問你是否被封存
I didn't ask you if it was sealed.

573
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,920
我問的是  是否提起了訴訟
I asked if it was filed.

574
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,520
是
It was.

575
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,670
-和解了嗎  -幾乎沒什么...
- And settled? - For almost nothing--

576
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,420
反對  法官大人
Objection, your honor.

577
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,170
要求撤消提問  案件已被封存
Move to strike. The case is sealed.

578
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,450
目擊者不能提供
The witness isn't allowed to testify

579
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,900
關于該和解的證詞
to the details of that settlement.

580
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,980
反對有效
Sustained.

581
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,870
你此后進行過醫療工作嗎
Have you practiced medicine since?

582
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,380
對  一直在進行
Yes, I've been practicing.

583
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,460
抱歉  我想問你是否實施過手術
I'm sorry, what I meant to say is have you performed surgery,

584
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,080
為這一技能你訓練了七年
The job you spent seven years training to do?

585
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,820
沒有
No.

586
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,410
怎么  信心不足嗎
What, loss of confidence?

587
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,350
還是他們不讓
They wouldn't let you?

588
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,970
反對  推測行為
Objection. Speculation.

589
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,540
我希望問題得到回答
I want an answer to my question.

590
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,810
我選擇做其他事
I chose to do other things.

591
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,030
其他沒有致死風險的事情嗎
Other things that don't involve the chance of you killing people?

592
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,430
-反對  -撤回
- Objection! - Withdrawn.

593
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,220
你收入的基本來源是什么
What's your primary source of income?

594
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,680
鑒定人
I work as an expert witness.

595
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,610
你現在以作證維生
so you testify now to make a living,

596
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,770
因為你認為自己做不好
because you don't trust yourself to do the job

597
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,200
本身受訓該做的工作嗎
that you were trained to do?

598
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,800
我可以證實這宗案件的事實
I can speak to the facts of this case--

599
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,840
對  你可以證實
Yes, you can speak to them,

600
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,650
但連你自己都明顯的不信任自己
but how are we supposed to trust your opinion about them

601
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,490
讓我們如何信任你
when you clearly don't trust yourself?

602
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,020
你質疑了我的專家
You raised some doubts about my expert.

603
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,470
那也不會讓這個案子撤銷的
That isn't gonna get this case dismissed.

604
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,890
可能不會  但如果這是你能找到最好的專家
Maybe not, but if that's the best expert you can come up with,

605
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,890
那你的客戶大概能看到這場審訊的結果
then your client just got a taste of how this trial is gonna go.

606
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,970
我的客戶不會撤訴的
My client is not gonna drop this case,

607
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,060
我也不會
and neither am I.

608
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,530
那你是逼我走這步棋了
Well, then you are forcing me to use this.

609
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,250
這是福爾曼先生在女兒婚禮上的照片
It's a picture of Mr. Foreman at his daughter's wedding.

610
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,440
這是福爾曼先生在女兒婚禮上
It's a picture of Mr. Foreman drinking alcohol

611
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,290
喝酒的照片
at his daughter's wedding.

612
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,180
那是祝酒  不過一小口
It's a toast. It was one sip.

613
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,370
他的支架失靈兩小時前的一小口
One sip two hours before his stent supposedly malfunctioned.

614
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,960
他術后嚴禁飲酒
Alcohol was strictly forbidden following his surgery,

615
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,900
所以他的死亡是自身的責任
which makes him liable for his own death.

616
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,010
這完全是扭曲事實
This is a total twisting of the facts.

617
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,420
你證明不了它引起了任何事
You can't prove this caused anything.

618
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,970
你也沒法證明這只是一小口
You can't prove it was only one sip,

619
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,800
其實也無所謂  因為一旦我上交了這張照片
and it doesn't matter, because I submit this,

620
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,530
那就是受害者本身的過失  你的案子就沒了
it's contributory negligence, and your case is gone.

621
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,050
你還說我是怪物嗎
And you say I'm a monster.

622
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,040
那是因為你把你的客戶
Being a monster would be putting your client

623
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,880
讓她親自出庭作證
on the stand and making her testify

624
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,550
她丈夫的死是咎由自取
that her husband's death was his own damn fault.

625
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,460
你好啊  唐娜
Hi, Donna.

626
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,450
你好  路易
Hi, Louis.

627
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,250
我是個有擔當的爺們
I'm nothing if not a big man,

628
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,010
出錯的時候我會低頭認錯
and I am not ashamed to admit when I am wrong.

629
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,160
你拿到邁克的成績單了
You got Mike's transcript.

630
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,820
今早剛送到
Arrived this morning.

631
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,890
快看啊  邁克·羅斯是哈佛畢業的呢
Imagine that, Mike Ross went to Harvard.

632
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,050
-真"不敢相信"啊  -你說得對
- What a shocker. - You were right.

633
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,490
從不該懷疑他
Never should have doubted it.

634
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,440
只是很難相信
You know, it's just hard to imagine a world

635
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,870
希拉竟然也會出錯
in which Sheila made a mistake, though.

636
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,540
起碼這事已經真相大白
Well, it's just good you can put this to bed

637
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,530
你可以消停了
once and for all.

638
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,980
還有個事兒
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

639
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,390
既然希拉這么看重自己的能力
If Sheila's competence is that important to her,

640
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,760
我應該告訴她  看她怎么辦
I need to tell her about this, so she can fix it.

641
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,990
對了  路易
You know what, Louis?

642
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,140
我剛想起來
It occurred to me after we talked

643
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,570
我是唯一有當天哈維面試過的
that I'm the only one who has the list of associates

644
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,400
助理候選人名單的人
that interviewed with Harvey that day.

645
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,540
不是啊
That can't be right,

646
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,510
我從總服務器上下載了一份名單
'Cause I got a copy off the general server.

647
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,000
你拿到名單是靠威脅本杰明
You got a copy by bullying Benjamin

648
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,380
從而非法侵入了我的私人硬盤
into accessing my private files off my hard drive.

649
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,170
-這不像我的作風啊  -路易
- That doesn't sound like me. - Louis.

650
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,410
好吧  是我干的  可是我真的很好奇嘛
Okay, I did it, but that was only 'cause I was concerned.

651
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,100
你好奇就可以隨意侵犯我的隱私嗎
So your concern gives you the right to invade my privacy?

652
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,500
我...啥  就一個文件而已
I...what? No, it was just a file.

653
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,260
好大的膽子
How dare you?

654
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,460
你一副相貌堂堂的樣子
You pretend to be this gallant man.

655
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,960
對天發誓絕不涉足我的私人空間
You make a big show of how you would never cross into my area

656
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,240
除非我允許
without my permission.

657
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,630
我就是相貌堂堂  也沒膽侵犯你
I am gallant, and I would never dare.

658
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,840
你是沒膽當著我的面這么做
You wouldn't dare, because you'd have to do it to my face.

659
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,320
可背后搗鬼的事你可一點都不在乎
But you have no problem breaking my trust behind my back,

660
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,220
我不光是生氣
and that not only pisses me off,

661
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,870
我甚至開始懷疑
but it makes me question...

662
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,690
我到底還要不要和你再說一句話
whether I want to have a relationship with you at all.

663
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,480
非常抱歉  唐娜
I'm so sorry, Donna.

664
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,320
行了  路易  別說了
No, Louis, you know what...

665
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,840
-唐娜  我都道歉了  -我沒法
- No, no, no, Donna, I'm sorry. - No, I can't.

666
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,210
-別別別  -我沒法...
- No, no, no, no. - I can't...I can't even...

667
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,230
-我錯了  我錯了  -先閉嘴
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - No, shh! Don't speak.

668
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,550
我都沒法看你
I cannot even look at you right now.

669
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,150
不過我還是費心提醒你一句
And I don't even know why I'm gonna tell you this,

670
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,910
連我都被你氣成這樣
but if you pissed me off that much,

671
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,810
如果希拉發現你辜負了她的信任
what do you think Sheila's gonna do

672
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,760
她會作何反應呢
when you tell her you violated her trust?

673
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,830
說的有理
You're right.

674
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,020
謝謝你  唐娜
Thank you, Donna,

675
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,180
憋了這么久才發作  以拯救我生命中
for putting your anger on hold long enough to help me salvage

676
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,270
唯一一段不是跟貓咪展開的戀情
the single most important non-feline relationship of my life.

677
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,360
-你又淘氣了  -希拉
- Someone's been a bad boy. - Sheila.

678
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,860
你以為我發現不了嗎
You thought I wouldn't find out?

679
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,090
我希望是
I hoped you wouldn't.

680
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,760
你想要人家的小內內
If you wanted a pair of my underwear,

681
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,840
就直說嘛
you should have just asked.

682
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,380
你說這個啊  希拉
Oh, that, Sheila.

683
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,910
你來這里干嘛啊
God, what are you doing here?

684
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,380
你不高興看到我嗎
Aren't you happy I'm here?

685
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,210
我當然高興
Of course, absolutely.

686
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,600
-你看起來沒那么高興  -我高興過頭了
- You don't seem happy. - I'm overjoyed.

687
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,640
我就是...很驚喜嘛
I'm just, you know...I'm just surprised.

688
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,710
可你緊張得渾身冒汗
But you're all nervous and sweaty.

689
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,420
你知道的  我每次看見你
Come on, you know my sweat ducts get excited

690
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,000
-就激動成這樣  -那好
- when they see you. - Good.

691
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,530
看來你要再過度激動一點了
Because your sweat ducts are going to be working overtime.

692
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,100
什么意思
What?

693
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,350
奇爾頓飯店  305房  今晚等你哦
The Chilton, room 305, tonight.

694
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,350
你不必為了放棄案子
You didn't have to come all the way over here

695
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,710
還特意跑一趟
just to drop the case.

696
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,090
我是來告誡你別做錯事的
I came here to tell you you're doing the wrong thing.

697
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,410
我用不著聽你的是非觀
I don't need a lecture from you on right and wrong.

698
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,130
你之前問  我如何面對自己
You once asked me how I live with myself.

699
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,890
這么多年以來  我曾有個機會
Well, somewhere along the way, I realized I had a choice

700
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,430
讓自己看起來不這么混蛋
not to be on the side that made me feel like shit.

701
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,090
-你現在就這個處境  -我可不是混蛋
- You're on that side now. - Yeah, I don't feel like shit.

702
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,230
因為你覺得你在自盡其責
That's because you're telling yourself you're doing your job.

703
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,780
但實際上  你只是在踐踏某人
And I'm telling you that you're bullying someone

704
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,750
而不是同情他
who deserves your sympathy.

705
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,540
你好意思提"踐踏"
You really want to play the bullying card?

706
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,640
我奶奶失去了唯一的兒子
My grandmother lost her only son.

707
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,090
她這么痛苦  你卻利用了她
You used her grief against her.

708
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,760
跟這個無關
This has nothing to do with that.

709
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,260
我理解  你把我看成個惡棍
Look, I know, you need me to be the villain...

710
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,400
不不不
No, no, no, no, no.

711
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,890
你本來就是惡棍
You are the villain.

712
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,570
那么恭喜了  你現在跟我一樣了
Well, then congratulations, because you just became me.

713
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,790
你說什么呢
What are you talking about?

714
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,480
你父親身亡當晚喝了兩杯酒
Your father had two drinks on the night he was killed.

715
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,390
所以我才能讓你祖母達成和解
That was the reason I was able to get your grandmother to settle.

716
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,650
一出電梯就看到大個子
It's not every day I get off the elevator

717
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,160
這可不是每天都能碰到
and find someone in my firm that makes me look short.

718
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,240
看來你見過新客戶了
So you've seen our newest client?

719
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,120
你指斯科特的新客戶
You mean Scottie's newest client.

720
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,550
邁克爾·菲爾普斯或許是她的客戶
Michael Phelps may be her client,

721
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,180
但我們也能拿到速比濤[泳衣廠商]
but we're gonna get Speedo.

722
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,340
我為什么要因此改變主意呢
And why should that make me change my mind?

723
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,860
因為他們給的報酬比讓她的入股費更高
Because their fee is worth more than her buy-in.

724
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,130
你還認為這只是錢的問題
You still think this is about money.

725
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,460
我已經告訴過斯科特  現在我再告訴你
I told this to Scottie, and now I'm going to tell it to you.

726
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,780
我們的人事變動太多了
We've had too much turnover.

727
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,940
不能再變了
We can't have any more.

728
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,060
杰西卡  我告訴你  她入伙了
Jessica, I'm telling you she's in.

729
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,270
那她就更不用擔心
Then she shouldn't have any problem

730
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,920
把錢放入自己公司里了
putting her money where her mouth is.

731
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,180
不是這樣的
It's not right.

732
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,360
哈維  我們該談談這件事了
Harvey, it's time you and I had the talk.

733
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,010
我知道孩子是怎么來的
I know where babies come from.

734
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,440
可你知道情侶間要如何相處嗎
But do you know how couples stay together?

735
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,010
你想說什么
What are you getting at?

736
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,010
丹尼爾和我接管這間律所的時候
When Daniel and I took over the firm,

737
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,400
我們推心置腹地談過了
We had a heart-to-heart.

738
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,100
他有個理念我十分贊同
He had a philosophy that I agreed to live by.

739
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,470
丹尼爾就是坨狗屎
Daniel was a piece of shit.

740
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,200
那不代表他的理念也是
Doesn't mean his philosophy was.

741
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,340
洗耳恭聽
I'm listening.

742
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,980
他告訴我  要維持合伙人關系
He told me, for a partnership to work,

743
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,150
一把手和二把手之間必須有信任
there has to be trust between number one and number two.

744
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,990
你不一定要贊同我
You don't have to agree with me,

745
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,580
但你必須相信  我會聽你的意見
but you have to trust that I listen to you,

746
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,410
我的決定是合理的
that my decisions are reasoned,

747
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,330
以及我會做我認為對的事
and that I am doing what I think is right.

748
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:00,860
杰西卡
Jessica--

749
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,070
公司不能有兩個老大
You can't have two presidents, Harvey.

750
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,750
現在我選擇相信你說的
Now I chose to trust you when you said

751
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,330
你不想成為經營合伙人
you didn't want to be managing partner.

752
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,750
-那是真的嗎  -是
- Was that true or not? - It was.

753
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,670
那你就得接受這個
Then I need you to accept this.

754
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,760
如果我有個主意
What if I had an idea

755
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,140
能讓我們都得償所愿呢
where maybe we can both get what we want?

756
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,930
洗耳恭聽
I'm listening.

757
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,580
我從來沒這樣過
That's never happened to me before.

758
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,590
-沒事的  -不  有事
- It's okay. - No, it isn't.

759
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,530
《黑鷹墜落》
Black Hawk Down.

760
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,960
首先
First of all,

761
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,680
那部電影很棒  你該感到驕傲
that's an amazing movie, and you should be proud

762
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,330
能用它來雙關
that you are associated with it.

763
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,090
其次  我想我知道問題所在
And second of all, I think I know what the problem is.

764
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,020
真的嗎
You do?

765
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,890
是因為檔案室里發生的事
It's about what happened in the file room.

766
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,150
聽著  希拉  我都說不出
Listen, sheila, I can't tell you

767
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,640
那件事有多讓我苦惱
how that's been weighing on my mind.

768
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,420
不  我明白
No, I get it.

769
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,950
現在我們已經正式戀愛了
Now that we've declared our love,

770
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,420
你認為我是個好女孩
you think of me as a good girl.

771
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,350
但你希望我是個壞女孩
And you need me to be bad.

772
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,880
-什么  -這很正常
- What? - It happens all the time.

773
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,510
我們現在確定關系了  你覺得
We're in a relationship now, and you think that changes

774
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,000
這會改變我們性關系的本質
the nature of our sexual relationship.

775
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,070
但我向你保證
But I am here to assure you...

776
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,710
我可以很壞的
I can be bad.

777
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,590
-好吧  其實這不是我…  -騙人
- Okay, that's not actually what-- - Liar.

778
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,180
冷靜點
Take it easy.

779
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,750
我是說認真的
I am being serious right now.

780
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,700
你覺得我不是認真的
You think I'm not being serious?

781
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,070
我認真的要命
I'm deadly serious.

782
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,800
再叫一遍
Say it again.

783
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,210
你知道嗎
Well, what do you know?

784
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,650
《黑暗騎士崛起》
The Dark Knight Rises.

785
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,310
-她同意了  -是嗎
- She went for it. - She did?

786
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,560
只是有個條件
One catch.

787
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,700
什么
What?

788
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,800
你得簽一份萬無一失的非競爭條款
You have to sign an ironclad noncompete.

789
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,510
如果你離開  你就不能代理
You can't represent any Pearson Specter clients

790
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,910
皮爾遜-斯佩克特的任何客戶
if you leave.

791
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,800
-包括菲爾普斯  -包括菲爾普斯
- Including Phelps? - Including Phelps.

792
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,710
那和之前說的讓我付錢入伙有什么區別
How is that any different than paying in early?

793
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,200
-有五十萬的區別  -哈維
- It's $1/2 million different. - Harvey.

794
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,530
斯科特  這已經是最好的條件了
Scottie, this is the best we're gonna do.

795
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,000
菲爾普斯是個財神
Phelps brings in the money.

796
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,660
但如果你離開了還把他帶走了
But if you leave and take him away,

797
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,170
這對杰西卡有什么好處呢
What good does that do Jessica?

798
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,990
杰西卡還是你
Jessica or you?

799
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,160
你在說笑嗎  你在質疑我嗎
Are you kidding? Are you questioning me?

800
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,500
你之前就總是操縱整個局勢
You've been known to manipulate situations before.

801
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,660
要是我說了算  我就直接讓你入伙了
If it were up to me, I'd waive your whole buy-in.

802
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,290
現在我知道了你就是個人渣
Now I know you're full of shit.

803
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,460
沒錯  我是
You're right, I am.

804
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,320
準備好支票  六個月后  你就得付錢了
So get your check ready, 'cause in six months, you're paying it.

805
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,110
我們真要這么做嗎
Are we really doing this?

806
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,600
簽了它  交給杰西卡
Sign it. Give it to Jessica.

807
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,960
明天我們就在我家吃晚飯慶祝
Tomorrow we'll celebrate with dinner at my place.

808
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,530
你從哪弄來的
Where did you get this?

809
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,550
里納爾迪
Rinaldi.

810
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,860
邁克  我知道你在想什么
Mike, I know what you're thinking,

811
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,930
但法律上來說你父親沒有喝醉
But your father wasn't legally drunk.

812
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,810
是  但他也不是完全清醒
Yeah, but he wasn't sober either.

813
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,780
而且我怎么知道那兩瓶酒
And how do I know those two drinks aren't

814
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,020
是不是剛好就是他...
the split second that he needed not to...

815
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,390
你并不知道那和這次事故
You don't know that this had

816
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,990
有沒有關系
anything to do with the accident.

817
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,620
瑞秋  你知不知道我有多希望
Rachel, do you have any idea how many times I have wished

818
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,910
那晚他們沒有出門
that they hadn't gone out that night

819
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,550
或者他選了別的路線回家
or that they had taken a different route home

820
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,950
或者其他上千種可能
or any one of a thousand other things,

821
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,890
但只有一件  只有一件是我沒想過的
but the one thing--the one thing that I never wished

822
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,640
就是我父親被醉鬼撞死的那晚
is that my father hadn't been drinking

823
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,850
沒喝酒就好了
the night that he got killed by a drunk--

824
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,790
我知道他不是完人
I know he wasn't perfect.

825
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,660
但他曾經是
But he was.

826
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,900
他對我來說是完美的
He was perfect to me, and...

827
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,710
而我不想懷疑
I don't want to have to wonder

828
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,570
這是否全是他的錯
if this is all his fault.

829
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,910
邁克
Mike.

830
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,190
他就是想讓你這樣
He is just trying to get to you.

831
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,290
那他成功了
Well, he's got to me.

832
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,150
我是說  我和他又有什么差別呢  瑞秋
I mean, how am I any different than him, Rachel?

833
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,780
因為這是一起扯淡的訴訟
Because it's a bullshit claim.

834
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,070
我不知道
I don't know.

835
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,040
我知道我會贏
I know I'm gonna win.

836
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,160
但我不知道該不該
But I don't know.

837
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:25,630
你在這啊
Here you are.

838
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,570
-我到處找你來著  -怎么了
- Been looking all over for you. - Why?

839
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,160
我只是想為我侵犯你
I just wanted to apologize once again

840
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,660
電腦里的隱私再次道歉
for crossing the threshold of your electronic area.

841
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,440
沒關系  路易
It's okay, Louis.

842
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,110
不  不  我入侵了你的計算機
No, no, I breached your mainframe.

843
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,340
我愧對你
No excuse.

844
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,260
你的臉怎么這么紅
Why is your face so red?

845
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,340
因為你給了我一個世上最棒的建議
It's because you gave me the greatest advice in the world.

846
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,690
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

847
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,910
總之我永遠不會告訴希拉
Let's just say that I'm never gonna tell sheila what I did

848
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,030
那晚我在檔案室的事  永遠不
in that file room that night, ever.

849
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,430
那我接受你的道歉
Apology accepted.

850
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,550
現在失陪一下
Now if you'll excuse me,

851
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,280
我得往臉上糊點豌豆消腫
I need to put some peas on my face.

852
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,220
你那招沒用  我并沒因此退縮
Your move didn't work. I didn't go into a tailspin.

853
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,690
我沒打算讓你退縮
I wasn't trying to send you into a tailspin.

854
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,010
我只是想讓你了解真相
I was just trying to get you to understand.

855
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,620
我現在了解了
Well, I do understand.

856
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,510
但那不代表我會出賣我的客戶
That doesn't mean I'm gonna sell my client out.

857
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,670
那你是來干嘛的
Then why are we here?

858
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,900
你要起訴  應該起訴這些人
You want to sue someone, you should sue these people.

859
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,270
支架上的藥物涂層
They're the ones that make the medicine

860
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,030
就是他們制作的
that stent was coated with.

861
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,740
你知道這些藥物和這個案子有關嗎
And you know that medicine has something to do with this case?

862
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,370
我知道足夠多的不利于他們的證據
I know there's as much evidence against them

863
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,490
和不利我客戶的證據一樣多
as there is against my client.

864
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,480
你告訴我這些
That's why you're pointing me there,

865
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,130
就因為他們不是你的客戶
because they're not your client.

866
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,910
福爾曼先生不會起死回生
You know, nothing's gonna bring Mr. Foreman back.

867
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,010
就像我的父母
Just like there's nothing

868
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,770
也不會回來了
that's gonna bring my parents back.

869
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,870
這是我能想到讓你客戶得到償金最好的辦法
This is the best way I can see to get your client compensation.

870
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,760
如果你以為你做了正確的事  那你錯了
If you think you're doing the right thing, you're wrong.

871
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,120
我只是想幫忙
I'm trying to help,

872
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,920
但我不會出賣我的客戶
but I'm not gonna sell my client out.

873
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,220
這只是個折衷的辦法
It's a half measure.

874
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,590
好吧  還有另一個辦法
All right, then here's the other half.

875
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,970
我指出的你的致命弱點
I pointed out your Achilles' heel

876
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,650
就是那張照片  我在臉書上找到的
when I found that photo, and I found it on Facebook.

877
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,620
幫你客戶個忙  讓他們在你提交訴訟前
Do your client a favor, and have them take it down

878
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,400
把照片刪掉吧
before you file that suit.

879
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,550
所以你要飛回倫敦  安排好你的生活
So you're gonna fly back to London, get your life in order,

880
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,800
兩周內搬回來
and move back in two weeks.

881
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,510
票已經定好了
Tickets are booked.

882
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,310
敬嶄新的合伙關系
Here's to your new partnership.

883
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,090
我只有一個問題
I just have one question.

884
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,650
為什么杰西卡會明確答應我
Why did Jessica specifically make me agree to something

885
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,810
只有你合同里有的條款
that's a standard part of your contracts?

886
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,360
你查我
You checked up on me.

887
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,830
我沒有查你  我只是深入了解了一下
I didn't check up on you. I'm thorough.

888
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,510
有區別嗎
What's the difference?

889
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,840
老天  哈維  別轉移話題
God damn it, Harvey, don't change the subject.

890
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,260
你做了什么
What did you do?

891
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,140
我替你付了買入股份款
I fronted your buy-in.

892
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,270
我就知道  你買下了我
I knew it. You bought me.

893
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,050
我不是買你  我是給我們倆時間
I didn't buy you, I bought us time.

894
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,240
這是律師的回答  這是扯淡
That is a lawyer's response, and it's bullshit.

895
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,700
你怎么能這么做
How could you do that?

896
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,670
斯科特  你的反應就像我殺了人一樣
Scottie, you're acting like I killed someone.

897
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,630
我沒殺人
I didn't.

898
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,430
你買下我  然后我就能和你睡覺
You paid so that I could sleep with you

899
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,970
同時還能留在這
and be here at the same time!

900
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,700
-你知道這給我什么感覺嗎  -覺得幸運嗎
- Do you know what that makes me? - Lucky?

901
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,890
-不好笑  -我沒搞笑
- That's not funny. - I didn't mean it to be.

902
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,020
我出錢是因為我希望你留下來
I paid because I want you to stay.

903
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,540
我把它當作浪漫之舉
I did it as a romantic gesture.

904
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,440
是啊  美女或許愛演浪漫電影
Yeah, well, pretty woman may have been a romantic movie,

905
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,780
但朱莉亞·羅伯茨還是個妓女
But Julia Roberts was still a hooker.

906
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,270
電影《美麗俏佳人》

907
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,660
又開始說電影了嗎
Now you come up with a movie reference?

908
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,260
哈維  你能想象我發現這件事后
Harvey, can you imagine how that makes me feel

909
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,290
是什么感受嗎
to find that out?

910
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,500
你到底想讓我說什么呢
Well, what do you want me to say, huh?

911
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,070
我不擅長做這種事
I'm not perfect at this,

912
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,240
你也不必把這當作浪漫
and you don't have to believe that was romantic,

913
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,540
但如果你愿意相信我的話是最好了
but it would be nice if you believed that I thought it was.

914
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,530
哈維  如果杰西卡不肯讓步
Harvey, it would have been romantic

915
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,990
而你求著我留下  那才是浪漫
if you had begged me to stay when Jessica wouldn't budge,

916
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,500
但這  這不是浪漫
but this, this is not romantic.

917
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,540
這是操控
This is manipulative.

918
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,090
你都打算去別的地方工作了
You were about to take a job somewhere else.

919
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,480
所以說你操控欲強
That's what makes it manipulative!

920
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,540
你是在說你從沒操控過我嗎
Are you telling me you've never been manipulative with me?

921
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,810
我回來后從沒有過
Not since I've been back.

922
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:44,810
我努力去克服
I had to learn the hard way,

923
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,580
但我恐怕你從沒努力過
and I'm afraid that you haven't learned that at all.

924
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,690
你是說我是個混蛋嗎
So you're saying I'm an asshole?

925
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,770
是啊  我就是這意思  你個混蛋
Yes, that is what I'm saying, that you are an asshole,

926
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,940
但我真正想說的是
but what I'm really saying

927
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,130
我們應該開始對彼此坦誠
is that we need to start being honest with each other.

928
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,980
-坦誠一切嗎  -一切
- About everything? - Everything.

929
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,970
你重做那份試卷
You know that paper you had to redo,

930
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,370
是因為甘恩教授說他沒有收到
because Professor Gunn said he never got it?

931
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,670
他真的沒收到
He never got it.

932
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,830
狗娘養的
Son of a bitch.

933
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,490
我怎么會知道
How was I supposed to know

934
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,810
你沒有存進硬盤里
you didn't save it to your hard drive?

935
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,480
因為我告訴過你
Because I told you that.

936
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,950
你知道你說話的時候  我從來不聽的
You know I don't listen when you say things.

937
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,880
你個混蛋
You are an asshole.

938
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,270
這樣就對了
This is good.

939
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,510
說實話就對了
Honesty is good.

940
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,770
我告訴麗貝卡·卡琳你是基佬
I told Rebecca Carlin you were gay.

941
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,500
但她還是跟我睡了
She slept with me anyway.

942
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,670
只睡了一次
Once.

943
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,220
對啊
Yeah.

944
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,020
她為什么只跟我睡一次呢
Why did she only sleep with me once?

945
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,350
因為我還告訴她你有梅毒
Because I also told her that you had crabs.

946
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,080
真不地道
That's not cool.

947
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,910
這樣真好
This is good.

948
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,460
是啊
It is.

949
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,150
我是認真的  斯科特
I am in this, Scottie.

950
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,700
好吧
Okay.

951
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,320
我也是
So am I.

952
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,400
看看你的成績  邁克爾·詹姆斯·羅斯
Well, let's see what you got, Michael James Ross.

953
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,610
優等成績
Magna cum laude.

954
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,070
連咱們的聰明先生也無法獲得最優成績嗎
So mr. Smarty pants couldn't even manage summa cum laude?

955
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,040
是啊  我也沒得到  又能怎樣
Yeah, well, so what if I couldn't either?

956
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,830
什么  沒上過《法律評論》
What? No Law Review?

957
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,010
要么沒請你  要么你沒投稿
Well, either you weren't asked, or you didn't serve.

958
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,420
管他呢  我贏了
Either way, I win.

959
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,190
"A"
"A."

960
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,660
"A"
"A."

961
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,430
國際法"B+"
B-plus in International Law?

962
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,550
拜托  我閉著眼睛都拿了最高分
Oh, come on, I aced that class with my eyes closed.

963
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,880
合同法"A"  這才像話
"A" in Contracts. That's legit.

964
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,460
遺產規劃"A-"
A-minus in Estate Planning?

965
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:43,300
邁克要是在  可別忘了無囑而終
Remind me to not die intestate with Mike Ross around.

966
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,230
你要的卷尺
Tape measure, as requested.

967
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,640
看起來很興奮啊
You look really excited.

968
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,160
-今天好辛苦  -是啊
- Long day. - I know.

969
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,310
我們能不能先放下手頭的活
Is there any chance we can punt this,

970
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,800
去吃點東西
maybe go grab some dinner?

971
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,160
行啊  或者我們也可以想想
We could, or we could accept that moving in together

972
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,090
住在一起也許就意味著我們得不計前嫌
sometimes means we have to just shake off our crappy days

973
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,850
處理一些事情  比如商量一下家具
and deal with things like furniture negotiations.

974
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,510
是啊  這聽上去
Yeah, that doesn't sound

975
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,710
我是不可能接受的啊
like anything I want to accept at all.

976
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,680
那慘了
Too bad.

977
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,450
這是你的命了
This is your life now.

978
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,240
瑞秋  聽我說  我想
Rachel, look, I'm trying...

979
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,440
你說你爸爸喜歡慶祝一些小事情
You said that your dad liked to celebrate the little things,

980
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,890
我想也許我們也該開始那么做
and I thought maybe we should start doing that too.

981
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,670
比如商量家具嗎
You mean like furniture negotiations?

982
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,670
我是說我們的初次約會
I mean our first date.

983
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,450
看來我什么也別想吃了
So does that mean I'm not gonna be able to eat anything?

984
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,060
因為那晚菜單上的東西我都不喜歡
'cause I didn't like anything on the menu that night.

985
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,740
那不是我們的初次約會
That wasn't our first date.

986
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,070
我們初次約會是在法律圖書室
Our first date was in the law library.

987
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,570
-壽司  -壽司
- Sushi. - Sushi.

988
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,190
那是我的第一個案子
That was my first case.

989
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,580
我知道
I know.

990
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,240
你那時太嫩了
Oh, you were so green.

991
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,580
哈維跑進來讓咱們別在桌底下調情
Harvey came in and told us to stop playing footsie.

992
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,860
我還記得
Oh, I remember that.

993
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,970
我那時可不止想跟你在桌底下調情
I wanted to do a lot more than play footsie with you.

994
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,830
我知道
I know.

995
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,420
我看到你看了我五次
I caught you staring at me five times.

996
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,160
那看來還有好多次你沒看到
Oh, so I guess you didn't catch all the other times then.

997
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,760
我看到了  只是想放你一馬
I did, just trying to let you off the hook.

998
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,160
瑞秋
Rachel...

999
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,110
這太完美了
This is perfect.

1000
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,000
還沒呢
Not yet.

1001
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,260
現在才完美
Now it is.

1002
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,480
椅子在哪里
So where's the chair?

1003
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,220
不行
No.

1004
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,200
您找我
You wanted to see me?

1005
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,720
你有沒有上吉拉德教授的法律職業道德課
Professor Gerard's legal ethics class--you take it?

1006
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,560
當然有了  每個人都得上的
Of course, everyone had to take it.

1007
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,780
你得了多少分
What'd you get?

1008
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,960
輕松拿下  我拿了個"A-"
Killed it. I got an a-minus.

1009
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,560
不奇怪
Out of curiosity,

1010
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,910
你聽說過誰得了"A+"嗎
did you ever hear of anybody ever getting an a-plus?

1011
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,090
什么  沒有
What? No.

1012
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,180
他就是以給分不超過"A"出名的
He's famous for never giving higher than an "A."

1013
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,310
他不搞這套
He doesn't believe in it.

1014
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,980
謝謝  薩蒙  沒事了
Thank you, Simon. That'll be all.
