《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on Suits

8
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,760
你的名字挂在墙上了
You got your name on the wall.

9
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,500
现在我想要与之匹配的尊重
Now I want the respect that comes with it.

10
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,480
意思是
Meaning?

11
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,040
我想要哈维的一个客户
I want one of Harvey's clients.

12
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,720
我的客户就是我的客户
My clients are my clients.

13
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,850
如果你不在三秒钟内
And you don't get out of my office

14
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,000
离开我的办公室
in the next three seconds,

15
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,700
你我之间一定有事发生
something's gonna happen between you and me,

16
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,910
而且我保证  此事一旦发生
and I guarantee it won't end with you

17
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,540
你的牙肯定保不全
keeping all of your teeth.

18
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,270
艾弗里·麦肯诺曾经是
Avery McKernon was the first client

19
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,530
我带进律所的第一位客户
I ever brought into the firm.

20
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,430
他们总是赢家  就像我
They win, like me.

21
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,480
他们知道特雷弗不是那个班里的
They know Trevor isn't in the class,

22
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,270
所以他不可能是偷试题的那个人
so they know he couldn't have been the one to steal the test.

23
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,490
我不开除你的朋友
I'm not going to expel your friend.

24
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,340
非常感谢您  先生
Oh, thank you, sir.

25
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,340
但是有一点
There's just one thing.

26
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,310
我就打电话给哈佛
I'm gonna call Harvard.

27
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,710
你听我说
Believe me when I tell you,

28
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,370
你是永远去不了哈佛了
You're never going there.

29
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,630
记得这个吗
Remember this?

30
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,760
不  你不记得
No, you don't,

31
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,790
因为你不可能记得没见过的东西
because you can't remember something you never knew.

32
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,870
你不能解雇我
You can't fire me.

33
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,590
我为什么要解雇你  我可以击溃你
Why would I fire you when I can break you?

34
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,980
我要把你埋在一大堆破烂底下
You see, I'm going to bury you under a mountain of shit so big

35
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,600
你会求我把它挪走
you're going to be begging me to take it off.

36
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,900
先那杯曼哈顿给我
First of all, give me that Manhattan

37
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,320
再去点一杯男人会点的酒
and go get yourself a drink a man would order.

38
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,700
15分钟后回来
Come back here in 15 minutes,

39
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,490
如果我还记得你是谁  我就
and if I still remember who you are, I'll be shocked.

40
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,020
好了  我们到底来这儿干什么
Okay, so why are we really here?

41
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,740
你带我出来
I mean, you didn't just bring me 

42
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,770
不会只是为了聊卡丽熙吧
out to talk about Khaleesi.

43
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,590
就是啊  保罗·波特说我长得像她的侍女翻译
I did. Paul Porter says I look like her translator.

44
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,510
他也是冰火粉啊
He's a Throner?

45
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,750
不过他说我不如她的小翻译性感
Though he says I'm a less-attractive version of her translator.

46
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,140
好吧  你只是想让我说
Okay, you're just trying to get me to say

47
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,290
你比她性感
that you're hotter than her.

48
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,210
-我是不是嘛  -你性感多了
- Am I? - You're way hotter.

49
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,470
但她口音很撩人
But she has that accent.

50
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,110
我实事求是
Fair point.

51
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,280
好吧  我带你来这儿
You know, look, the reason that I brought you here

52
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,340
是想告诉你  我知道你告诉路易
is to tell you that I know that you told Louis

53
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,040
我给卡特里娜找了份工作
that I got Katrina a job.

54
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,700
-听我说  -别担心  我没生你气
- Look, I -- - Relax, I'm not mad at you.

55
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,350
但我记得是你
But I do remember you being the person

56
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,750
告诉我不要强求
who told me not to force things

57
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,160
-求不来的东西  -瑞秋
- that weren't meant to be. - Rachel, 

58
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,470
一个人给别人建议
just because a person gives advice

59
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,910
不代表自己一定会遵守
doesn't mean that they have to follow that same advice.

60
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,660
这是《唐娜之书》的核心原则之一
That's one of the core principles outlined in "The Book of Donna."

61
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,420
说真的  我也不是有意告诉路易的
Seriously, though, I didn't mean to tell Louis.

62
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,960
就是脱口而出了  抱歉
It just came out. I'm sorry.

63
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,160
我说了  没事
Like I said, it's fine.

64
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,270
他其实还来问我们能不能重新做朋友
He actually ended up asking if we could be friends again.

65
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,130
然后呢
And?

66
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,860
我跟他说  我们之间不可能和好如初
And I told him that things would never be the same between us

67
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,430
除非他原谅迈克
unless he forgave Mike.

68
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,370
他怎么说
And what did he say?

69
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,470
他说他做不到
He said he couldn't do it.

70
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,810
简单  过埃卢跳投
That's easy. The jumper over Ehlo.

71
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,350
错  换手单手上篮  过珀金斯和格林
Wrong, the switch-hand layup over Perkins and Green.

72
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,350
你真让我吃惊啊  哈维
I'm surprised at you, Harvey.

73
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,880
过埃卢跳投足以拿下比赛
The Ehlo jumper was a game-winner.

74
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,220
单手上篮是种挑衅
The layup was a statement.

75
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,460
"我想干什么都行  这比赛我赢定了"
"I can do whatever I want. I own this league."

76
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,710
你是在说乔丹还是你自己
Are you talking about Jordan or yourself now?

77
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,610
有区别吗
Is there a difference?

78
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,550
区别大了
A big difference,

79
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,820
这就要说到我来的原因
which brings me to why I'm here.

80
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,880
你不能随心所欲  哈维
You can't do whatever you want, Harvey.

81
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,210
你要我跟路易修好
You want me to make things right with Louis.

82
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,810
他帮助了我和杰夫
He made things right between Jeff and me.

83
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,570
那我就要为此永远巴结他吗
So I'm supposed to kiss his ass forever because of that?

84
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,850
不  你要跟他和好
No, you're supposed to make peace.

85
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,470
杰西卡  我乐意和好
Jessica, I'm willing to make peace,

86
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,440
但那是不可能的
but that's never gonna happen.

87
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,190
为什么
Why not?

88
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,110
因为路易是绝不会原谅迈克的
Because Louis is never gonna forgive Mike.

89
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,110
那就想办法让他原谅迈克
Then figure out a way to make him forgive Mike.

90
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,640
{\an8}六年前

91
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,630
唐娜  我说过多少次了
Donna, how many times have I told you

92
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,830
你要坐在外面
I want you out front?

93
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,800
我是唯一有秘书的初级律师
I'm the only associate with a secretary.

94
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,730
我希望人们都看到我的秘书
It would be nice if people could see my secretary.

95
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,780
那让你的下任秘书  想办法不进你办公室
Well, then maybe your next secretary can figure out

96
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,390
把这个放好吧
where to put this without coming into your office.

97
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,140
-开玩笑吧  -没有
- You're kidding? - Not kidding.

98
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,200
这不是你伪造的吗
You didn't forge this?

99
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,740
我很厉害  但我不是禽兽
I am a lot of things, but I am not a monster.

100
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,090
我既不会这么对迈克尔也不会这么对你
I would do that to neither Michael nor you.

101
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,150
-叫这么亲啊  -他直呼我教名
- Oh, so he's Michael now? - Well, I'm Donna to him.

102
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,970
我也这么喊他  空中传奇大人打电话来时
He's Michael to me, which is what I told His Airness

103
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,080
我就这么说的
when he called.

104
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,510
等等  你不是在开玩笑
Wait a second. You're not kidding.

105
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,550
他跟我签约了
He signed with me?

106
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,950
严格说  是跟我签约了
Well, technically, he signed with me.

107
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,050
我去  唐娜  我们今晚得庆祝啊
Holy shit, Donna. We have to celebrate tonight.

108
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,470
我是要庆祝
Oh, I'm gonna celebrate.

109
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,660
但你呢  得跟路易喝酒
You, on the other hand, are having drinks with Louis.

110
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,250
什么  我们说过了
What? We've been over this.

111
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,240
不论路易什么时候提出要跟我喝酒
Whenever Louis asks to have drinks with me,

112
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,260
永远拒绝他
the answer's always no.

113
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,590
听好我说的话
Listen to the words that I'm saying.

114
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,110
你今晚要去跟路易喝酒
You are getting drinks with Louis tonight.

115
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,190
费尔柴德要退休了
Fairchild's retiring?

116
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,280
费尔柴德死了
Fairchild's dead.

117
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,470
几乎跟乔丹的消息一样棒了
That's almost as good as the Jordan news.

118
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,270
对费尔柴德可不算
Not to Fairchild.

119
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,870
谁管费尔柴德怎么样啊
Who gives a shit about Fairchild?

120
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,940
真正的悲剧是我要跟路易喝酒
The real tragedy is I have to get drinks with Louis.

121
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,680
所以我给你订了一间小众餐厅
Which is why I got you a secluded restaurant

122
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,850
后面的桌子  没人会看到你的
with a table in the back where no one will see you.

123
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,440
过半小时你会打电话来
And you'll call a half an hour in 

124
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,660
说有急事要处理吧
and say there's an emergency.

125
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,810
已经准备好了  如果打不通
Already in place, and if I can't get through,

126
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,920
我会让侍者
then I'll just have the waiter 

127
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
把酒洒在路易身上
spill drinks all over Louis.

128
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,730
-这你也能做到  -拜托
- You could have that done? - Oh, please.

129
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,950
如果我想  可以让
I could have Louis held captive

130
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,830
路易被人关在一间西藏寺院里
in a Tibetan monastery if I wanted to.

131
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,210
我觉得这你做不到...
Yeah, I don't think you have that--

132
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,740
赶紧滚出你办公室吧
Now get the hell out of your office.

133
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,900
我还有工作呢
I got work to do.

134
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,040
打扰  请问能告诉我
Excuse me. Can you tell me where 

135
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,420
吉姆·奥唐纳德的办公室在哪吗
Jim O'Donnell's office is?

136
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,510
看情况了  你对移民法有什么了解
That depends. What do you know about immigration law?

137
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,290
是签证问题
What, are we talking visas,

138
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,500
还是想搞定劳工证
or are you trying to process a labor certification?

139
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,470
你懂移民法
You know about immigration law?

140
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,240
谁不知道啊
Doesn't everybody?

141
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,850
好吧  拽哥
Okay, tough guy,

142
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,110
你觉得我的策略如何
what do you think about my strategy on this?

143
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,770
我觉得能赢
I think it's a winner. 

144
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,850
为什么
Why is that?

145
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,970
因为人人都知道冈萨雷斯诉马里兰州
Because everyone knows Gonzalez versus State of Maryland

146
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,810
是个了不起的先例  但你这件更好
was a kick-ass precedent, but your case is better.

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,590
的确是个了不起的先例
It was a kick-ass precedent,

148
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,490
但我不知道我这个是不是更好
but I'm not sure that my case is better.

149
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,470
绝对是
Oh, it is.

150
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,430
那维特利诉...
Well, what about Viteri versus--

151
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,220
相信我  这个更好
Trust me, it's better.

152
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,740
维特利靠魔法和同情他们的法官才拿下了案子
Viteri needed magic dust and a sympathetic judge to win.

153
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,070
-我们见过吗  -没有
- Have we met? - Nope.

154
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,630
顺说  我叫迈克
But I'm Mike, by the way.

155
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,200
克莱尔
Claire.

156
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,150
你确定吗  你好眼熟
Are you sure? Because you look very familiar.

157
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,030
那可能是因为我一直往这里送快递
Oh, that's probably because I've been delivering packages

158
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,490
都有俩月了
to your office for the last two months.

159
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,870
但你根本不理我[连时间都不肯告诉]
but you haven't given me the time of day,

160
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,440
因为你觉得我配你不够聪明
because you didn't think I was smart enough for you.

161
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,210
9点15分
It's 9:15.

162
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,940
等等  这样管用吗
Wait. That worked?

163
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,870
目前为止还管用  但如果想继续有用
It's working so far, but I'm gonna need to know

164
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,470
你得跟我说说你的详细情况
your full story if it's gonna keep working.

165
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,330
我会跟你说详细情况
Well, I'll tell you the full story

166
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,520
只要你给我你的电话号码
once you give me your phone number.

167
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,900
等我了解了详细情况  就会告诉你我的电话号码
I'll give you my number when I know the full story.

168
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,890
不如这样  我明天晚餐时告诉你
How about this? I'll tell you everything you want to know

169
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,710
你想知道的一切
at dinner tomorrow night.

170
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,220
那样的话
In that case, 

171
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,140
我可以带你去吉姆·奥唐纳德的办公室
I'll show you where Jim O'Donnell's office is.

172
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,800
吉姆·奥唐纳德的办公室
Jim O'Donnell's office?

173
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,720
你觉得我刚刚从哪儿来的
Where do you think I just came from?

174
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,880
我要你帮我点忙
I need you do something for me.

175
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,800
行  什么忙
Okay, what is it?

176
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,310
不用管是什么
Never mind what it is.

177
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,220
你要不想回去干我雇你之前的老本行
Unless you want to go back to whatever you were doing

178
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,940
就明早九点到这个地方
before I hired you, you'll be here at 9:00 a.m.

179
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,830
这是你的汽车俱乐部的地址
This is the address for your car club.

180
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,940
对  你记忆力确实好
Oh, yeah, your memory.

181
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,990
我凭你的记忆力也能记住这个
I'd remember this even if I had your memory.

182
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,900
就在我们合作的第一个案子前去过
It was right before our first case together.

183
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,540
没错  麦肯诺汽车公司
You're right, McKernon Motors.

184
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,590
这次一定要准时  系好安全带
So this time be on time and put your seat belt on,

185
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,120
我们要开上记忆的轨道了
because we're about to take a trip down memory lane.

186
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,980
早上好  亲爱的
Morning, sunshine.

187
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,370
-你在干...  -你管这个叫普鲁尼吧
- What are you -- - I think you call it a Prunie.

188
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,480
恭喜啊
Congratulations, 

189
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,210
唐娜把我最爱的早餐饮料都告诉你了
Donna told you my favorite breakfast drink,

190
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,910
但那跟南极洲茶的价格有什么关系呢
but what does that have to do with the price of tea in Antarctica?

191
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,750
唐娜还告诉我你被激怒了
Donna also told me that you were pissed,

192
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,780
因为你发现我给了你一个
because you found out I gave you a client

193
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,390
我起初不想要的客户
I didn't want in the first place.

194
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,050
而你觉得这样就能弥补了吗
And you think this is gonna make up for that?

195
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,430
不能  但我想给你麦肯诺汽车一半业务就能
No, but I think giving you 50% of McKernon Motors will.

196
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,740
条件是什么
What's the catch?

197
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,750
条件就是  你我现在马上
The catch is, you and I are about to take a road trip

198
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,340
开车去他们公司总部
to their corporate headquarters right now.

199
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:50,940
你说真的吗
You serious?

200
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,670
我可不拿麦肯诺汽车公司开玩笑
I don't joke about McKernon Motors,

201
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,500
这点你跟我一样了解
and you know that as well as I do.

202
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,420
敬费尔切尔德
To Fairchild.

203
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,280
敬费尔切尔德  愿主保佑他灵魂安息
To Fairchild. God rest his soul.

204
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,390
去他的灵魂
Screw his soul.

205
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,890
你知道他们现在怎么表达
You know how they say

206
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,020
"天堂又多了一位天使"吗
"Heaven just got another angel"?

207
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,660
他们现在都不这么说了
They ain't saying it now.

208
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,200
你为什么一直看你的手机
Why do you keep checking your phone?

209
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,690
-没什么  我只是  -拜托  我又不傻
- No reason. I just-- - Please, I'm not an idiot.

210
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,160
我们到这儿已经28分钟了  再过2分钟
We've been here 28 minutes, and in 2 minutes,

211
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,100
唐娜就会打电话来说一个预先计划的紧急情况
Donna's gonna call with some preplanned emergency.

212
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,870
-路易  不是...  -听着
- Louis, that's not... - Look

213
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,990
你为什么认为我利用费尔切尔德退休
why do you think I used Fairchild's retirement

214
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,100
好让你跟我一起喝酒
to get you to have drinks with me?

215
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,620
因为你知道我觉得那永远不可能吗
Because you knew I thought it would never happen?

216
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,490
因为他没有法定继承人
Because he doesn't have an heir apparent.

217
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,610
路易  如果你在考虑的事如我所想
Louis, if you're thinking what I think you're thinking--

218
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,310
哈德曼不会让我们之一当资深合伙人的
Hardman's not gonna make one of us senior partner.

219
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,680
我不是说我们之一
I'm not talking about one of us.

220
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,260
我说的是我们俩一起说服哈德曼
I'm talking about both of us convincing Hardman

221
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,200
两个厉害的初级合伙人
that two kick-ass junior partners are worth

222
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,650
跟一个新的高级合伙人一样厉害
as much as one new senior partner.

223
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,090
路易  这是我认识你以来
Louis, that is the best idea 

224
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,420
你想出的最好的点子
you've had since I've known you.

225
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,310
是吗
Yeah?

226
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
还有一个
Here's another one.

227
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,270
{\an8}皮尔逊·哈德曼·斯佩克特·利特

228
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,480
你什么时候想出的这个
When did you come up with this one?

229
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,460
你在洗手间浪费掉
When you were in the bathroom wasting 

230
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,860
我们这半小时里的7分钟时
7 minutes of our half hour.

231
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,590
你不用接吗
Don't you have to get that?

232
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,310
不  不用
No, I don't.

233
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,780
来喝酒庆祝吧
Let's drink to this.

234
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,100
混蛋
Asshole.

235
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,950
那是唐娜  不是吗
That was Donna, wasn't it?

236
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,790
特雷弗  这太傻了
Trevor, this is so stupid.

237
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,840
一点也不傻  蠢货
It's not stupid, dickhead.

238
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,110
我要你站在房子正中间
I want you to see it for the first time

239
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,190
第一次好好看
from the middle of the room.

240
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,150
这是你的公寓  笨蛋
It's your apartment, assface,

241
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,000
别想再给我抹一脖子口水
and don't even think about giving me a wet Willie.

242
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,710
你把好玩的都毁了
You suck the fun out of everything.

243
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,410
去吧  睁开眼就  蠢咖
Go ahead. Open your eyes, dickfoot.

244
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,230
-蠢咖  -我本想说笨蛋
- "Dickfoot"? - I was gonna use "Assface."

245
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,940
我只能想到这些
It's all I could think of.

246
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,370
你进社会要怎么办啊
How do you even manage in the world?

247
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,010
你打算继续站在那里闭着眼睛
Are you just gonna stand there with your your eyes closed

248
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,260
嘲笑我的蠢咖吗
and mock my "Dickfoot"?

249
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,570
我才不要睁眼看你的蠢咖
I'm definitely not gonna open them to see your dickfoot.

250
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,180
这倒是说得不错  我也不要
That's a good point. I wouldn't do that either.

251
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,420
快点  睁开眼睛
Go ahead. Open your eyes.

252
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,440
老天呐
Holy shit.

253
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,300
我以为你在弄工作室
I thought you were getting a studio.

254
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,500
是啊  我本来是这么打算  但我发现
Yeah, I was going to, but then I realized

255
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,460
我们不可能一起住在工作室里
we can't both live in a studio.

256
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,510
什么
What?

257
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,730
欢迎光临埃文斯和罗斯之家
Welcome to Casa Evans and Ross.

258
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,010
特雷弗  我付不起一半的房租
Trevor, I can't afford half this rent.

259
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,160
这就是最棒的地方
That's the best part.

260
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,130
不用担心
Don't worry about it.

261
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,620
第一年我会把你的房租全付了
I'm gonna pay for your whole first year.

262
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,440
不  不行  我不能让你帮我付
No, you're not. I can't let you do that.

263
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,390
迈克  我这周二开始新工作
Michael, I start my new job on Tuesday.

264
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,470
除此之外  我还可以做我的伙伴家族生意
On top of that, I have my friends and family business on the side.

265
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,370
那不意味着我要接受你的救济
That doesn't mean I'm gonna take charity from you.

266
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,860
听着  你要逼我说出来吗
Look, are you gonna make me say it?

267
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,150
这不是救济
It's not charity.

268
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,400
我大学毕业了  你没有
I graduated, and you didn't,

269
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,370
因为你为我做的事情顶罪
because you took the fall for something I did.

270
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,010
我欠你的
I owe you.

271
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,080
好吧  我再考虑考虑
Okay, I'll think about it.

272
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,890
好吧  同时也考虑一下这个
All right, in the meantime, think about this.

273
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,450
不  不行
No, I can't.

274
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,790
-我今晚有约会  -好吧
- I got a date tonight. - All right.

275
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,910
怪咖  小胡子  还是全部的
Wow, clubfoot, mustache, all of the above?

276
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,580
先是蠢咖  现在又是怪咖
First dickfoot and then clubfoot?

277
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,660
你现在只会说带"咖"字的词了吗
Are words with "foot" all you've got now?

278
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,830
好吧  聪明人
All right, smart guy, 

279
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,940
用你的SAT单词来形容那妹子吧
describe her with one of your SAT words.

280
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,570
-大咖  -这才像话
- Bigfoot. - That's what I'm talking about.

281
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,530
准确地说  她真是辣妹
For the record, she's really hot.

282
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,480
我直说吧
Let me get this straight.

283
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,650
你们要我提拔你们作初级合伙人
Instead of promoting an existing partner,

284
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,510
而不是提拔现有合伙人
you want me to make both of you junior partners.

285
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,200
不是"提拔"  我们赢得的
Well, not make us. We've earned it.

286
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,030
赢得合伙人的地位
Earned partnership status?

287
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,460
这对两个五年律师来说
That's a pretty bold statement

288
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,640
可是相当大胆的提议
coming from two fifth-years.

289
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,060
不是随便的五年律师
Not just any fifth-years.

290
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,240
我们是律所史上  两个最棒的五年
We're the best fifth-years this firm has ever seen,

291
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,140
你也知道的
and you know it.

292
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,510
我能问问这是谁的主意吗
May I inquire whose idea this was?

293
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,010
-我们俩的主意  -路易的主意
- It was both of ours. - It was Louis'.

294
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,330
你可真慷慨
That's generous of you

295
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,620
把功劳都给他了
to give him credit.

296
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,420
慷慨的是他主动来找我分享主意
It was generous of him to come to me with the idea.

297
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,060
事实是  我本不想提拔任何合伙人
The truth is, I wasn't gonna make anyone partner.

298
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,830
但我欣赏你们的勇气
But I do like admire your gumption.

299
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,540
所以我想这样
So here's what I'm willing to do.

300
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,220
我会提拔你们其中那个
I will advance one of you 

301
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,010
能证明自己值得被提拔的人
if you prove to me which one it should be.

302
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,680
不  你看  问题是
No, see, that's the whole point.

303
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,780
我们是一起的
We came in as a package deal.

304
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,450
你们来找我提价
You came in with a proposal.

305
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,890
我还个价  你们要么接受  要么放弃
I'm giving you a counter, and it's take it or leave it.

306
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,710
怎么证明
What sort of proof are we talking about?

307
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,890
去拿下麦肯诺汽车公司
Let's just say McKernon Motors is in play,

308
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,300
拿下他们  就是对自己有力的证明
and landing them could go a long way to making your case.

309
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,470
不行  我们不会...
No way. We're not gonna..

310
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,760
好吧  丹尼尔
All right, Daniel.

311
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,010
你要麦肯诺
You want McKernon?

312
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,220
我会给你麦肯诺
I'll get you McKernon.

313
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,810
我们要去麦肯诺汽车公司  不是你的高中舞会
We're going to McKernon Motors, not your senior prom.

314
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,340
为什么我们不能做个车辆服务
Why can't we just take the car service?

315
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,470
因为我们是要去见发动机制造商
Because we're going to an engine manufacturer.

316
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,520
我们得开一辆炫车去
We need to show up with a bad-ass car.

317
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,330
这辆酷车怎么样
How about this little bad boy right here?

318
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,290
不好
That's no good.

319
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,040
怎么不好
Why the hell not?

320
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,990
因为不只是我们两个人去
Because it's not just the two of us.

321
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,500
什么意思
What do you mean?

322
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,810
你这混蛋
You son of a bitch.

323
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,490
你说你和我两人去
You said you and I are going up there.

324
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,230
你骗了我
You lied to me.

325
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,610
如果不那么说  你是不会来的
Because if I didn't, you would have never agreed to come.

326
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,910
我不去了
There is no way I'm going.

327
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,160
你要去
Yes, you are.

328
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,490
有必要的话我会把你绑在车顶上带去
I don't care if I have to tie you to the roof.

329
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,800
去麦肯诺的这段时间
By the time we get to McKernon,

330
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,960
你和迈克要把问题好好解决掉
you and Mike are gonna work your shit out.

331
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,830
难以置信  你居然那么做事
I can't believe you did that.

332
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,700
我们的计划是建立统一战线
The plan was to present a united front.

333
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,810
我们建立了  但他不买账
And we did, and he didn't go for it.

334
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,800
那你就倒打我一耙吗
Then you stab me in the back?

335
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,950
我没有倒打一耙  我接受了他给的条件
I didn't stab you in the back. I took what he gave us.

336
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,390
他什么都没给  哈维
He didn't give us anything, Harvey.

337
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,300
他挑拨我们反目
He pitted us against each other.

338
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,120
路易  咱俩第一天见面起
Louis, we've been pitted against each other 

339
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,160
就是对手了
since day one.

340
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,940
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

341
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,150
跟我们一起进公司的五十名律师
How many of the 50 associates we started with

342
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,750
你觉得有多少人能当合伙人
do you think are gonna make partner?

343
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,140
我不管其他律师
I don't give a shit about the other associates.

344
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,570
我们为统一战线而干了杯
We toasted to making partner together.

345
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,810
规则不是我定的  路易  哈德曼定的
I don't make the rules, Louis. Hardman does.

346
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,890
尽管我们骂他混球
And as much as we say he's an asshole,

347
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,680
我也尊敬他这种有事明说做法
I respect him for at least telling us the deal out loud.

348
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,580
你喜欢有事明说
You want something out loud?

349
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,130
那我就跟你明说
I'm gonna give you something out loud.

350
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,000
我是不会让你拿到麦肯诺汽车公司的
No way on Earth am I gonna let you land McKernon Motors.

351
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,510
-干什么  -什么干什么
- Hey, what the hell? - What the hell what?

352
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,900
这可不是在兜风  路易
This isn't a joyride, Louis.

353
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,210
你要是不想谈话  就得安静坐着
You don't want to talk, you're gonna sit in silence

354
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,560
直到你准备开口
until you're ready to talk.

355
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,010
你可以让我安静坐着
Well, you can make me sit in silence all you want,

356
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,630
但你不能强迫我跟他合作
but you can't make me work it out with him.

357
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,440
-怎样才能让你跟他合作  路易  -什么
- Then what can, Louis? - Excuse me?

358
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,180
你跟唐娜  跟瑞秋都和好了
You worked it out with Donna and Rachel.

359
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,110
你为了杰西卡跟马龙撒了谎
You lied to Malone for Jessica.

360
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,930
你到底要怎么样才能跟我和好
What's it gonna take to work it out with me?

361
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,600
我原谅了他们  因为他们也是受害者
Well, I forgave those people, because they were victims

362
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,290
他们也被名叫迈克·罗斯的疾病传染了
infected with the disease known as Mike Ross.

363
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,830
如今我不得不跟零号病人一起坐在车里
Now I'm stuck in a car with patient zero.

364
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,730
好吧  疾病爆发  零号病人是第一个
Okay, outbreak, patient zero is the first person

365
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,670
感染疾病的人
actually infected with the disease,

366
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,040
而非疾病本身  提醒你一下
not the disease itself, and for your information,

367
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,820
我也跟你一样困在这车里
I'm stuck in the same car as you.

368
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,780
至少你不用看到
At least you don't have to look at

369
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,890
你自己那个愚蠢的
the back of your own stupid,

370
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,600
肥嘟嘟的秃脑袋
fat, balding head.

371
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,240
有什么可笑的
What's so goddamn funny?

372
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,800
你们终于说话了
You two are finally talking.

373
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,500
奖励你一些音乐
I think you earned a little music.

374
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,540
-就这样  -是啊
- That's it? - Yeah.

375
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,130
你只需要从这两个角色里挑一个
All you have to do is pick one of two characters.

376
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,130
而被我遗弃的那个角色
And whichever character I don't pick

377
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,150
就会被从电影史上永远抹杀
is removed from film history forever?

378
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,460
就像从没存在过一样
It's like they never existed.

379
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,560
小菜一碟
It's a piece of cake.

380
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,820
好吧  汉·索罗或者印第安纳·琼斯
Okay, Han Solo or Indiana Jones?

381
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,320
-不玩了  -怎么了
- I'm out. - What's the problem?

382
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,520
你刚刚还说小菜一碟呢
You just said it was gonna be a piece of cake.

383
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,310
问题是你挑了两个有史以来
The problem is, you just picked the two greatest characters

384
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,110
最棒的角色  所以...
of all time, so...

385
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,390
你说得对  抱歉
You're right about that. I'm sorry.

386
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,580
我说个简单点的
Let me start with something easier for you.

387
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,020
-好吧  -布奇或圣丹斯
- All right. - Butch or Sundance?

388
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,020
{\an8}分别是《星球大战》和《夺宝奇兵》中的角色

389
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,510
结账
Mm, check, please.

390
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,770
到此为止了
Yeah, we're done.

391
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,120
不
No.

392
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,830
感觉真好
This is really nice.

393
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,790
是的  我也很开心
Yeah, I'm having a really good time too.

394
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,390
什么时候告诉我  你除了送快递
So when do I get to hear the answer to what you do

395
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,450
还做什么
besides being a bike messenger?

396
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,360
谁说我做别的事了
Who says I do anything?

397
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,650
听着  迈克  快递没什么不好
Look, Mike, there's nothing wrong

398
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,880
但是  我对自己的人生很严肃
with being a bike messenger, but I'm serious about my life.

399
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,900
我去法学院并不是为了钱
I'm not going to law school just to cash out.

400
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,300
我真心想帮助别人
I really want to help people.

401
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,620
快递就不能帮助别人吗
Bike messengers don't help people?

402
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,850
我不希望自己恋爱的对象
No, not in the way that a man I want to be

403
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,690
只用这种方法帮助别人
in a relationship with does.

404
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,370
那么  今天你走运了
Well, then today is your lucky day.

405
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,180
我就知道  你要上那个学校
I knew it. Where do you go?

406
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,900
你先说  你要上哪个
Mm-mm, you first. Where do you go?

407
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,310
-纽约大学  -哥伦比亚大学
- NYU. - Columbia.

408
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,590
-我赢了  -我赢了
- I win. - I win.

409
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,570
-早上好  杰西卡  -你好  丹尼尔
- Good morning, Jessica. - Hi, Daniel.

410
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,530
-我还没收到...  -今年的预算吗
- I still haven't received-- - This year's budget?

411
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,180
我正要给你送去呢
I was just on my way to give it to you.

412
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,990
我还以为你一直忙着
And I thought maybe you hadn't gotten around to it

413
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,640
挑拨哈维和路易  没时间做预算呢
because you were too busy pitting Harvey against Louis.

414
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,850
你反对这样吗
You disapprove.

415
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,410
我不介意来点良性竞争
I don't mind a little healthy competition.

416
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,750
但我介意开合伙人资格的空头支票
But I do mind the empty promise of partnership.

417
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,690
你怎么认为最后会没有回报
What makes you so sure there's no reward at the end?

418
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,170
上次我们讨论这个的时候
The last time we discussed this,

419
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,360
你说哈维还没准备好
you said Harvey wasn't ready.

420
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,450
而你说路易没准备好
And you said Louis wasn't.

421
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,490
我是在给他们机会证明自己
Well, I'm giving them both the chance to prove it.

422
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,840
新合伙人的确定已经提上日程了
So partnership is on the table.

423
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,870
早就提上日程了
Partnership was already on the table.

424
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,580
你怎么认定会是哈维
What makes you so sure it's gonna be Harvey?

425
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,570
因为哈维为了获胜不择手段
Because Harvey will do whatever it takes to win.

426
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,310
如果不择手段是评判标准
If doing whatever it takes is the criteria,

427
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,290
那我赌路易会赢
my money is on Louis.

428
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,510
这话是什么意思
What are you talking about?

429
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,000
我们还是去我办公室接着聊吧
I think we should continue this conversation in my office.

430
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:01,080
你好  我来给佐坦·富莱斯美斯特森送邮件
Hi, I've got a delivery for a Zoltan Freastmeisterson.

431
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,830
这间办公室可没有叫这个名字的人
I'm afraid there's no one in this office with that name.

432
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,840
你记错了吧
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

433
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,660
-是吗  -没错
- Really? - Yeah.

434
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,590
我敢打赌地球上都没有
Because I'm willing to bet that there's no one on this planet

435
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,320
叫这个名字的人
with that name.

436
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,870
好吧  但如果你告诉我
Okay, fine, but if you could just point me towards

437
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,380
金桔·麦格利卡迪的办公室在哪
Kumquat McGillicuddy's office,

438
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,640
我就不缠着你了
I'll be on my way,

439
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,210
因为我可没有带着两封假邮件
because I certainly did not bike down here

440
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,390
专门骑车过来就是为了告诉你
with two fictitious deliveries just to tell you

441
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,540
我昨晚很开心
what a great time I had last night.

442
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,430
那就好  因为我有一大堆活要干
Good, because I have a lot of work to do.

443
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,920
所以  如果你能跳上你那辆小自行车...
So, if you could please just hop on that little bike of yours--

444
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,330
-克莱尔  -怎么了
- Claire? - Yeah.

445
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,610
等你跟这位快递员调完情
When you're finished flirting with Quicksilver here,

446
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,230
最好去趟移民局
you might want to get down to INS.

447
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,250
海克特·苏雷兹刚刚被带走了
Hector Suarez just got taken in.

448
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,390
见鬼  他的签证到期了
Shit. His visa's expired.

449
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,210
他们会把他遣返回多米尼加共和国的
They're gonna send him back to the Dominican Republic.

450
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,970
等一下  或许我能帮忙
Wait. Maybe I can help.

451
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,900
不是我看不起你  但我觉得你帮不上...
No offense, I don't see how you can--

452
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,660
不  不  纳森  他不光是个送信员
No, no, no, Nathan, he's not just a bike messenger.

453
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,940
他在念法学院
He's in law school.

454
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,450
真的吗
Really?

455
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,300
-那个学校的法学院  -哥伦比亚大学
- Where are you in law school? - Columbia.

456
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,820
他还恰巧比咱俩都了解签证
And he happens to know visas better than either one of us.

457
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,220
但我没法付你钱  所以...
Well, I really can't pay you, so...

458
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,170
不  不用给钱
No, I don't need any money.

459
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,210
我只是想帮忙而已
I just want to help.

460
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,460
好吧  哥伦比亚小伙  看你的了
All right, Columbia, be my guest.

461
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,590
周二早上九点有个听证会
Got a hearing Tuesday morning, 9:00 A.M.

462
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,340
迈克  太好了  谢谢你
Mike, that is amazing. Thank you.

463
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,770
先别急着谢我  我还什么都没...
Oh, no, don't thank me yet. I haven't even done any--

464
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,640
可能跟这事没什么关系  但我今天早上
Um, this might not be relevant, but I actually saved

465
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,640
救了金桔·麦格利卡迪一命  所以...
Kumquat McGillicuddy's life this morning, so...

466
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,020
我得去准备一下了
I'm gonna go do some work.

467
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,690
谢谢
Thank you.

468
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,740
麦肯诺先生  我是哈维·斯佩克特
Mr. McKernon, Harvey Specter.

469
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,000
斯佩克特先生  你能给我解释一下为什么
Mr. Specter, would you mind telling me why I have

470
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,940
我今天要与皮尔逊·哈德曼律所的
two different Pearson Hardman lawyers

471
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,820
两个律师见面吗
on my schedule today?

472
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,180
我不知道  但跟我谈完
I don't know, but after this,

473
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,740
你就不需要见另一个了
you won't need to meet the other one.

474
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,770
你还真是自以为是
You're cocky.

475
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,750
我不说错话
I'm right.

476
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,280
你也没带多少东西来
You're also traveling a little light.

477
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,540
你的幻灯片展示呢
Where's your PowerPoint presentation?

478
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,730
我不需要幻灯片展示
I don't need a PowerPoint presentation.

479
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:48,980
为什么
Why is that?

480
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,590
因为这座城里每个律师都试过征服你
Because every lawyer in the city has tried to dazzle you,

481
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,060
你却仍在寻找合适的人选
and you're still looking for a date to the big dance,

482
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,680
那是因为他们不知道你看重什么
because they don't know what you're looking for.

483
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,210
你说我看重什么
What exactly am I looking for?

484
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,230
忠诚
Loyalty.

485
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,410
没错
You're right.

486
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,480
我白手起家建立起这间公司
I built this company from the ground up,

487
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,280
跟我共同奋斗的人仍陪在我身旁
and everybody that started with me is still here.

488
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,300
我知道原因
And I know why.

489
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,030
不景气的时候不裁员
You don't downsize in the bad times.

490
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,930
到了好时候他们自然不离不弃
They stick with you in the good times.

491
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,360
别的律师都没想明白这点
And no other lawyer has figured that out.

492
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,610
除了一个人
Not a single one.

493
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,020
那就是我  艾弗里
Well, I'm the one, Avery,

494
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,600
所以我知道你不希望我放弃你
which is why I know you don't want me dumping you

495
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,330
投向另一个更大的客户
for a bigger client down the line.

496
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,190
我怎么知道你不会这么做
How do I know you won't do that?

497
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,760
因为这不是我的工作风格
Because that's not the way I work.

498
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,000
说的倒是好听
Well, it's a hell of a nice sentiment.

499
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,950
但我怎么知道你不是信口雌黄
But how do I know you're not full of shit?

500
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,250
我很高兴你这么问
I'm glad you asked,

501
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,660
因为这就是我的幻灯片
because here's my PowerPoint presentation.

502
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,190
好吧
Okay...

503
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,820
我明天有个听证会  对方是弗莱彻引擎公司
I have a hearing tomorrow against Fletcher Engines.

504
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,940
要是胜诉  你就是我的律师
You win that, you're my lawyer.

505
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,150
别换车道
Ok, just don't change lanes,

506
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,980
别换车道
don't change lanes.

507
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,830
别换  真棒  好吧  知道吗
Don't do this. Great. Okay, you know what?

508
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,410
太荒唐了  你开车跟个野蛮的动物似的
This is ridiculous. You drive like a savage animal.

509
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,150
路易  男人点  忍着吧
Louis, be a man and suck it up.

510
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,850
忍着  我坐在死亡座椅上
Suck it up? I'm sitting in the death seat.

511
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,270
好吧  我靠边停车  你到后面跟迈克坐
Fine. I'll pull over, and you can sit in the back with Mike.

512
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,330
我可不跟一个骗子坐在后面
Hey, I'm not sitting in the back with a fraud,

513
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,480
你想都别想让他坐前面
and before you even think it, you're not putting him up here

514
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,550
把我塞到后面
and sticking me back there.

515
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,560
那你想怎么办  路易
Then what do you want, Louis?

516
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,970
我不可能让你
Because there is no way in hell

517
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,660
来开车
I'm letting you behind the wheel of this car.

518
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,740
解决办法显而易见
It's crystal goddamn clear.

519
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,810
我们坐在后座  让他当我俩的司机
You and I sit in the back, and he chauffeurs the both of us.

520
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,490
这可不行  就算哈维同意
Whoa, no. Even if Harvey would agree to that,

521
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,620
-我对此深表怀疑  -你闭嘴吧
- which I doubt-- - Shut the hell up.

522
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,000
你没有发言权  没有拒绝的资格
You're not talking. You don't get to refuse.

523
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,500
我不是拒绝  路易  我不会开车
I'm not refusing, Louis. I don't know how to drive.

524
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,940
真他妈见鬼
Holy shit.

525
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,410
你想见我
You wanted to see me?

526
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,720
是的
Uh, yes.

527
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,750
我听说艾弗里·麦肯诺那边你干得不错
I heard you did well with Avery McKernon.

528
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,490
那你可听错了
Well, then you heard wrong,

529
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,280
因为我搞定艾弗里·麦肯诺了
because I killed it with Avery McKernon.

530
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,790
-恭喜你  哈维  -谢谢  丹尼尔
- Congratulations, Harvey. - Thank you, Daniel.

531
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,140
不客气
You're welcome.

532
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,200
不幸的是  我们不能代表麦肯诺马达公司
Unfortunately, we can't represent McKernon Motors after all.

533
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,230
为什么不行
Why not?

534
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,260
因为弗莱彻引擎公司想跟我们签约
Well, it turns out Fletcher Engines wants to sign with us.

535
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,800
因为他们发现我就要拿下麦肯诺
Because they found out I'm about to land McKernon.

536
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,740
没错
Yes,

537
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,100
而且他们规模是麦肯诺汽车公司的三倍
and they're three times the size of McKernon Motors.

538
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,460
我才不管他们规模多大
Well, I don't care how big they are.

539
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,230
我不会放弃我的客户
I'm not dropping my client.

540
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,690
你得放弃
Yes, you are.

541
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,830
你一早就计划好了
This was your plan all along.

542
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,900
没错  这世界就是这样的
Of course it was. That's how the world works.

543
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,100
我不管这世界怎么样
I don't give a shit how the world works.

544
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,110
我向艾弗里·麦肯诺保证过
I gave my word to Avery McKernon.

545
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,880
小心点  哈维
Watch yourself, Harvey.

546
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,800
我走到今天靠的不是小心翼翼  丹尼尔
I haven't gotten where I am by watching myself, Daniel.

547
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,090
我也不喜欢被人用来打掩护
And I don't appreciate being used as a stalking horse.

548
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,830
你可以不喜欢  但我提醒你
Well, you may not appreciate it, but let me remind you,

549
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,220
我是你的老板
you work for me.

550
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,600
我在给你机会证明你懂
And I'm giving you the chance to show me you understand that.

551
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,510
别忘了  你说过要增加合伙人
Let me remind you you said partnership was on the table.

552
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,270
我不会让你食言的  杰西卡也不会
I'm gonna hold you to that, and so will Jessica.

553
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,330
吃屁鬼
Hey, fart taster.

554
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,710
我还以为你会来我家
I thought you were coming over.

555
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,790
怎么了  这个名字很经典
What, nothing? It's a classic.

556
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,790
我是指你的工作就是在...
I'm implying your job is to literally taste--

557
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,680
特雷弗  我正在忙
Hey, Trevor, I'm in the middle of something,

558
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,470
我一会儿去找你好吗
so I'll come over later, okay?

559
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,780
忙什么
In the middle of what?

560
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,660
我跟你提过的那个女孩
That girl I told you about,

561
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,010
她在法律援助所实习
she interns at a legal clinic,

562
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,410
我正在帮她处理一个案子
and I am helping her with a case.

563
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,500
"蠢咖"还给你布置作业了
Dickfoot gave you homework?

564
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,790
第一  从现在开始叫她克莱尔
Okay, first of all, from now on, her name is Claire.

565
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,350
第二  这活儿很重要  所以...
And second of all, this is important, so...

566
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,350
老兄  你在说什么
Dude, what the hell are you talking about?

567
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,390
我好像骗她说我在读法学院
I might have told her that I'm in law school.

568
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,990
我了个去
Holy shit.

569
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,520
为了滚床单你什么都做得出来啊
You will do anything to get laid.

570
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,060
我不是为了滚床单
I am not trying to get laid.

571
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,610
我真的很喜欢这个女孩
I really like this girl, 

572
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,160
如果只是个送信的
and I have zero chance with her

573
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,740
我没机会和她在一起
if all I am is a bike messenger.

574
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,430
对  但等她发现你骗她
Yeah, well, you're definitely gonna have no chance

575
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,820
你就更不可能有机会了
if she finds out that you lied to her.

576
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,280
特雷弗  我不想再跟你谈这个了
Trevor, I don't want to talk about this anymore.

577
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,450
你什么都不想再谈了
You don't really want to talk about anything anymore.

578
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,250
和公寓有关  是吗
It's about the apartment, isn't it?

579
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,600
-没错  -好吧  要听实话吗
- Yes it's about the apartment. - Okay, you want the truth?

580
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,520
我没答复你是因为奶奶
I haven't given you an answer because of Grammy.

581
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,310
你以为我不知道
You think I didn't know that?

582
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,980
你也知道她不会原谅你
Then you know she's never forgiven you

583
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,220
大学时做的那些事
for what happened in college,

584
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,520
她是绝对不可能让我和你一起住的
and she is never, ever going to let me live with you.

585
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,450
那就她解释  我是为了
Then explain to her that this is my way

586
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,000
为大学时的错误做补偿
of making up for what I did in college.

587
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,120
没用的
That is never gonna work.

588
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,910
知道吗  迈克尔
You know what, Michael?

589
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,640
如果你能为刚遇见的女孩这么努力
If you're gonna do all of this for some girl you just met,

590
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,260
或许你该在奶奶面前替我说说话了
maybe it's time you stood up to Grammy for me.

591
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,560
和弗莱彻引擎打的怎么样
How'd it go against Fletcher Engines?

592
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,870
把他们打断了腿还是打趴在地
You cut them off at the knees or put them in the ground?

593
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,290
他们把我打趴在地了
They put me in the ground,

594
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,200
更惨的是  还当着艾弗里·麦肯诺的面
and on top of that, it was in front of Avery McKernon.

595
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,620
你败诉了
You lost in court?

596
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,060
不仅败诉  还败得像个傻瓜
I didn't just lose. I looked like a fool.

597
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,080
哈维  怎么了
Harvey, what happened?

598
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,910
弗莱彻引擎公司的律师
The general counsel for Fletcher Engines

599
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,300
早就清楚我的每一步策略
knew every move I was gonna make before I even made it.

600
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:01,940
这怎么可能...
How could he--

601
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,330
因为哈德曼提醒过他了
Because Hardman must have tipped him off.

602
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,440
你真觉得他会那么做吗
You really think he would do that?

603
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,110
我昨天还不确定  今天非常肯定
I wouldn't have yesterday, but I sure as hell do today.

604
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,280
那你得去找杰西卡
Then you have to go to Jessica.

605
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,660
说什么
And say what?

606
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,590
哈德曼是管理合伙人  而她不是
Hardman's managing partner. She's not.

607
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,720
我没有证据  也不可能拿到
I don't have any proof, and I never will.

608
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,000
那你打算怎么做
Well, then what are you gonna do?

609
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,420
不知道  但我还有不到14个小时
I don't know, but I have less than 14 hours

610
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,130
去翻那1000页的专利权法
to dig through 1,000 pages of patent law.

611
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,900
要是律所里恰好有个精通专利权法的人
If only there was somebody in the office who was an expert

612
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,640
就好了
on patent law.

613
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,760
唐娜  我不会去找路易的
Donna, I am not going to Louis.

614
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,840
他绝对不会帮我
He'll never help me.

615
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,100
那真糟糕  如果你不懂
Well, that's too bad, because if you can't figure out

616
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,710
如何与路易和好如初
how to patch things up with Louis,

617
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,790
那你也配不上艾弗里·麦肯诺这客户
then you don't deserve Avery McKernon

618
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,270
以及合伙人的身份
or that partnership.

619
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,360
这是为了什么
What's all this?

620
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,290
孙子就不能为奶奶点餐到家
Uh, a grandson can't order in and set a table

621
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,620
布置餐具吗
for his grandmother?

622
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,020
孙子想做什么都可以
A grandson can do whatever he wants.

623
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,710
但答案还是不行
But the answer to your question is no.

624
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,980
你还没听我的请求呢
You haven't even heard what it is yet.

625
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,270
我知道是什么  因为我从你一毕业
I know what it is, because I've been waiting for it

626
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,800
就在等你问我
since that kid graduated,

627
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,120
你不能和他一起住
and you are not gonna live with him.

628
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,820
是他害你被学校开除
That boy is the reason you got kicked out of school.

629
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,630
是你让我把实情告诉院长的
You're the one that told me to tell the dean the truth.

630
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,050
那是在我知道你会被开除之前
That was before I knew it would cost you graduating.

631
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,750
他现在想补偿我
And he's trying to make it up to me.

632
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,120
他会替我付一整年的房租
He's gonna pay for my whole first year's rent.

633
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,100
这不能弥补他把你的人生
That will not make up for putting your whole life

634
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,250
搅得天翻地覆
into a tailspin.

635
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,620
-这是好的开始  -不  这不是
- It's a head start. - No, it's not a head start!

636
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,500
那孩子会再次把你拖入泥潭
That boy is gonna drag you back down with him!

637
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,830
奶奶  我不会让这种事发生的
Grammy, I'm never gonna let that happen!

638
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,100
该死的  我不允许
God damn it! I forbid it!

639
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,940
抱歉  迈克尔  我失控了
I'm sorry, Michael. I lost my temper.

640
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,460
但我知道他对你做了什么
But I know what he does to you,

641
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,870
我也知道他不会改变
and I know he'll always be the same.

642
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,200
你想过或许我和以前不一样了吗
Has it occurred to you that maybe I'm not the same?

643
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,280
哪儿不一样了
What's changed?

644
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,350
我遇到了一个人
I met someone.

645
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,420
我会想办法完成学业
And I'm gonna figure out a way to finish school, and...

646
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,840
然后我要去读法学院
and then I'm gonna go to law school.

647
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,810
很好
Good.

648
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,280
那就在这里努力
Then do it from here

649
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,550
你在想什么  迈克
What's on your mind, Mike?

650
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,320
你看起来在沉思
You look lost in thought.

651
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,340
我只是想到了我奶奶
I was just thinking about my grandmother.

652
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,750
我们曾坐火车去过一次特区
We took a train trip to D.C. once.

653
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,150
玩《谁是间谍》的游戏
We played I Spy.

654
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,290
故事很动人  迈克  但我们不会玩的
That's a nice story, Mike, but we are not playing I Spy.

655
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,970
我玩  让我想起去看臭烘烘的芙丽塔的路上
I'll play. It'll remind me of Dominating Esther on our trips

656
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,430
玩的《独裁者以斯帖》
to see our smelly Aunt Frida.

657
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,630
好吧  如果这能让你和迈克说说话
All right, if it will get you and Mike talking, sure.

658
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,380
我侦查到一个骗子
I spy a fraud 

659
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,670
他可能从来都不了解自己奶奶
who probably never even knew his grandmother.

660
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,810
够了  你如果对我有意见
All right, God damn it, you got a problem with me,

661
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,540
直接跟我说
take it up with me, 

662
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,150
别扯到我奶奶身上
but don't ever talk about my grandmother again.

663
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,890
我差点忘了
Oh, I forgot,

664
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,950
那个从纽约来的可怜孤儿
the poor orphan from New York City

665
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,490
我应该为他从没学过开车而感到同情
who I should feel sorry for because he never learned to drive.

666
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,660
我警告你  管好自己的嘴
I'm telling you, watch yourself.

667
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,780
为什么  因为我伤害你感情了吗
Why? Because I hurt your feelings?

668
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,670
-路易  -我才不在乎呢
- Louis! - I don't care.

669
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,050
据我所知  你可能根本不是个孤儿
For all I know, you're probably not even an orphan.

670
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:03,590
路易
Louis!

671
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,860
骗子讲这类故事
It sure as hell wouldn't be the first time a con man

672
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,870
可不是第一回了
tried to make that claim.

673
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,050
-够了  -不  不够
- That's enough. - No, it isn't.

674
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,900
确实够了  靠边停车
Yes, it is. Pull the car over right now.

675
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,580
我要好好揍他一顿
I'm gonna beat the shit out of him.

676
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,710
你有空吗
Hey, you got a minute?

677
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,450
等等  让我先转过身
Oh, wait. Let me turn my back,

678
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,700
找个合适的角度让你捅...
so I can give you the right angle to---

679
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,670
你是对的  我们本该团结一致的
You were right. We should have stuck together.

680
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,520
我知道了  你想让我帮忙
I get it-- you need my help,

681
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,980
因为你今天早晨被打了个屁滚尿流
because you got your ass wiped in court this morning.

682
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,320
你说得对  我今天早晨确实被打败了
You're right. I did get my ass kicked this morning,

683
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,080
但那并不是一场公平的战斗
but it wasn't a fair fight.

684
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:37,940
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

685
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,820
哈德曼登陆了我的电脑
Hardman accessed my computer

686
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,160
把我的计划发给了对手
and fed the other side my game plan.

687
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,650
你说的这些
Okay, I'm still waiting for the part

688
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,680
我毫不关心
where I'm supposed to give a shit.

689
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,130
哈德曼这样做是因为我拒绝为了弗莱彻
Hardman did it because I refused to dump McKernon

690
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,160
对我承诺过的麦肯诺食言
for Fletcher after I gave him my word.

691
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,170
你也一直对我食言
And why should I help you

692
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,580
我又为什么要帮你
when you couldn't live up to your word to me?

693
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,080
我没有对你食言
I did live up to my word.

694
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,820
-我们一起去找了丹尼尔  -胡扯
- We went to Daniel-- - Oh, bullshit.

695
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,340
不  这不是胡扯
No, it's not bullshit.

696
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,390
我欣然接受了你的意见
I welcomed your idea with open arms,

697
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,490
而且当他问这是谁的主意时
and by the way, when he asked whose idea it was,

698
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,530
我把功劳全给了你
I gave you the credit.

699
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,270
哈维  这就是你不明白的地方
You see, Harvey, that's the part you will never understand.

700
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,090
我不想要什么功劳
I didn't want the credit.

701
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,050
我想要我们成为一个团队
I wanted us to be a team.

702
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,310
那让我们成为一个团队
Then let's be a team right now.

703
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,690
可你并不真心想要一个团队
But you don't want to be a team.

704
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,970
你想要让我帮你搞定麦肯诺
You want me to help you get McKernon

705
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,120
你好当上合伙人
so you can make partner.

706
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,470
我希望你帮我实现我对艾弗里·麦肯诺的承诺
I want you to help me so I can keep my word to Avery McKernon.

707
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,070
然后等我当上合伙人以后
And when I become partner,

708
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,200
我会严守我对你的承诺
I'll keep my word to you.

709
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,900
什么承诺
What the hell word is that?

710
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,480
承诺有一天你写在餐巾纸上的那些字
That someday what you wrote on that napkin

711
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,510
能够真正挂在那面墙上
goes up on the goddamn wall.

712
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,280
看起来你很用功啊  迈克
You seem to have done a lot of work here, Mike.

713
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,540
没什么大不了的
Oh, it's no big deal.

714
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,880
这很重要
It is a big deal.

715
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,370
迈克在1975年移民法中找到了一个漏洞
Mike found a loophole in the Immigration Act of 1975,

716
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,000
会让你大吃一惊的
and it's gonna blow you away.

717
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,020
那我说不准
I don't know about that,

718
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,320
不过这确实可能帮海克特·苏雷兹留下
but it may help Hector Suarez stay in the country.

719
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,430
那太棒了
That's great.

720
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,940
而且我非常欢迎你留下看庭审情况
And you're more than welcome to stay and watch.

721
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,870
不幸的是  克莱尔
Unfortunately, Claire,

722
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,220
我需要你回办公室一趟
I need you to run back to the office.

723
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,330
马歇尔请病假了
Marshall called in sick.

724
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,480
我需要有人接待无预约委托人  所以
I need someone to handle the walk-ins, so...

725
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,560
好吧
Okay.

726
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,140
打电话告诉我情况怎么样
Call me. Tell me how it goes.

727
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,890
好
Yeah.

728
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,350
你这是在干什么  那...
What the hell are you doing? That's--

729
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,420
帮海克特·苏雷兹留下
Gonna keep Hector Suarez in the country?

730
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,050
是啊
Yeah.

731
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,860
没有任何办法能帮他留下
Yeah, nothing's gonna keep him in the country.

732
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,520
我要做的就是帮他争取一点时间
So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna buy him some time

733
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,060
让他把事情安排好
so he can get his affairs in order,

734
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,280
然后我会争取让他的孩子有机会留下
and then I'm gonna give his children a chance to stay.

735
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,160
我只是...  抱歉
I'm just--I'm--I'm sorry.

736
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,230
你是在嫉妒我和克莱尔吗
Are you jealous of me and Claire or...

737
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,420
我没有嫉妒  而且我一直
Hey, look, I'm not jealous, and I was waiting

738
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,680
等到她离开  免得你尴尬
for her to leave to save you the embarrassment.

739
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,280
尴尬什么
The embarrassment of what?

740
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,010
我的工作做得很好
That's good work.

741
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,800
我说的不是这个
I'm not talking about the work.

742
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,440
我说的是你那套"白天送信 
I'm talking about your "bike messenger by day,

743
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,060
晚上上法学院"的胡话
law student by night" bullshit.

744
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,690
你不知道自己在说什么
All right, you don't know what you're talking about.

745
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,070
你接下来还要告诉我什么
What are you gonna tell me next?

746
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,530
你的室友是个上医学院的脱衣舞男吗
Your roommate is a stripper who's in medical school?

747
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,900
告诉我  如果我现在打给哥伦比亚
Tell me right now--I call Columbia,

748
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,780
你的故事能得到证实
your story holds up.

749
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,190
正如我所料
That's what I thought.

750
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,270
别管我是谁  先看看那些文件行吗
Forget who I am, and take a look at that folder.

751
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,280
-这关乎一个人的生活  -别碰我
- This is a man's life. - Don't touch me.

752
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,340
如果你知道为自己好
If you know what's good for you,

753
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,220
就该离克莱尔远远的
you'll stay the hell away from Claire.

754
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,660
丹尼尔
Daniel...

755
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,230
你知不知道有些特殊的品种
Did you know that some of these species

756
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,280
可以活两百年
can live up to 200 years?

757
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,230
太神奇了
Fascinating.

758
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,090
那你知道弗莱彻引擎公司被打得丢盔卸甲吗
Did you know Fletcher Engines is picking up the pieces?

759
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,970
我猜我应该恭喜你
I guess congratulations are in order.

760
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,430
我来不是为了你的表扬
I not here for a pat on the back.

761
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,350
我来是告诉你  你得让我当合伙人
I'm here to tell you you're making me partner.

762
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,630
合伙人
Partner?

763
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,510
我从没说过签下麦肯诺就可以当合伙人
I never said signing McKernon was the key to making partner.

764
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,600
-你说过  -我说的只是签下他们
- Yes, you-- - All I said was landing them could go a long way

765
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,960
会大大增加你的优势
toward making your case.

766
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,920
胡扯
Bullshit.

767
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,820
你说会任命新合伙人
You said partnership was on the table.

768
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,600
而且我说过不会让你食言
And I said I was gonna hold you to it.

769
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,280
现在我就要去
And I'm going to right now.

770
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,720
你没权利让我做任何事情
You don't hold me to anything.

771
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,590
不过我确实说过会决定合伙人
But I did say partnership was on the table,

772
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,730
我也确实做了决定
and it is...

773
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,110
只不过不是你
just not for you.

774
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,440
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

775
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,870
我总不能在告诉路易让他当合伙人后
Well, I can't very well make you partner

776
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,360
再让你当合伙人吧
after I just told Louis I'm making him partner.

777
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,530
什么
What?

778
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,160
你还不明白  是吗
You don't get it, do you?

779
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,710
这并不在于签下新的委托人
This isn't about bringing in business.

780
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,270
在于找出谁会不惜一切去争取
This is about figuring out who would do whatever it takes.

781
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,170
我不惜一切去争取了
I did whatever it took.

782
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,840
你什么都没做
You didn't do a thing.

783
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,580
只要你愿意做小人
You had the chance to triple our business,

784
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,860
就能把我们的生意扩大两倍
and all you had to do was take a knee.

785
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,860
那叫卑躬屈膝
You mean bend a knee.

786
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,970
是的  我就是指这个
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

787
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,910
可你就是一个傲慢自大的小男孩
But you're an arrogant little boy

788
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,230
宁愿赢也不愿识时务
who would rather win than get in line.

789
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,710
那路易又怎么识时务了
Well, what the hell did Louis do to get in line?

790
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,670
他付出了一切
He did whatever it took.

791
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,730
-请离我远点  -克莱尔  等等
- Please get away from me. - Claire, wait.

792
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,610
-纳森都告诉我了  -让我解释下  好吗
- Nathan told me everything. - Just let me explain, okay?

793
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,630
解释什么  你是反社会者吗
No, explain what-- that you're a sociopath?

794
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,820
我不是反社会者
I'm not a sociopath.

795
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,220
我是之前跟你很合得来的人啊
I'm the same guy that you hit it off with.

796
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,640
不  你不是  你骗了我
No, you're not. You lied to me.

797
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,650
不  我是  我并不是故意要骗你的
Yes, I am, and I didn't mean to lie to you, okay?

798
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,460
我本是打算告诉你事实的
I was gonna tell you the truth.

799
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,730
那你为什么不说呢
Then why didn't you?

800
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,070
因为你说你的理想型是个
Because you said you wanted to be with a guy

801
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,800
能好好生活  踏实做事的人
who was doing something good with his life, 

802
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,350
但我不是
and I wasn't.

803
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,190
那又怎样  你现在是来告诉我说突然之间
So what, now you're here to tell me that all of a sudden,

804
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,370
你就想投身于助人为乐的伟大事业了
you want to dedicate your life to helping people

805
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,730
还是又要撒其他的谎
or some other lie like that?

806
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,510
我没骗你  我本也能帮到海克特·苏雷兹的
It's not a lie, and what I did would have helped Hector Suarez.

807
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,010
是啊  但是你只是为了…
Yeah, but you only did it--

808
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,760
克莱尔  求你了  你得相信我
Claire, please, you have to believe me.

809
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,610
遇见你之后  我就打算要重新做人了
After I met you, I decided to get my shit together.

810
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,420
我正在努力重新开始
I am trying to get my shit together.

811
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,220
好了  迈克  你知道比起
Okay, Mike, you know what I hate more

812
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,240
生活一团糟  我更恨的是什么吗
than guys who don't have their shit together?

813
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,740
就是骗人说你在重新开始
It's guys who lie about getting their shit together.

814
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,580
克莱尔
Claire.

815
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,350
路易  加满油  我马上回来
Louis, fill up the tank. I'll be back.

816
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,320
动手吧
Well?

817
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,400
动什么手
Well, what?

818
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,390
你听到他说的了  加油啊
You heard what he said. Fill up the tank.

819
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,960
对  我的确听到了
Yeah, I did hear what he said.

820
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,680
他说的是  路易  把油加满
He said, "Louis, fill up the tank."

821
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,710
可是  在我们那儿  给车加油这种事
Well, where I come from, it's people who didn't go to college

822
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,750
是没上过大学的人干的
who fill up gas tanks.

823
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,110
嗯  可是在我们那儿
Yeah, and where I come from,

824
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,090
你要是再朝前走一步
if you take another step towards me--

825
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,950
噢  怎样  城里来的小霸王要揍我了吗
Oh, what, the tough kid from the city is gonna beat my ass?

826
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,490
路易  我再警告你一次
Louis, I'm telling you right now...

827
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,670
你毁了我的人生  你还毁了我的律所
You ruined my life. You ruined my firm.

828
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,860
路易
Louis!

829
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,160
贱人
You son of a bitch.

830
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,840
等等  哈维
Wait. Harvey--

831
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,300
现在就告诉我  不是你
Tell me right now you weren't the one

832
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,400
把我的计划透露给了弗莱彻引擎公司
that gave Fletcher Engines my game plan.

833
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,600
哈德曼跟我说  他本来就没想让你做合伙人
Hardman told me he wasn't gonna make you partner anyway.

834
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,360
他把这个机会给我  我只要
And once he offered it to me, all I had to do was--

835
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,710
出卖我
Sell me out.

836
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,540
我现在做的  跟你当初
How is what I did any different than you going after

837
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,090
争麦肯诺汽车公司时有什么区别
McKernon Motors in the first place?

838
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,420
如果你不能自己想明白  那你永远也不会懂
If you don't understand that on your own, you never will.

839
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,010
所以  从现在开始  你走你的阳关道
So, from now on, you stay on your side of the yard.

840
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,520
-我过我的独木桥  -哈维  听我说
- I'll stay on mine. - No, Harvey, listen to me.

841
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,430
你告诉过我只要你能获得地位
You told me you would fight to get our names on the wall

842
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,630
就会为我们的名字上墙而努力
once you got on the other side.

843
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,350
我也可以这样做
I can do the same for you.

844
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,700
你有听到我刚刚说的吗
Did you hear what I just said?

845
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,650
我不想要你为我做什么
I don't want you doing shit for me.

846
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,240
所以你做那个先成功的英雄
Oh, so it would be okay if you were the one

847
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,170
就没有问题了吗
who got there first?

848
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,030
要是你能先成功也可以啊
It would have been okay if you got there first

849
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,530
只要你光明正大
fair and square,

850
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,550
这样等你想跟我齐心协力的时候
because then I would have believed you

851
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,300
我才能相信你
when you said you wanted to be a team.

852
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,930
我的确想跟你齐心协力  哈维
I do want to be a team, Harvey.

853
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,290
所以之后我帮了你
That's why I helped you after.

854
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,880
你没有
No, you don't!

855
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,790
你不想组成团队
You don't want to be a team.

856
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,620
你是想鱼和熊掌兼得
You just want to have it both ways,

857
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,230
因为你是个不忠诚的叛徒
because you're a disloyal rat.

858
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,730
不管你门上贴了什么
You always have been, and you always will,

859
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,460
现在  将来  你都只是个叛徒
no matter what it says on your door.

860
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,040
就像你说的  我们从第一天起
Well, like you said, we've been pitted against each other

861
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,520
就已经是对手
since day one.

862
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,620
你问我当初一起的那50个初级律师
You asked how many of the 50 associates we started with

863
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,010
有多少会变成合伙人
would make partner.

864
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,560
其实  我一点也不在乎剩下的49个人
Well, you know what? I don't give a shit about the other 49,

865
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,140
因为我成为了合伙人
because I'm the one who did.

866
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,030
我  成为了合伙人
I'm the one who did.

867
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,650
现在请你滚远一点
And now get the hell out of my face,

868
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,100
我还有工作要做
because I have work to do.

869
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,160
你知道他是故意的吧
You know he did that on purpose, right?

870
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,180
故意什么
Did what on purpose?

871
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,090
他叫你去加油是因为他知道你会怎么做
He asked you to fill the tank because he knew what you'd do.

872
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,880
知道我会怎么做
Knew what I would do?

873
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,300
怎么不说他知道你会怎么做
What about what you would do?

874
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,850
那个他也知道
He knew that too.

875
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,340
路易
Louis...

876
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,090
你连对不起都没跟我说过
You never even said you were sorry.

877
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,520
对不起  路易
I am sorry, Louis.

878
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,870
很抱歉我骗了你
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

879
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,780
但我不是骗子  路易
I'm not a con man, Louis.

880
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,760
我跟你说的其他事都是真的
Every single other thing I ever told you was true.

881
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,210
想知道点
Want to know something that 

882
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,240
我自己都不敢承认的事吗
I've never even admitted to myself?

883
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,300
我没学开车跟我没上法学院
I never learned to drive for the same reason

884
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,970
背后的原因是一样的
I never went to law school.

885
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,960
因为我的双亲死于一场车祸
Both my parents were killed in a car accident.

886
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,040
从那之后  我再也不敢…
And ever since then, I've never been able to--

887
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,470
坐在方向盘前
Get behind the wheel.

888
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,340
后来哈维给我驾照  我也收了
And then Harvey gave me a license, and I took it.

889
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,250
你那时才11岁啊
You were 11 years old.

890
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,500
你肯定觉得很孤独
I mean, you must have felt so alone.

891
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,250
我以为你不相信我是个孤儿呢
I thought you said you didn't believe I was an orphan.

892
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,650
我查过
I looked it up.

893
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,770
一发现你没上过法学院我就忍不住去查了
I had to once I found out that you never went to law school.

894
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,180
你是说一发现我是个骗子么
You mean once you found out that I'm a fraud.

895
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,130
你不是骗子  迈克
You're not a fraud, Mike.

896
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,710
你只是没上过法学院罢了
You just never went to law school.

897
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,450
好啦  弗雷泽[拳击手]  给你葡萄味的
Okay, Frazier, you get a grape.

898
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,770
阿里  给你混合果味的
Ali, I got you a fruit punch.

899
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,250
你们俩和好了吗
You two work your shit out?

900
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,960
就当是了  那我们走吧
I'll take that as a yes. Let's get the hell out of here.

901
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,430
我不该骗她的
I should never have lied to her.

902
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,290
诶  去她的吧  兄弟
Oh, screw her, man.

903
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,800
要是她不喜欢你本来的样子
If she doesn't like you for who you are,

904
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,910
她就不值得拥有你
she doesn't deserve you.

905
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,790
这不是克莱尔的错  是我的错
It's not Claire's fault. It's mine.

906
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,110
我知道你很喜欢她
I know you were into her and everything,

907
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,340
但相信我
but trust me,

908
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,210
天涯何处无芳草
there are plenty of other fish in the sea.

909
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,290
你又不是先知
You don't know that.

910
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,910
就我而言  我不可能再遇到
For all you know, I'm never gonna meet

911
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,410
像她这样的女孩了
another girl like her again.

912
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,170
迈克…
Michael--

913
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,760
特雷弗  要是你想让我听
Trevor, if I'm gonna have to listen

914
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,900
你接下来要说的话
to whatever you're about to say,

915
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,500
那就得先给我来根大麻烟
I'm gonna need a joint first.

916
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,960
天呐  你不是要重新开始人生么
Come on, I thought you were trying to turn your life around.

917
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,390
我明天再重生吧
I'll turn my life around tomorrow.

918
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,460
今晚我还是个送信的  所以…
But tonight I'm a bike messenger, so...

919
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,040
-老兄  -特雷弗
- Dude-- - Trevor.

920
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,560
好吧
All right.

921
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,550
很好
Fine.

922
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,430
我知道奶奶不想让你住这里
And I know Grammy doesn't want you living here,

923
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,700
但你愿意的话  今晚可以留下
but you can crash here tonight if you want.

924
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,490
唐娜
Donna.

925
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,070
出了什么事吗
Something wrong?

926
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,750
为什么你会觉得出事了
Why would something be wrong?

927
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,420
因为我不记得你进过我办公室
Because I don't believe you've ever been in my office before.

928
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,030
没有  没出事
No, nothing's wrong.

929
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,880
我知道这话不该我来说
And I know it's not my place,

930
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,680
但我来告诉你  我觉得你犯了错误
but I'm here to tell you that I think you're making a mistake.

931
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,060
是因为哥伦比亚纪念日不放假的事吗
Is this about me not giving people off for Columbus Day?

932
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,100
你知道不是
You know this isn't about that.

933
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,630
哈维跟丹尼尔说了实话
Harvey laid it on the line with Daniel,

934
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,310
可你没有支持他
and you didn't have his back.

935
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,170
唐娜  从我认识哈维起就一直在支持他
Donna, I've had Harvey's back since the day I met him.

936
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:28,900
告诉你一声
For your information,

937
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,830
我一发现丹尼尔要做什么
when I found out what Daniel was up to,

938
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,500
就让他保证了合伙人选拔要公开
I had him guarantee partnership was on the table.

939
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,210
而之后你让他把那个位置给了错误的人
And then you let him give it to the wrong man.

940
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,070
那是哈维的问题  不是我的
That is on Harvey, not on me.

941
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,640
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

942
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,950
丹尼尔担心哈维不能
Daniel was worried that Harvey couldn't

943
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,540
把律所的利益置于他自身利益之上
put the firm's best interests ahead of his own,

944
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,620
哈维又证明了他顾虑得对
and Harvey proved him right.

945
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,320
也许只是你这么骗自己
Or maybe you're just telling yourself that

946
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,430
因为你不想跟丹尼尔·哈德曼对抗
because you don't want to stand up to Daniel Hardman.

947
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,960
唐娜  你在你的位置  我在我的位置
Donna, there's a reason why you are where you are

948
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,080
都是有道理的
and I am where I am,

949
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,550
因为我们中有个人能看到大局
and that is because one of us sees the bigger picture.

950
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,410
你知道弗莱彻引擎公司的事
You knew about Fletcher Engines?

951
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:08,340
我知道哈维的好日子会到的
What I know is that Harvey's time will come.

952
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,340
而如果这个小事件能让他考虑别人
And if this little incident gets him to think about other people

953
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,090
有点改变  我会接受的
for a change, then I'll take it.

954
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,370
你起得很早
You're up early.

955
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,900
我起得早是因为没睡着
I'm up early, because I couldn't sleep.

956
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,370
你一晚上去哪了
Where we you all night?

957
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,770
你知道我去哪了
You know where I was.

958
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,410
我在新公寓住
I was staying at my new apartment.

959
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,470
我以为我们已经决定好了
I thought we'd settled this.

960
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,790
你决定了  我还没有
You settled it. I didn't.

961
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,880
我跟你说  那个孩子...
I'm telling you, that kid--

962
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,500
奶奶  从我记事起
Grammy, for as long as I can remember,

963
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,880
你就一直叫他"那孩子"
you've been calling him "That kid"

964
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,080
"那小子"  有时更糟
or "That boy" or worse.

965
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,720
他叫特雷弗
His name is Trevor.

966
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,030
他是我最好的朋友
And he's my best friend.

967
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,020
无论你是否祝福我  我都要做这件事
Look, I'm gonna do this thing with or without your blessing,

968
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,900
但...
but...

969
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,000
有你的祝福更好
it sure would be nice to have it.

970
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,090
好吧  迈克
Okay, Michael.

971
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,140
我不会跟你说谎  假装同意
I'm not gonna lie to you and pretend I approve,

972
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,460
但...
but...

973
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,770
你是大人了  我尊重你的决定
you're a grown man, and I respect your decision.

974
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,580
我爱你  奶奶
I love you, Grammy.

975
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,180
我也爱你
I love you too.

976
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,610
谢谢你
Thank you.

977
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,420
我就需要了解这些
I believe that's all I need to know.

978
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,040
谢谢您花时间面试  皮尔逊女士
Thank you for your time, Ms. Pearson.

979
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,280
我会等您的回信
I will wait to hear from you.

980
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,500
还有一件事
Oh, one more thing--

981
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,130
你父亲知道你来找我求职吗
does your father know you came to me for a job?

982
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:57,750
我...
I-I--

983
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,800
你真以为我不知道
Did you really think I didn't know

984
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,760
你是罗伯特·赞恩的女儿吗
you were Robert Zane's daughter?

985
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,350
你是因为那个才面试我吗
Is that why you're interviewing me?

986
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,600
如果是的
Because if it is,

987
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,220
我希望我从备选名单上除名
I would like to remove myself from consideration.

988
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,100
你不想给你父亲工作
If you don't want to work for your father,

989
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,500
那是你的事
that's your business.

990
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,670
我雇你是因为我喜欢自己看到的特质
I'm hiring you because I like what I see.

991
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,130
雇我
Hiring me?

992
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,740
周一开始上班  如果没问题的话
You start Monday, if that's not too much trouble.

993
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,780
我会第一个来上班的
I will be the first one in.

994
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,740
你不问我为什么不想为我父亲工作吗
Aren't you gonna ask me why I don't want to work with my father?

995
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,910
我知道原因
I know why.

996
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,170
我有个跟你一样的父亲
I have a dad just like yours.

997
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,290
他也有自己的律所
He has his own law firm?

998
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,530
他是外科医生
He's a surgeon.

999
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,000
但其实是一样的
But it's the same damn thing.

1000
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,230
-时间准吗  -时间刚刚好
- How are we on time? - We're perfect.

1001
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,990
但我不进去了  你俩去
But I'm not going in there. You two are.

1002
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,250
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1003
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,220
我说过要把麦肯诺的一半业务给你
I said I was giving you 50% of McKernon.

1004
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,610
但没说我会保留另一半
I didn't say I was keeping the other 50%.

1005
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,130
你终于意识到他们的代理
Oh, so you finally realized they need an upgrade

1006
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,520
需要升级了
in representation.

1007
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,740
悠着点  弗雷泽
Easy, Frazier.

1008
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,560
要不是我救你
You'd still be out cold at that gas station

1009
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,790
你还在加油站冻着呢
if I hadn't saved your ass.

1010
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,030
我最终总能活着出去的...
Okay, I would have gotten out... eventually.

1011
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,090
-我看不会  -我很狡猾的
- Not from where I was standing. - I'm slippery.

1012
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,630
我说过  我在高中玩摔跤的
I told you-- I wrestled in high school.

1013
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,370
-我查过  他是玩过  -看见了吧
- I checked on that. He did. - See?

1014
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,840
现在你要帮他了
Oh, and now you're fighting for him?

1015
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,500
那我想这里没我事了
Okay, I guess my job here is done.

1016
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,750
等等  你去哪
Wait, where are you going?

1017
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,300
我把车开回城里去
I'm taking the car, back to the city.

1018
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,840
我们要怎么办
What the hell we suppose to do?

1019
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:32,180
雷在停车场那头等着呢  对吗
Ray is wating on the other side of the parking, isn't he?

1020
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,610
你们办完事  他载你们回去
He'll drive you two back when you're done

1021
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,610
等等  我有个更好的主意
Wait, you know, I have a better idea.

1022
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,590
你带走雷  我们开车
How about you take Ray, we take the car,

1023
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,510
回去路上我教迈克开车怎么样
and I'll teach Mike how to drive on the way home.

1024
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,240
你真愿意教我
You'd actually do that?

1025
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,310
愿意
Yeah, I would.

1026
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,320
坚决不行
