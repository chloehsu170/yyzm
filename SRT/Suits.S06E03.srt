{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on "Suits"...

15
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,950
我跟你没有任何过节
I don't have anything against you,

16
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,690
我当然不会为了一个陌生人
but I'm not gonna cause trouble with a guy like that

17
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,710
去招惹那样一个人
for someone I've never even met.

18
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,460
所以如果他想让我换几个小时的房间  那我就换
So if he wants me to switch for a few hours, I'm switching.

19
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,270
要是他在里面出了什么事
If something happens to him in there,

20
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,810
我绝对不会原谅你的
I will never forgive you.

21
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,800
-什么事  哈维  -帮我保护迈克・罗斯
- What do you want, Harvey? - Help me protect Mike Ross.

22
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,430
他和我抓的一个人被关在一起  那人可不是吃素的
He's in there with a guy I put away, and the guy is no joke.

23
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,560
但你要我做什么
What am I supposed to do?

24
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,810
我要你把那个人转到别的监狱
You're supposed to move the guy to another prison.

25
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,380
我们合作那么久的时间里
You got a lot of balls saying that to me

26
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,100
你一直都知道他是冒牌货
when the entire time we were working together,

27
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,410
居然还敢来跟我说这话
you knew the kid was a fraud.

28
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,160
我不需要你的原谅  肖恩
I don't need your forgiveness, Sean.

29
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,320
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

30
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,910
你想跟我一对一  来吧
You want me one-on-one, you got it.

31
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,050
我打算用这个  而他们会按住你
I'm gonna use this, and they're gonna hold you.

32
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,440
-不不不  -怎么回事
- No! - What's going on here?

33
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,410
你为什么带警卫一起回来
Why'd you come back with a guard?

34
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,830
我那么做不是为了让你原谅我
I didn't do it to get you to forgive me.

35
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,930
我当初就不该让他进来
I never should have let him in here in the first place.

36
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,070
我都还不知道你的名字
I don't even know your name.

37
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,430
凯文  凯文・米勒
Kevin. Kevin Miller.

38
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,480
路易  你的想法是对的
Louis, you have the right idea,

39
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,830
但方法错了
but the wrong execution.

40
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,700
如果我们想看起来像个律所
If we're going to look like a real firm,

41
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,240
我们需要把这些办公室转租出去
we need to do something about subletting these offices.

42
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,520
我会处理
I'll take care of it.

43
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,830
请问我的申请还有什么问题吗
So, is everything on my application in order?

44
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,420
-没有了  -那就好
- Yes, it is. - Good.

45
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,690
那样的话  就继续谈一些细节吧
Because in that case, I'd like to get down to the particulars.

46
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,860
别管那个申请了
Forget the application.

47
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,830
我需要知道你是一个什么样的人
I need to know what the hell kind of man you are.

48
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,540
什么意思
Excuse me?

49
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,880
你们公司的碳排放准则是什么
What's your firm's carbon footprint?

50
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,970
-路易  你又来了  -碳排放
- Louis, not again. - Carbon footprint?

51
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,200
-我们是一家律所  我为什么要  -天哪
- We're a law firm, why would I-- - Jesus Christ.

52
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,210
迈阿密还有五年就要被水淹了
Miami's gonna be underwater in five years,

53
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,580
你们却没有环保政策
and you don't have a goddamn green policy?

54
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,380
就这样吧  这次面试结束了
You know what? This interview's over.

55
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,500
面试  这不是租约谈判吗
Interview? This was supposed to be a lease negotiation.

56
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,040
带着你的说辞快滚吧
Tell your story walking, jerk-off.

57
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,230
天哪  路易
Goddamn it, Louis.

58
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,350
这已经是你
That is the fifth tenant

59
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,290
用一些扯淡话吓走的第五个租客了
you have scared away because of some bullshit.

60
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,610
-这不是扯淡  杰西卡  -真的吗
- This isn't bullshit, Jessica. - Really?

61
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,490
那你从什么时候开始在意环境
Since when do you care about the environment?

62
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,490
转基因黄瓜
Or genetically modified cucumbers?

63
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,520
又或是同性恋人群困境的呢
Or the plight of the LGBT community?

64
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,410
这都是我非常关心的话题
Those are legitimate causes close to my heart.

65
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,660
你这是在无理取闹
You're being ridiculous.

66
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,320
如果法国人能够再无理取闹一点
Yeah, well, had the French been more ridiculous,

67
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,450
那他们也不会
they wouldn't have the Nazis goose-stepping

68
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,770
被纳粹统治六年了
through their streets for six years.

69
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,540
你真的要拿这两件事做比较吗
Are you really comparing this to that?

70
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,470
我坚持这个观点
I stand by that statement.

71
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,800
那就也注意一下这件事
Then stand by this.

72
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,060
明天之前再找不到新的租客
You don't find a new tenant by tomorrow,

73
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,150
那你就自己掏租金吧
then the rent is coming out of your pocket.

74
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,510
所以以后我们在餐厅要一起吃饭吗
So do we eat together in the cafeteria from now on

75
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,810
还是有什么别的规矩
or how does that work?

76
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,820
你知道这里不是高中吧
You know this isn't high school, right?

77
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,900
我当然知道
Yeah, of course I know that.

78
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,170
但你还是会参加运动会的对吧
You are going to the pep rally, though, right?

79
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,270
说真的  迈克  加洛不会放过你的
Seriously, Mike, Gallo's not going to forget about you,

80
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,310
现在连我也算上了  也就是说
and now me, which means--

81
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,850
我们需要互相照应
We need to have each other's backs.

82
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,940
没错  所以现在开始我们不仅要一起吃饭
Exactly. So from now on, we don't just eat together,

83
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,940
还要尽可能的多呆在一起
we stick together as much as possible.

84
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,730
唯一比较难做到这一点的时间
The only time I see that being a problem

85
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,650
应该是下午两点到四点
is afternoons between 2:00 and 4:00.

86
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,720
我要在厨房工作
I took a job working in the kitchen.

87
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,410
那从今天开始  下午两点到四点的时间
Then starting from today, I'm gonna be doing something

88
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,890
我会尽量待在公共场合
very public from 2:00 to 4:00.

89
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,940
罗斯  你跟我来
Ross, you're coming with me.

90
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,460
怎么了  有什么事吗
Why, is there a problem?

91
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,950
不能说
That's not for me to say.

92
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,340
那我们要去哪
Well, where are we going?

93
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,900
心理咨询师要见你
The counselor wants to see you.

94
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,610
但我们正要去吃早餐呢伙计
Yeah, we're on our way to breakfast, man.

95
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,370
那你就给他留块饼干吧
Well, then you can save him a biscuit,

96
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,670
但他一定得跟我走
but he's coming with me.

97
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,310
走吧
Let's go.

98
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,270
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

99
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,560
我听说了你的事
I heard what happened.

100
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,170
所以你也知道杰西卡在犯浑了吗
So you know that Jessica was being an asshole?

101
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,540
我听说的是你见了五个租客
What I heard was that you interviewed five tenants,

102
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,300
然后找到了各种理由把他们拒绝了
and you found a way to turn them all down.

103
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,920
所以你不想说说到底怎么了吗
So why don't you tell me what the hell's going on?

104
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,230
一切都不好了
Everything's going on.

105
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,350
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

106
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,860
唐娜  这些租客在租办公室的时候
Donna, nobody's gonna be taking these offices

107
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,970
都会要这些大办公室
without taking the bullpen.

108
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,860
这是这块地方的灵魂所在
It's the heart and soul of this space.

109
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,380
这也是你的灵魂所在
And it's also the heart and soul of you.

110
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,500
正是  所以我不能容忍
Exactly, which is why I will not stand

111
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,570
另一个律所跑来用他们鱼龙混杂的小职员
for another firm to stick their promiscuous associates

112
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,900
玷污我纯洁的孵化间
in my innocent incubator.

113
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,160
好吧  我选择不回应这句  我只有一句话
Okay, I'm gonna choose not to respond to that except to say,

114
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,010
你有没有想过可以不出租办公室呢
did it ever occur to you to rent to someone without the bullpen?

115
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,200
唐娜  那不可能
Donna, that's never gonna happen.

116
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,810
可能
It could.

117
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,070
你只找了律师事务所
You've only been looking at law firms

118
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,430
而律所需要公共空间  但是...
and law firms need communal spaces, but--

119
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,990
其他公司则不需要  天呐
Other firms don't. Oh, my God.

120
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,330
我怎么就没想到
Why didn't I think of that?

121
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,170
我们可以做高净值人士的财务规划师
We can go with financial planners for high net worth individuals.

122
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,260
没错  他们很老派
That's it. They're old school.

123
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,820
他们的对话都很有教养
They have privileged conversations.

124
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,450
他们都是软蛋
They're pussies.

125
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,640
这句我也不回应了
Again, I'm not gonna engage.

126
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,200
最棒的一点在于他们都不精通法律
And best of all they're not legally savvy,

127
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,530
所以我可以把任何我想要的细则塞给他们
and I can shove any fine print down their throats that I want.

128
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,950
唐娜  你真是个天才
Donna, you're a genius.

129
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,230
我现在只需确保你不会再次搞砸面谈了
The only thing left for me to do is make sure you don't shit the bed in another interview.

130
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,680
你为什么觉得我就会搞砸
What makes you think I would do that?

131
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,160
根据我们的每一次对话  包括这一次
Every conversation we've ever had, including this one.

132
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,460
有理有据  去张罗吧
Fair point. Set it up.

133
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,250
你找我
You wanted to see me?

134
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,310
没错  也许你可以解释一下
Yes, and maybe you can explain

135
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,830
你为什么至今没有来找我
why you haven't come to see me yet.

136
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,210
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

137
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,840
我在说弗兰克・加洛
I'm talking about the fact that Frank Gallo

138
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,450
在公共区域对你亮刀子了
pulled a knife on you in the common area.

139
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,910
听着  我谢谢你的关心  但我没事
Look, I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.

140
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,980
没事
Fine?

141
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,860
迈克  你该庆幸他没有把你千刀万剐了
Mike, you are lucky he didn't cut you into a million pieces.

142
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,870
找不找你又有什么区别呢
What difference does it make?

143
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,030
我没来找你是因为你也无能为力
I didn't come to you because there's nothing you can do about it.

144
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,680
我是来帮你的
I'm here to help you.

145
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,270
没错  但你帮不了  不是吗
Yeah, but you can't, can you?

146
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,390
我告诉过你加洛买通了狱警了
Look, I already told you Gallo has guards in his pockets,

147
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,460
然后你告诉我你无权管理狱警
and you told me you have no authority over the guards.

148
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,650
那你可以提出正式的指控
Then file a formal allegation.

149
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,110
我不可能那样做
No way I am doing that.

150
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,400
听我说  你已经和这人起过两次冲突了
Listen to me, you have had two incidents with this man.

151
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,790
假如记录下来的话  就会有人来调查
Now, if it goes on record, it triggers an investigation.

152
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,490
然后这个地方的每个狱警和犯人
And then every single guard and inmate

153
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,930
都会知道我做过什么了
in this place will know what I did.

154
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,950
你是情愿在这里空做假设
And would you rather have a hypothetical problem

155
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,290
还是想处理你所面临的真正的
or deal with your real problem

156
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,780
不会自动消失的问题
that isn't going away by itself?

157
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,240
我想要的是不必在这两者间做出选择
What I'd like is to not have to choose either one.

158
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,050
你不知道我告诉你  兄弟
Well, I've got news for you, bro.

159
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,370
不管怎样
One way or another,

160
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,970
无论你喜不喜欢  你都必须做出选择
you're making that choice whether you like it or not.

161
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,590
你看起来没事
Well, you seem to be okay.

162
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,130
看来之前不是加洛在玩什么花招
I'm guessing that wasn't some trick by Gallo

163
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,090
想把我们分开
to split us up before?

164
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,330
嗯  不是
No, it wasn't.

165
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,230
那跟我说说那个心理咨询师想干什么
Then how about you tell me what that counselor wanted?

166
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,820
那不重要
It's not important.

167
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,440
我之前说我们不能抛下对方
Hey, when I said we can't leave each other alone,

168
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,080
其中也包括要信息共享
I meant information too,

169
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,420
他是不会无缘无故早上一起来就拦下你的
and he's not yanking you down there first thing in the morning for nothing.

170
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,770
这不重要  是因为我不会按他的意思做
It's not important because what he wanted, I'm not doing.

171
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,880
我明白了
I get it.

172
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,340
他想要你举报加洛  而你不信任我
He wanted you to inform on Gallo, and you don't trust me.

173
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,120
我不是不信任你
That's not true,

174
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,010
但我不准备做的事不必告诉你吧
but I don't have to tell you about every offer I get that I don't take.

175
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,540
对  没问题
Yeah, that's fine,

176
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,050
但我需要你明白他要你做的是什么
but I need you to understand what he's asking you to do,

177
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,660
因为假如你举报了加洛
because if you rat on Gallo,

178
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,370
这里就会只剩我一个人了
I'm gonna be left here by myself.

179
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,120
什么意思
What are you talking about?

180
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,170
我是指马克・辛吉斯
I'm talking about Mark Higgins.

181
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,990
我最初来这里时他是我的室友
He was my roommate when I first got here.

182
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,120
他被另外某个混蛋骚扰了
He was being harassed by some different asshole,

183
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,160
一周要挨打几次
taking a beating a couple times a week,

184
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,900
然后那个心理咨询师  朱利叶斯
and that counselor, Julius,

185
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,910
说服他去举报
convinced him to go on record.

186
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,960
两周后  他们直接把他打昏迷了
Two weeks later, they put him in a coma.

187
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,240
然后就再也没醒过来
He never came out.

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,100
所以你的意思是我不能相信朱利叶斯
So you're telling me that I can't trust Julius?

189
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,890
我只是说马克相信了他
I'm saying Mark did,

190
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,950
然后马克就不在这里了
and Mark's not here anymore.

191
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,320
哈维  你去哪了  杰西卡需要...
Harvey, where have you been? Jessica needs--

192
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,610
{\an8}迈克・罗斯  初级合伙人

193
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,670
唐娜  我需要你给肖恩・卡荷尔打电话
Donna, I need you to get Sean Cahill on the phone,

194
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,930
立刻马上
and I need it yesterday.

195
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,420
我知道你在担心迈克
I know you're worried about Mike,

196
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,920
但你总得让人家做事吧
but let the man do his job.

197
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,600
我不是不让他做事
I'm not stopping him from doing his job.

198
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,920
我是想让他做快点
I'm telling him to do it faster.

199
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,180
你想要我怎么做  哈维
What do you want me to do, Harvey?

200
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,180
我已经给他留了一堆言了...
I've left him a dozen messages--

201
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,240
那就再给他留一堆  与此同时
Then leave him a dozen more, and while you're at it,

202
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,160
在他给你回电前都不要离开你的位置
don't leave your desk until he calls back.

203
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,080
-我做不到  -为什么
- I can't do that. - Why the hell not?

204
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,670
因为我得确保路易今天不会再赶走租客了
Because I'm making sure that Louis doesn't blow it with another tenant today.

205
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,870
那就让瑞秋去做
Then get Rachel to do that.

206
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,740
哈维  瑞秋要上法学院
Harvey, Rachel has law school.

207
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,220
再说了  我也想做这件事
And besides that, this is something that I want to do.

208
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,460
唐娜  我不在乎路易和他的租客
Donna, I don't give a shit about Louis and his tenants.

209
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,670
可我在乎
Well, I do.

210
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,650
因为我们都说过我们会尽一切努力
Because we all said that we would give everything we had

211
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,580
带这里重回昔日盛景
to get this place back to where it was,

212
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,180
而此时此刻
and right now,

213
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,330
杰西卡正带着一个策划在会议室等你
Jessica has a prospect waiting for you in the conference room.

214
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,880
所以与其责备我和肖恩在花时间做事
So instead of coming down on me and Sean for doing our jobs,

215
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,680
你不如到会议室去做好你该做的
why don't you get over there and do yours?

216
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,020
原告确认了被告的身份  法官
The plaintiff ID'd the defendant, Your Honor.

217
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,390
这是一个一目了然的案子
It's an open and shut case.

218
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,930
并不尽然
No, it isn't,

219
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,510
因为我们不能忽视他作为证人的可信度
because his reliability as a witness can't be ignored.

220
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,590
你这是什么意思  他的视力很好
What are you talking about? His eyes work perfectly.

221
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,940
没错  他的嘴巴也同样厉害
Yes, and so does his mouth,

222
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,260
因为记录上显示
because as the record shows,

223
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,550
他有为了谋取和解而做虚假陈述的历史
he has a history of making false statements to extort settlements.

224
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,150
你不觉得这有点讽刺吗
Don't you think it's a little ironic,

225
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,890
你居然在伦理课上质疑别人的品格
you questioning someone's character in an ethics class?

226
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,660
你这么说是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

227
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,160
我想庭上知道那是什么意思
I think the court knows what it means.

228
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,610
但我认为  如果你想
And what I think is if you're trying

229
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,970
通过贬低我来得分
to disparage me to score some points,

230
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,850
那你至少应该有胆量明说出来
then you should have the guts to say what you mean.

231
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,820
所以  娜奥米  为什么我说出来就很讽刺
So, Naomi, how is it ironic coming from me?

232
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,660
好了  大家  我们暂停一下吧
Okay, everyone, why don't we take a quick break?

233
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,420
因为你未婚夫正因诈骗罪入狱两年
It's ironic because your fiancé

234
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,820
所以你说出来很讽刺
is currently serving a two-year sentence for fraud,

235
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,640
不论你怎么说  大家都知道你知情
and no matter what you say, everyone here knows you knew.

236
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,490
好了  今天就到这里
All right, that's enough for today.

237
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,420
但是  娜奥米  你要知道在陪审团眼中
But, Naomi, if you're gonna impugn another lawyer's character,

238
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,540
指摘对方律师的人品的律师
you should know that in the eyes of a jury,

239
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,740
也不是什么有人品的律师
it doesn't say great things about your own.

240
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,190
瑞秋  我能跟你谈谈吗
Rachel, can I speak to you for a minute?

241
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,520
不好意思  教授  我五分钟后有一门课
I'm sorry, professor, I have another class in five minutes.

242
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,170
有人说为求胜利就要不眠不休  并非如此
They say coffee's for closers, but it's not.

243
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,990
真的吗
Is that a fact?

244
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,340
真的  所以我两年前就戒了咖啡
Yeah, which is why I gave it up two years ago,

245
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,550
那东西害死人
because that shit'll kill you.

246
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,260
挑衅证监会也害死人
So will playing chicken with the SEC,

247
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,030
但你好像也没在乎啊
but you don't seem to have a problem with that.

248
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,010
你知道我是谁
You know who I am.

249
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,100
我还知道你即将面临指控
I also know you have an indictment on the horizon,

250
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,080
并在找新的律师
and you're looking for new representation

251
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,790
因为没有任何脑经正常的律师
because no lawyer in his right mind

252
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,770
会愿意沾上你
wants to touch you with a ten-foot pole.

253
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,210
如果你是这样跟大客户说话的
If that's how you talk to prospective clients,

254
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,350
那我对你也没什么兴趣了
maybe I don't want to get to know you better.

255
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,940
我觉得你有  因为你也找不到别人了
I think you do because you got nowhere else to go.

256
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,540
问题是  你为什么会认为我就会代理你
The question is, what makes you think I'd take you on?

257
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,640
天呐  我不知道
Gee, I don't know.

258
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,210
你怎么不问问你们那忙忙碌碌的
Why don't we ask one of the hundreds of associates

259
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,560
几百个律师呢
you have walking around here?

260
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,590
不对  你们这儿已经没有律师了
Oh, wait, you don't have any associates walking around here.

261
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,530
我理解了  你觉得我们现在绝望了
I get it -- you think we're down and desperate.

262
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,140
不  我认为你们挑衅律师协会
No, I think you played chicken with the ABA,

263
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,450
结果栽了跟头
came up short,

264
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,670
而现在你们需要一个高调的客户和一场大胜
and now you need a high-profile client and a big, goddamn win

265
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,890
否则不用多久你们就要流落街头了
or you're gonna be on the street in about ten minutes.

266
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,000
我需要的是立马把你从这里赶出去
What I need is to kick your ass out of here right the hell now

267
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,280
因为我对你这种客户不感兴趣
because I'm not interested in your kind of client.

268
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,280
好了  不开玩笑了
All right, fun time's over.

269
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,740
我会付一笔定金并给你三倍的价格
I'll pay you a retainer and triple your rate.

270
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,120
你就是付我五倍的价格
You can quintuple my rate.

271
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,470
我的答案也不会变
My answer's never gonna change.

272
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,320
听我说  我们这是完美合作
Listen to me. We are a perfect fit.

273
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,240
我需要  你也需要
I need this and you do too.

274
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,550
成功的话  我的生意在我有生之年都给你们
And it works out, my business is your firm's the rest of my life.

275
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,470
这正是我不想跟你合作的原因
That's exactly why I don't want it.

276
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,470
如果你不介意的话  我要享受我的咖啡了
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna enjoy my coffee.

277
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,760
我应该祝你在证监会好运  威廉
I'd wish you luck with your SEC troubles, William,

278
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,020
但就算说了也不是真心的
but I wouldn't mean it.

279
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,220
他人呢
Where is he?

280
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,360
他不在这里
He's not here.

281
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,010
什么叫他不在这里
What do you mean he's not here?

282
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,950
他去行使宪法第四章15节的权力了
I mean he's taking his 4:15 constitutional.

283
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,930
你是说他去厕所了
You mean he's in the bathroom.

284
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,910
我想应该是的
I believe that's the situation,

285
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,960
但是我更乐意告诉自己他出去散步了
but I prefer to tell myself he's out for a stroll.

286
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,300
我感觉自己重生了
I feel like a new man.

287
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,220
好像肩膀卸掉了一百磅的重量
Like a 100-pound load off my shoulders.

288
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,160
我想我们都知道那重量不是从肩膀上卸下的
I think we all know that's not where it came from.

289
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,710
真有趣  来吧  路易
Well, that was fun. Come on, Louis.

290
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,100
我们还有些会议要约呢
We've got some appointments to make.

291
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,170
不用了  我搞定了
No need. I took care of it.

292
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,650
-什么  -你以为我卸下的是什么重担
- What? - What do you think I meant by a load off my shoulders?

293
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,430
我签了新租客了
I signed the new tenant.

294
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,430
你自己签的
Without me?

295
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,420
对  我找到一个和善的老人
Well, yes. Listen, I found this sweet old man

296
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,970
他管着一些友好的基金经理
who runs a bunch of friendly money managers

297
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,060
打算扩大规模
looking to expand,

298
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,560
他们都看着像有一千岁了
and they're all, like, 1,000 years old.

299
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,210
他们甚至都不需要大办公室
They're not even gonna need the bullpen,

300
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,710
他们明天搬过来  一切都会很完美
and they start tomorrow, and it's gonna be perfect.

301
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,210
不  路易  不会完美的
No, Louis, it's not going to be perfect.

302
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,340
你在说些什么
What are you talking about?

303
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,970
我们说好了要一起解决这件事
We said we were gonna do this together,

304
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,390
我跟你一样是这个公司的一员
and I am a part of this firm as much as you are,

305
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,890
而当你这样不叫我就
and when you go ahead and you do something like this

306
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,830
单独行动  真的很让我生气
without me, it really pisses me off.

307
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,180
唐娜  对不起
Donna, I'm sorry.

308
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,520
我只是想向自己证明我不会搞砸
I just wanted to prove to myself that I could not screw this up.

309
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,870
那你搞砸的时候也别跑来找我
Well, don't come running to me when you do.

310
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,230
求求你告诉我
Oh, please tell me

311
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,530
你在做普通的土豆泥
you're making just plain old mashed potatoes.

312
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,030
我受够了他们一直给我们吃的
I am getting so sick of that au gratin bullshit

313
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,270
那些裹面包屑的垃圾
they keep serving us.

314
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,060
你怎么不去跟厨师说呢
Why don't you take it up with the cook?

315
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,930
那我就是想跟你反映怎么办
Well, what if I want to take it up with you?

316
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,240
那我就只能说你运气不好了
Well, I'd say you're shit out of luck

317
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,640
因为这不是我能决定的
because it is not my call.

318
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,850
事实上  我觉得能找到落单的你
Actually, I feel hip deep in luck

319
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,800
我是走了好运才对
finding you here all by yourself.

320
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,000
你不会在这里对我做什么的
You're not gonna do anything to me here.

321
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,720
这里闲杂人等太多
There's too many other people.

322
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,570
你知道  我刚来的时候
You know, when I first got here,

323
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,300
还没有高中毕业证
I didn't have a high school diploma.

324
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,850
真没想到
Surprise, surprise.

325
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,680
不知不觉我已经跟你一样是一个书呆子了
Before you know it I was a regular Poindexter just like you.

326
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,630
恭喜  你父母肯定很骄傲
Congratulations. Your parents must be so proud.

327
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,770
没错
They are.

328
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,300
我喜欢所有的科目  但最喜欢的是数学
I loved all my subjects, but math was my favorite,

329
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,250
尤其喜欢数学的传递属性
transitive property in particular.

330
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,780
加洛  我们讨论过这个话题了
Gallo, we've been over this.

331
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,270
你要通过我戳到哈维的点
You're gonna get to Harvey through me.

332
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,540
谢谢你  我知道了
Thank you. Got it.

333
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,960
没错  不过这才刚开始
That's true, but that's just the beginning,

334
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,720
因为如果我能通过你戳到哈维的点
because if I can get to Harvey through you,

335
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,850
也就是说我也能通过别人戳到你的点
that must mean I can get to you through somebody else.

336
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,190
你离凯文远点
You leave Kevin out of this.

337
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,790
现在有点晚了  迈克
A little late for that, Mike.

338
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,670
在这里我们实行狱友制
See, in here we use the buddy system.

339
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,500
可你让你的狱友落单了
You left your buddy alone.

340
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,070
你干了什么
What the hell did you do?

341
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,100
你自己去瞅瞅呗
Why don't you find out for yourself?

342
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,470
他在厕所  我建议你动作快点
He's in the bathroom. I'd hurry if I were you.

343
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,510
他坚持不了多久了
He's not gonna be conscious much longer.

344
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,240
凯文
Kevin.

345
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,760
发生了什么
Hey, what happened?

346
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,450
我很想说对方比我还惨
I'd say you should see the other guy, Mike,

347
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,170
但是对方有三个人我也没辙
but there were three of them.

348
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,080
来  起来
Oh, come on, hey, get up.

349
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,330
你不是说要待在公共场合的吗
I thought you said you were gonna stay in the open.

350
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,900
人有三急
Everyone needs to go to the bathroom,

351
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,420
加洛和他的狱友已经恭候多时了
and Gallo and his buddies were waiting for me when I got here.

352
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,680
走  我带你去医务室
Come on, we got to get you to the infirmary.

353
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,440
-不行  -你需要医生给你看看
- No, no! We can't. - You need someone to look at you.

354
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,630
我们不能去
We can't!

355
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,400
这正是加洛希望的
That's exactly what Gallo wants.

356
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,340
因为如果我们去了医务室
Because if we go to the infirmary,

357
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,820
我们就必须要提交报告
we're gonna have to file a report.

358
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,660
没错  然后他就不用亲自动手了
Yeah, and then he won't have to lay a finger on us

359
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,580
因为别人会替他动手
because someone else will do it for him.

360
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,800
我们怎么办
What are we gonna do?

361
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,370
我们只能
The only thing we can do.

362
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,870
忍气吞声
Suck it up and take it

363
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,220
直到加洛自己换攻击目标
until Gallo gets someone else in his sights.

364
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,380
哥们  我不管那些傻逼说了什么
Dude, I don't give a shit what those douches say.

365
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,410
那些股票都不值他们的那堆卫生巾
Those shares aren't worth the tampons they're printed on.

366
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,280
几楼
what floor?

367
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,800
告诉他们把那玩意塞屁眼里吧
Tell them to stick it in their ass.

368
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,970
我在打电话  哥们
I'm on the phone, guy.

369
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,970
我知道  但是...
I know. I understand that, but--

370
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,210
皮-斯-利律所  你和我们公司有什么业务
Pearson Specter Litt. What business do you have with our--

371
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,300
天哪  玩蛋去吧
Oh, Jesus Christ. Lick my balls.

372
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,510
你刚才对我说了什么
What did you just say to me?

373
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,960
等等  火箭车
Hold on, Skidmarks.

374
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,280
[西班牙语]我打电话呢  哥们  懂不
En el telefono, hombre. Comprende?

375
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,350
好了  兄弟  我得挂了
All right, man, I got to jet.

376
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,290
我们今天搬到新地方了
We're settling into our new digs today.

377
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,170
回头再聊  扫把星
All right, later, Brosef Stalin.

378
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,420
对不起
Excuse me.

379
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,620
我无意偷听
I couldn't help but overhear.

380
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,000
但这里肯定是有什么误会
There must be some mistake.

381
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,100
我们是租给了史蒂芬投资集团的
We're leasing space to the satellite division

382
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,540
卫星部门
of the Stevens Investment Group.

383
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,150
就是我  斯图・布齐尼  我管卫星部门
That's me, pal, Stu Buzzini. I run the satellite division.

384
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,520
我见你老板的时候可不是这么说的
Well, that wasn't made clear to me when I met your boss.

385
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,370
那个老家伙
Old man river?

386
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,010
他不会天天来的
He's not gonna drag his ass in here every day.

387
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,470
他都快要见上帝了
He's got one foot in the grave.

388
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,710
那他给你看租赁合同了吗
Well, then, did he share with you the lease agreement?

389
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,620
因为上面写明了着装规定
Because it clearly outlined a dress code.

390
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,770
你以为我穿这个工作
You think I wear this to work?

391
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,680
你以为我是猪吗
What am I, an asshole?

392
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,840
你再见到我  我就穿西装了
Next time you see me I'll be in a suit

393
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,510
而且价钱是你这套的三倍多
three times more expensive than yours.

394
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,230
-这是布莱奥尼  -我看这是屎莱奥尼
- This is a Brioni. - It's a Bri-shitty, as far as I'm concerned.

395
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,770
来吧  哥们  碰一个
Come on, buddy, give me some.

396
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,110
拜托兄弟  别让我一人举着
Come on, brah, don't leave me hanging.

397
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,450
-什么  我不... -这才是我的姑娘
- Wha--I don't-- - Bssh. That's my girl.

398
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,580
我开玩笑的
I'm just kidding, Sally.

399
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,070
有问题就找我  好吗
holler at me if you need anything, okay?

400
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,960
我期待着我们成为损友
I'm looking forward to being douche-mates.

401
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,480
搅屎棍  昨晚拿到那个姑娘的电话了
Shit Stick, huh, you get that girl's number last night?

402
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,490
这就对了
That's right.

403
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,770
大蛋蛋  你怎么找到我们的
Ball Sack, how did you track us down, man?

404
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,100
我们不是把你开除了吗
I thought we fired you.

405
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,950
我了个去  我干了些什么
Holy goddamn shit, what have I done?

406
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,680
走  兄弟们  捞钱去
Come on, boys, let's make some money!

407
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,480
-唐娜  听我说  -我知道
- Donna, listen to me. - I know.

408
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,190
那你知道我...
Then you know that I--

409
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,800
像以前一样搞了一团糟
Shit the bed like you never have before?

410
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,170
-我很...  -出糗了
- I am so-- - Banged the monkey?

411
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:39,900
搬起石头砸自己的脚了
Screwed the pooch?

412
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,220
-唐娜  拜托  -作茧自缚了
- Donna, please-- - Flinked the flank?

413
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,070
那是什么意思
What does flink the flank mean?

414
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,990
意思是我还没嘲笑够你
It means I'm not finished enjoying this.

415
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,900
你什么时候能结束
When do you think you'll be finished?

416
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,220
因为我想知道要怎么办
Because I need to know what to do.

417
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,860
我不知道  租期什么时候结束
I don't know. When does their lease expire?

418
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,110
天哪  我给他们了一个延期选择
Oh, my God, I cooked in an extension option!

419
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,110
路易  放心
Louis, relax.

420
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,160
最重要的是要记住
The important thing to remember here

421
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,240
这就是你不听我话的下场
is that this is your fault for not listening to me.

422
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,360
这有什么用
How does that help me?

423
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,570
对你没用  但对我有用
It doesn't. It helps me.

424
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,600
-唐娜  -好吧  听我说
- Donna! - Okay, listen to me.

425
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,800
如果你真的要我帮忙  我会帮你的
If you really want my help, I'm gonna give it to you.

426
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,770
在接下来的24小时的某一刻
What's gonna happen is,

427
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,590
会发生一件只会戳到你的点的
sometime in the next 24 hours, a minor incident

428
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,030
芝麻大的小事
that would mean nothing to anybody else but you

429
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,250
会让你想终止这场惨剧
is gonna make you want to undo this fiasco.

430
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,440
我现在就想终止
I want to undo it right now.

431
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,730
但我正在告诉你不能这么做
But I'm telling you not to

432
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,670
因为除了会雪上加霜以外
because in addition to making things worse,

433
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,100
杰西卡还会弄死你
Jessica will kill you.

434
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,810
所以就先等等看吧  然后在
So just wait things out and in another--

435
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,630
抱歉  他们的租约什么时候到期来着
I'm sorry, when does their lease expire again?

436
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,420
-还有18个月  -18个月之后
- 18 months. - 18 months...

437
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,250
这整件事就会成为一段逝去的遥远回忆了
this whole thing will be a distant memory.

438
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,720
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

439
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,510
你能让它随风飘逝吗
Can you let it go?

440
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,190
是的  我觉得你可以
Yes, I think you can.

441
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,910
你能做到的
You can do it.

442
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,240
是的  我能
Yes, I can.

443
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,570
那就勇往直前去征服世界吧
Then go forth and conquer.

444
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,680
我估计他最多撑一个半小时
I'm gonna give him about an hour and a half.

445
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,660
杰西卡  有什么可以效劳的吗
Jessica, what can I do for you?

446
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,100
什么事让你这么开心
What are you so happy about?

447
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,200
我刚看到了我们的新租客
I just saw our new tenants.

448
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,820
一帮蠢货交易员
A bunch of dickhead traders.

449
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,470
他们会把路易逼疯的
They're gonna drive Louis crazy.

450
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,450
我刚接到一通非常有意思的电话
Well, I just got a very interesting phone call,

451
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,110
而我听了一点都笑不出来
but I'm not smiling about it.

452
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,470
尼日利亚王子把他的遗产留给了你吗
Nigerian prince leaving you his inheritance?

453
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,170
你不知道我告诉你  这是个骗局
Because I got news for you, it's a scam.

454
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,360
我也希望这是个骗局
I hope it's a scam

455
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,060
因为我刚听说你拒绝了一位
because I just heard you turned down a client

456
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,460
旗下投资机构价值20亿美元的客户
whose investment firm is worth $2 billion.

457
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,110
我才不在乎它们价值多少
Well, I don't give a shit how much they're worth.

458
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,750
我是不会为威廉・萨特辩护的
I'm not representing William Sutter.

459
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,690
是的  你会的
Oh, yes, you are,

460
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,650
除非你和我说清楚为什么不愿意这么做
or you're gonna give me a hell of a reason why not.

461
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,900
你想知道原因吗
You want the reason?

462
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,400
和这家伙比起来麦道夫和傅滋曼就跟圣徒一样
This guy makes Madoff and Forstman look like saints,

463
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,750
而我绝不要再和另一位罪犯产生联系
and I'm not getting involved with another criminal.

464
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,140
哈维  我觉得你不明白这里现在的状况
Harvey, I don't think you understand what's going on here.

465
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,970
我们现在用转租的租户来填满这些办公室
We're filling up these offices with subletters

466
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,930
好让外人看起来我们还在正常运作
to make it look like we're still alive,

467
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,810
但如果我们再不找到一个新客户
but if we don't land a new client

468
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,390
来告诉全世界我们王者归来了
and show the world that we're back,

469
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,750
那还不如直接把地方卖给他们算了
then we may as well let them have the space for good.

470
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,470
那你让我找找别人
Then let me land someone else.

471
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,000
最好是个大客户
Well, then it better be someone huge,

472
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,160
而且你最好在48小时内找到
and you better do it in the next 48 hours

473
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,770
因为那是我约萨特下一次会面的时间
because that's when I set our next appointment with Sutter,

474
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,850
那时你要还没找到  我们就把萨特签下来
and when we get there, we're signing him as a client.

475
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,150
你知道该去找谁  对不对
You know who you have to go to, right?

476
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,240
唐娜  没可能  他不行
Donna, no way. Not him.

477
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,340
哈维  你听到杰西卡说的话了
Harvey, you heard Jessica.

478
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,400
我们现在处境艰难  你也清楚
We're in trouble, and you know it,

479
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,210
而且南森・巴恩斯不是个罪犯
and Nathan Burns isn't a criminal.

480
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,720
他只是个混蛋而已
He's just an asshole.

481
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,440
一个我说过绝对不会与之合作的混蛋
An asshole I told I'd never get into business with.

482
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,350
那可真是太糟了
Well, that's too bad

483
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,700
因为我看到杰西卡往你办公室
because I set up a meeting with him

484
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,200
走的时候就立马帮你约了和他会面
the second I saw Jessica heading for your office.

485
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,470
迈克  我现在不方便跟你谈话
Mike, I can't talk right now.

486
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,180
有位犯人大约5分钟内会过来见我
I have an inmate coming in in about five minutes.

487
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,030
很好  因为我这些话大概只需要5秒钟
Good, because this will take about five seconds.

488
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,850
你得把加洛弄到别的关押区去
You need to get Gallo transferred to another block,

489
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,510
而且你必须立刻就做
and you need to do it right now.

490
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,700
先冷静一下  告诉我发生了什么事
Calm down and tell me what happened.

491
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,750
我很冷静
I am calm.

492
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,190
他在我工作时袭击了我的狱友
He attacked my cellmate while I was working.

493
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,240
这是间巨大的监狱
Now, this is a huge prison.

494
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,500
你把他给我弄走
You get him goddamn moved.

495
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,730
我没有这么做的权限
I don't have the authority to do that.

496
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,200
这是本周第二次你在告诉我
That's the second time this week you told me

497
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,870
你可以帮我后又和我说你不能帮我了
you can't help me after telling me you can help me.

498
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,970
-迈克  听着  -还有别再叫我
- Mike, listen-- - And don't tell me

499
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,210
提出正式指控了
to make a formal allegation again

500
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,210
因为那么做只会让事情变得更糟
because that is just going to make this worse.

501
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,310
没必要非得这样
It doesn't have to.

502
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,070
你是不是也这么告诉马克・辛吉斯的
Is that what you told Mark Higgins?

503
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,890
你这样就太过分了
That's out of line.

504
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,610
你怎么敢问我和其他犯人
How dare you ask me about discussions

505
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,330
之间讨论的谈话内容
I've had with another inmate.

506
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,180
据我所知
From what I understand,

507
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,370
他已经没法再和任何人讨论和谈话了
he can't have discussions with anyone anymore.

508
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,810
我也不想听他出了什么事
And I don't want to hear what happened to him.

509
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,170
我只想弄明白如何才能活着从这里出去
I just want to figure out how to get out of here alive.

510
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,210
如果你一直这么跟我说话
Well, I can't help you do that

511
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,000
我也没法帮你
if you keep talking to me like that.

512
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,360
听我说  朱利叶斯  我很抱歉
Listen to me, Julius, I'm sorry,

513
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,590
但我不能告发加洛
but I cannot tell on Gallo.

514
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,450
所以如果你没法把他转移走的话
So if you can't get him moved,

515
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,050
我得辞去我现在的工作
I need to quit my job,

516
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,890
因为凯文是我在这里唯一的朋友
because Kevin is my only friend in here.

517
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,790
我工作的话他一天就有两小时落单
That's two hours a day that he's exposed.

518
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,630
我不会再丢下他一个人了
I'm not gonna leave him alone again.

519
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,820
迈克  我很不想一直拒绝你
Mike, I hate to keep telling you no,

520
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,470
但在这里事情不是这么运作的
but that's not how it works in here.

521
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,690
什么不是这么运作的
How what works in here?

522
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,710
你不能随随便便就辞职
You can't just walk away from a job,

523
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,590
而且在这件事情上我也无能为力
and there's nothing I can do about that.

524
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,490
哈维・斯佩克特  真是没想到
Harvey Specter, as I live and breathe.

525
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,530
很高兴见到你  南森
Good to see you, Nathan.

526
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,580
不  并不高兴
No, it's not.

527
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,440
我一直在想在你的律师们都离开之后
I was wondering how long it would take after your lawyers left

528
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,280
要多久你才会来求我救你于水火之中
before you came here begging me to take you on.

529
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,440
我看起来像是过来求你的吗
Do I look like I'm begging?

530
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,160
实话说
To tell you the truth,

531
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,960
我以为你能撑到下周呢
I didn't expect you until next week.

532
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,150
绝望真是个好东西
You know, desperation's a beautiful thing.

533
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,820
好吧  你说得对
Okay, you got me.

534
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,680
那你是想一直这么拿这事恶心我呢
The question is, do you want to keep sticking it to me

535
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,720
还是要接受我这个仅此一次的提案
or do you want to take my one-time-only offer

536
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,700
成为我的头号客户
to become my number one client?

537
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,140
好吧  哈维  我也不想再给你添堵了
Okay, Harvey, I'm done sticking it to you,

538
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,660
如果你想拿到我这个客户  就得争取
if you want my business, you'll have to earn it.

539
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,100
不然你认为这些尼克斯前排票是来干嘛的
What do you think these front row Knicks tickets are for?

540
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,930
很好  我会给我的继子
Great. I'll give them to my stepson

541
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,640
因为他蠢得没边都不知道尼克斯烂死了
because he's too stupid to know the Knicks suck.

542
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,300
-你到底想要什么  纳森  -洛克伍德能源公司
- What do you want, Nathan? - Lockwood Energy.

543
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,740
他们十年来一直都是我的眼中钉
They've been a pain in my ass for ten years.

544
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,110
现在他们竟然想把生意做进我的后院
Now they're trying to bring their business to my backyard.

545
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,460
你想让我阻止他们
And you want me to block them?

546
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,590
我想让你拿着一堆的限制令塞进他们的菊花
I want you to shove so many restraining orders up their ass

547
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,010
让他们痛到无法呼吸
they can't even breathe,

548
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,410
而且我希望你能在今晚我们在本身餐厅
and I want it done by the time we sit down

549
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,380
吃开胃菜前  就搞定它
for appetizers tonight at Per Se.

550
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,870
那下次你见到我时
Then the next time you see me,

551
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,020
他们就会变得像你后视镜里的一小颗污点一样
they'll be a speck in your rear view mirror.

552
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,820
不过纳森  当我到餐厅的时候
But, Nathan, when I get there,

553
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,820
你最好手里拿着一杯威士忌等着我
you better have a Scotch waiting for me.

554
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,070
你打电话预定餐位时
You can order one for both of us

555
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,180
可以帮我们两人都预定一杯
when you call and make the reservations.

556
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,070
晚上八点  准时到
8 P.M. Sharp.

557
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,770
还有  哈维
and Harvey?

558
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,880
如果你不打电话亲自预定  我会知道的
If you don't call yourself, I'll know.

559
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,280
你真是个混蛋  纳森
You really are a dick, Nathan.

560
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,670
我是没错  但凡是我许下的承诺
I am, but when I give my word,

561
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,270
我决不食言
the world knows that it's rock solid.

562
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,830
所以  记得准时到
So, be there on time,

563
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,210
把事情办好
get that shit done,

564
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,120
不然就别露面了
or don't bother showing up at all.

565
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,830
西梅汁啊西梅汁啊  你真甜
Prune juice, prune juice you are so sweet

566
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,230
我全心全意爱着你
I love you all the way from my head down to my--

567
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,600
该死的
Goddamn it!

568
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,710
伙计  你能帮我做什么
Hey, guy, what can you do for me?

569
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,310
我的名字不是伙计  是路易
The name isn't Guy, it's Louis,

570
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,320
我在冰箱里放了
and I had a two-gallon bottle of

571
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
两加仑的西梅汁
prune juice in the refrigerator.

572
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,850
我想知道它去哪了
I want to know where it went.

573
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,390
没问题  我把那玩意扔掉了
No problem. I had to toss that shit.

574
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,840
你扔掉了我的西梅汁
You threw away my prune juice?

575
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,030
让我这样说吧
Let me put it this way,

576
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,740
如果我的菊花里再长一个菊花
if my asshole had an asshole,

577
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,820
那它闻起来就和你那瓶玩意一样
that's what it would smell like.

578
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,170
西梅汁就是这种味道
That's what it's supposed to smell like.

579
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,590
放轻松  哥们  不就是一瓶西梅汁嘛
Take it easy, bro, it's just prune juice.

580
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,090
不  这不仅仅是西梅汁的问题
No, it isn't just prune juice.

581
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,890
这事关我的厨房的神圣性
It's the sanctity of my kitchen.

582
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,120
除了我的西梅汁外  
And on top of my prune juice,

583
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,520
你还吃光了我所有的麦麸棒
you ate all of my bran bars.

584
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,960
你一定严重便秘吧
You must spend a lot of time on the shitter.

585
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,070
这和这次谈话没有关系
That's neither here nor there.

586
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,260
你违反了租约里的第三章C条款
You, sir, are in violation of subsection 3-C of your lease,

587
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,060
这意味着如果你再侵犯我的厨房
which means if it happens again,

588
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,100
你就可以滚蛋了
you're out on your ass.

589
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,060
什么
What?

590
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,410
什么样的混蛋才会把麦麸棒和西梅汁
What kind of dildo puts bran bars and prune juice

591
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,690
放进租赁合同里
in a lease agreement?

592
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,130
这个混蛋  就是站在这里的混蛋
This dildo. This dildo right here.

593
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,640
你疯了吗
Are you nuts?

594
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,800
不  我会成为你最怕的噩梦
No. I'm your worst nightmare,

595
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,130
因为我这个生气到颤抖的混蛋绝不会罢休
because this quivering angry dildo isn't going away

596
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,970
直到我满意为止
until it gets its satisfaction.

597
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,880
你刚刚和我说了什么
What did you just say to me?

598
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,180
我刚刚说
I just said,

599
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,710
如我再发现你违反了租赁合同
this dildo is gonna be in your face slapping it around,

600
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,620
我就会狠狠地扇着你的小脸
then up your ass marching you right out the door

601
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,150
然后拎着你的屁股让你滚出公司
if it catches you in violation of your lease ever again.

602
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,920
你好
Hello?

603
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,150
瑞秋  我是邓巴教授
Rachel, it's Professor Dunbar.

604
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,510
有什么能帮您的吗  教授
How can I help you, Professor?

605
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,290
我本想在课堂结束之后找你谈这件事
I tried to talk to you about this after class,

606
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,910
但我在想你是否对
but I was wondering if you'd be interested in helping me

607
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,970
帮我做一件我一直很关心的事
with something that's near and dear to my heart.

608
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,410
-什么事  -无罪计划
- What's that? - The Innocence Project.

609
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,820
你想让我帮你让无辜的人摆脱死刑
You want me to help you get an innocent man off death row?

610
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,290
这正是我想要的
That's exactly what I want.

611
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,410
这不会和今天在课上
This wouldn't have anything to do with the incident

612
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,130
发生的小插曲有关吧
after class the other day, would it?

613
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,570
你为什么这么说
What makes you say that?

614
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,420
因为我没有精力同时去应付两件事
Because I can't do both of these things at the same time,

615
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,830
你知道的
and you know it.

616
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,960
没错
Okay, yes.

617
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,130
我想你可能需要一些方式来缓解
Yes, I thought you might need a little relief,

618
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,370
但如果我觉得你不能胜任
but I wouldn't be offering you this

619
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,050
我是不会向你提出的
if I didn't think you'd earned it.

620
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,640
非常感谢  教授  只是
I appreciate that, Professor, just...

621
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,090
我不会就此退缩的
I'm not one to back away from a fight.

622
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,620
瑞秋  我不是要你退缩
Rachel, I'm not asking you to back away from a fight.

623
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,440
我是想让你专注于做更重要的事
I'm asking you to pick one that's more important.

624
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,400
-怎么样  -什么怎么样
- Well? - Well, what?

625
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,350
你乖乖地去打给本身餐厅预约了吗
Did you grovel to Per Se to get yourself a reservation?

626
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,700
我没有乖乖地去打给本身餐厅  
I didn't grovel to Per Se.

627
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,510
我乖乖地去找纳森了
I groveled to Nathan.

628
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,910
但我不想聊我都做了什么
But I don't want to talk about what I did.

629
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,270
我想聊聊你做了什么
I want to talk about what you did,

630
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,170
因为如果你没有提交动议
because if you didn't file those motions

631
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,030
那么我就可以直接取消晚餐预约了
then I might as well cancel dinner.

632
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,320
我不仅提交动议了
I didn't just get them filed,

633
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,070
我还让市检察官把这些动议放在了最前面
I got the city attorney to put them on the top of the pile.

634
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,810
限制令  专利侵权诉讼
Restraining order, patent infringement suit,

635
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,170
侵权干扰和环境危害报告
tortious interference, and environmental hazard report.

636
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,830
洛克伍德会被打懵圈的
Lockwood isn't gonna know what hit them.

637
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,090
好吧  与其在这里洋洋得意
Well, instead of patting yourself on the back,

638
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,170
为什么你不拿起电话让肖恩・卡荷尔来见我
why don't you pick up the phone and get me Sean Cahill?

639
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,970
她不需要打给肖恩・卡荷尔
she doesn't have to get you Sean Cahill,

640
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,290
因为他就站在你面前
'cause he's standing right in front of ya.

641
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,080
你终于来了
It's about time.

642
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,300
为什么你不回我的电话
Why the hell haven't you returned any of my phone calls?

643
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,630
哈维  我需要你坐下
Harvey, I need you to sit down.

644
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,300
肖恩  为什么拖这么久
Sean, what took so long?

645
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,210
我花了好长时间才发现
It took me so long to find out

646
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,470
弗兰克・加洛哪也不会去
that Frank Gallo's not going anywhere

647
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,680
因为上面有人
because he's got people up in high places

648
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,040
在罩着他
who are protecting him.

649
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,670
告诉是谁在罩着他  我来搞定他们
Then tell me who they are. I'll put them in the ground.

650
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,340
-没那么容易  -对我来说很容易
- Look, it's not that simple. - It is to me.

651
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,730
哈维  你也许不明白
Harvey, you don't understand.

652
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,580
我知道除非他是政府的线人
I understand that unless he's a government informant,

653
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,880
我们就肯定能把他赶回原来的监狱去
we can get a criminal put back where he belongs.

654
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,710
你肯定是在逗我
You got to be kidding me.

655
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,530
我不能泄露联邦调查的内幕
Look, I can't reveal details of a federal investigation.

656
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,960
你无需泄露  我已经知道了
You don't have to. You just did.

657
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,600
你要去哪
Where are you going?

658
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,190
我要去告诉迈克这是怎么回事
I'm telling Mike what the hell's going on.

659
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,420
站住  听我说
Stop. Just listen to me.

660
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,220
不能让别人知道这消息是我泄露的
No one can know that this came from me.

661
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,210
肯定不会有人知道...
No one's gonna know about it at all...

662
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,320
除了迈克
except Mike.

663
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,960
哈维  如果你现在去监狱
Harvey, if you go to that prison now,

664
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,160
你肯定来不及赶回来
you'll never make it back in time

665
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,100
和纳森吃晚饭了
for your dinner with Nathan.

666
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,010
唐娜  我不管你用什么办法
Donna, I don't care what you have to do.

667
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,820
告诉他我会晚到一小时
Get him a message that I'll be an hour late,

668
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,290
并要保证他能同意
and make sure he says it's okay.

669
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,550
-哈维  -搞定这件事
- Harvey-- - Take care of it.

670
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,470
我不能让一无所知的迈克
I'm not leaving Mike alone in there another minute

671
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,110
一个人待在那
without knowing what's coming.

672
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,680
哈维
Harvey.

673
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,570
迈克
Mike.

674
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,110
希望你是带着搞定加洛的好消息来的
Please tell me you came here with good news about Gallo.

675
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,090
我是有消息  但不是好消息
I have news, but it isn't good.

676
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,550
该死
Oh, shit.

677
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,790
迈克  听我说
Mike, listen to me.

678
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,390
卡荷尔乐意帮忙  但他能力有限
Cahill wants to help, but his hands are tied.

679
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,680
这话是什么意思
What the hell does that mean?

680
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,370
加洛转到这来不是因为表现良好
Gallo's not here because of good behavior.

681
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,000
他来是因为他达成了协议
He's here because he cut a deal.

682
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,150
开什么玩笑  他是个线人
You got to be kidding me. He's a goddamn informant?

683
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:36,660
是的
Yeah.

684
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,510
这下好了  他不会离开这里了
Oh, that's great. So he's not going anywhere,

685
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,130
我也走不了了  除非是死了被人抬出去
and neither am I unless it's in a goddamn body bag!

686
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,490
迈克  我会再想别的办法
Mike, I'm gonna find another way.

687
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,710
谢谢你  哈维
I'd appreciate that, Harvey,

688
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,960
但眼下我该怎么办
but what the hell am I supposed to do in the meantime?

689
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,200
你一开始根本不想
You didn't even want me to try

690
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,310
让我插手把他弄走
and get him out in the first place.

691
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,260
可一开始我也没让你
And I sure as hell didn't ask you

692
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,650
把他弄进监狱啊
to put him in here in the first place.

693
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,620
你还建议我跟人拉帮结伙
And all the advice you gave me to stay in a group did

694
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,240
可到头来我在这监狱里唯一的朋友
was get the only friend I have in here

695
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,850
被人揍得差点送进医院
nearly put in the hospital.

696
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,990
我现在只剩下唯一一个办法了
Look, there's only one other thing I can think of,

697
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,400
但你一定要妥善处理
but you'll have to play it just right

698
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,010
不然情况就会变得更糟
or we're gonna make things worse.

699
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,550
那就告诉我吧
Well, you might as well say it,

700
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,520
不过在我看来
because from where I'm standing,

701
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,830
不管你说不说  情况都好不到哪去
they are gonna get worse whether you tell me or not.

702
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,960
能跟你谈谈吗  路易
Louis, can I talk to you for a second?

703
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,130
这回怎么不喊"哥们"
What, no brah?

704
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,910
"蛋蛋"和"大鼻子"了
No scrotum? No dick nose?

705
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,730
不了  还是叫你路易好了
No, man, just plain old Louis.

706
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,640
我觉得我做人还算公平公正
Well, I consider myself a fair man.

707
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,100
你找我想谈什么
What exactly do you have to say?

708
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,420
我想说  你说的话我都明白了
I want to say I heard you before,

709
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,330
之前是我没有尊重你和你们的办公室
and I didn't treat you or your office with any respect,

710
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,170
所以我希望我们能重新开始
and I'm hoping we can have a fresh start.

711
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,970
很好
That's wonderful.

712
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,480
我很感动
I'm touched.

713
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,390
拿着这个滚吧
Now take this and get the hell out.

714
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,450
-这是什么  -驱逐令
- What's that? - It's an eviction notice.

715
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,740
我警告过你
I gave you a warning.

716
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,380
可你却搞砸了  所以现在该滚了
You screwed the pooch and now you're out.

717
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,500
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

718
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,210
你冲我发火  我也道过歉了
You come at me, I apologize to you,

719
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,230
你却跟我玩这个
and then you do this?

720
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,370
我冲你发火和你跟我道歉这期间
Well, in between those two things,

721
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,610
你交易员们居然在
your traders were playing touch football

722
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,310
我爱惜的大办公室里玩橄榄球
in my beloved bullpen,

723
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,200
所以你的道歉我不接受
so I don't accept your bullshit apology.

724
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,310
你不能随便就把我们赶走
You won't get away with this.

725
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,560
已经赶了
I already did.

726
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,160
你真是个混蛋
You're a son of a bitch.

727
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,810
没错  我是个
Yeah, a son of a bitch who's got

728
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,660
对纽约地方法规烂熟于心的混蛋
the full weight of the New York City Legal Code on his side.

729
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,730
这就是给你上的第一课
And you just learned lesson number one.

730
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,730
千万别惹毛哈佛律师
Don't ever mess with a Harvard goddamn lawyer.

731
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,180
先生您好
Excuse me, sir?

732
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,530
不用紧张  我知道是哪个位置
Relax, I know where I'm going.

733
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,720
那是当然  但我觉得
I'm sure you do, but I don't think

734
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,420
您要找的人并不在那个座位上
you're going to find what you're looking for.

735
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,160
你说什么
What did you just say to me?

736
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,760
抱歉  有人告诉我在这个时间段
I'm sorry, but you match the description of a man

737
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,910
会有个和您长得差不多的人进来
I was told would be walking in here right about now.

738
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,910
他是怎么形容我的长相的
And what exactly is the description?

739
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,230
我还是不说为妙  但描述跟你丝毫不差
I'd rather not say, but it fit you to a T.

740
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,030
因此我敢确定
So I'm fairly confident you're the one

741
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,210
您就是本该和内森・伯恩斯共进晚餐的人
that was supposed to have dinner with Nathan Burns.

742
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,990
-说吧  -说什么
- Let's have it. - Have what?

743
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,900
他让你给我带的口信
The message you're supposed to give me.

744
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,190
他想对你说
He wanted me to tell you

745
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,040
你晚餐迟到让他受到了羞辱
that being late to dinner was a slap in the face,

746
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,640
让你带着你的提议见鬼去
and you could take your offer and shove it up your ass.

747
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,100
该死的  唐娜  我不是说让你联系内森
Goddamn it, Donna, I told you to call Nathan's office

748
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,210
告诉他我会晚到吗
and tell him I'd be late.

749
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,040
别来指责我  我联系过了
Don't "Goddamn it, Donna" me, I did call them.

750
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,540
可他没在餐厅
Well, he wasn't at the restaurant,

751
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,930
也就是说他没收到信息
so your message didn't get through.

752
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,950
我并没有给他留言  哈维
I didn't leave a message, Harvey.

753
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,400
我跟他的秘书联系的  我们认识十二年了
I spoke to his secretary who I've known for 12 years,

754
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,100
她说南森说没问题
and she said that Nathan said it was okay.

755
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,260
那不是他撒谎了就是秘书撒谎了
Then either he lied or she did,

756
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,980
但肯定不是他因为他可能是混蛋
and it wasn't him because he may be an asshole,

757
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,220
但是就像他说的那样  他说话算话
but as he likes to put it, his word is his bond.

758
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,350
除非有人改变了他的主意
Unless somebody changed his mind.

759
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,690
什么意思
What are you talking about?

760
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,320
唯一能给南森・巴恩斯这样的混蛋
The only person who has the power to put pressure

761
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,230
施加压力的人肯定是一个更混蛋的人
on an asshole like Nathan Burns is a bigger asshole,

762
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,390
再说你之前也说了  威廉・萨特会不择手段
and you said it yourself, William Sutter will do anything

763
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,640
得到他想要的东西
to get what he wants.

764
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,750
唐娜  我需要你联系戈德曼的比尔・约翰逊
Donna, I need you to get Bill Johnson at Goldman,

765
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,200
我要你现在就去
and I need you to do it right now.

766
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,020
-我不能  -为什么不能
- I can't. - Why the hell not?

767
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,450
因为他已经不在那里工作了
Because he doesn't work there anymore.

768
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,760
-该死  -哈维
- Oh, shit. - Harvey.

769
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,960
唐娜  我需要有人能告诉我
Donna, I need somebody who can tell me

770
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,580
萨特是否在买进股票
if Sutter's buying shares,

771
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,910
我需要在明天股市开盘之前知道
and I need it before the market opens tomorrow.

772
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,540
那路易刚把我们的办公室租给一群操盘手
Then it's a good thing Louis just rented our offices

773
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,110
倒是件好事了
to a bunch of traders.

774
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,620
杰西卡  太好了  你在
Oh, good, Jessica, you're here.

775
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,340
我要起草一些合同
I...I had a few contracts I need to file.

776
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,080
我需要你的签名
I just need your signature.

777
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,470
别以为我不知道过去五年
You think I don't know you've been

778
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,090
你一直在这些东西上伪造
forging my signature on shit like this

779
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,470
我的签名
for the last five years?

780
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,050
抱歉
I'm sorry...

781
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,130
你才不抱歉
No, you're not.

782
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,330
你也不需要抱歉
And you don't need to be.

783
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,060
你只是在给我节约时间而已
You were just trying to save me some time.

784
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,740
告诉我你来找我的真正目的吧
Now, why don't you tell me why you're really here?

785
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:32,030
这学期我在上应用伦理学
I... I'm taking a practical ethics course this semester.

786
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,170
我好久没读过那本书了
Well, it's been a long time since I read that textbook.

787
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,190
不是书的问题
My problem's not with the textbook.

788
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,710
是迈克
Mike.

789
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,580
一个同学为了赢我
One of my classmates stuck him in my face

790
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,390
在整个班面前攻击我
in front of the entire class to win an argument.

791
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,790
而你唯一想做的
And the only thing you want to

792
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,330
就是给她脸上来一拳吗
stick in her face is your fist?

793
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,080
差不多吧
Something like that.

794
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,930
然后教授给了我一个"无罪计划"项目
So the professor offered me an Innocence Project case,

795
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,120
我想要接受  但如果我接受了...
and I want to take it, but if I do...

796
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,380
其他的同学就会认为你怕她
The other students will think you're afraid of her.

797
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,510
对
Exactly.

798
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,560
那你就得让他们都怕你
Then you have to make all of them afraid of you.

799
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,200
然后他们对你的唯一印象就是
Then the only impression they'll have of you

800
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,270
你是一个惹不得的女人
is that you're one badass woman.

801
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,890
我怎么感觉你在法学院
Why do I get the feeling that when you were in law school

802
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,570
也经历过这种事
you went through something just like this?

803
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,620
瑞秋  我不知道你有没有注意到
Rachel, I don't know if you've been paying attention,

804
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:20,040
其实我每天都经历着这种事
but I go through something like this every damn day.

805
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,250
我想你就是负责的人吧
I take it you're the man in charge.

806
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,070
-你为什么这么觉得  -因为你还在这里
- What makes you think that? - Because you're still here,

807
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,100
而股市六个小时前就关闭了
and the markets closed six hours ago.

808
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,420
也许我正背着女朋友
Maybe I'm just here cheating on my girlfriend

809
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,570
和秘书偷情
with my secretary.

810
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,580
我说过了  你是负责的人
Like I said, you're the man in charge.

811
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,780
我喜欢你
I like you,

812
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,600
但你大老远跑到我的办公室肯定不只是
but you didn't come all the way down to my office

813
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,120
为了拍我马屁的吧  所以你何不直说呢
just to kiss my ass, so why don't you just get to it?

814
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,130
我需要知道谁买了这个公司5%的股份
I need to know who just bought 5% of this company.

815
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,630
恐怕我不能告诉你
Well, that's gonna be a problem

816
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,270
因为买的人  无论是谁  三个月内
because whoever it was doesn't have to file

817
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,890
都不用向证监会提交文件
with the SEC for three months.

818
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,420
你说得没错  我不是来拍你马屁的
You're right, I didn't come down here to kiss your ass,

819
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,990
但是我也不是来重上
but I didn't come for a refresher

820
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,980
证券法的
on securities law either.

821
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,870
我来是因为你这样的人可以帮我得到我想要的
I'm here because a guy like you can get me what I need.

822
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,200
我为什么要帮你
And why should I help you,

823
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,930
在我跪着求你的合伙人
when I went to your partner on my hands and knees

824
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,210
他仍然要撤我租的前提下
and I'm still gonna lose my lease

825
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,530
就因为我吃了他几个麦麸棒吗
because I ate a couple of goddamn bran bars?

826
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,660
在我看来  只要你给我我想要的  
You give me what I need, as far as I'm concerned,

827
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,530
你就是把路易的麦麸棒都扔出去也没事
you can throw every bran bar Louis has off the roof.

828
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,850
我有人能够给你想要的信息
I got a guy that can get you that information.

829
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,480
不  不  不  不  
Oh, no, no, no, no.

830
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,650
现在我知道了你的把柄
Now that I know you got something to lose,

831
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,460
我需要你做一点小投资
I need you to make a little investment.

832
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,140
你真的要为我搞你的合伙人吗
You serious about me sticking it to your partner?

833
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,940
你以为过去十年
What do you think I've been doing to him

834
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,470
我都在对他做些什么
for the last ten years?

835
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,250
准备好第二轮了吗
Are you ready for round two?

836
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,300
好了
I am.

837
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,830
其实  我想我已经赢了
In fact, I think I already won,

838
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,820
因为在一场辩论中
because one of the easiest things

839
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,860
最简单的事情就是攻击辩论者
to do in a debate is to attack the debater.

840
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,940
这是什么
What is this?

841
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,760
你能攻击我是因为我的未婚夫所做的事情
You went after me because of something that my fiancé did,

842
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,140
但其实  每个人都有见不得人的事
but the truth is, we all have skeletons in our closets.

843
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,850
而我和你的区别在于
The difference between you and me

844
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,770
我根本不屑利用这些东西
is that I don't care to use them.

845
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,700
你想要什么
What do you want?

846
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,240
我想你知道我想要什么
I think you know what I want.

847
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,910
我们开始吧
Shall we get started?

848
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,340
我想要就我对
I'd like to apologize

849
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,300
瑞秋・赞恩说过的话道歉
for saying what I said to Rachel Zane.

850
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,210
我这样做
I only did what I did

851
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,390
仅仅是因为她
because she's my

852
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,280
比我更聪明  比我更道德
intellectual and ethical superior.

853
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,240
我感觉很羞愧
I'm ashamed of myself,

854
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,420
这场比赛我主动认输
and I forfeit this competition.

855
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,800
你怎么做到让她这样的
How'd you get her to say that?

856
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,720
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

857
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,010
重要的是  现在大家都知道
What matters is, everyone here knows

858
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,590
我不害怕她了
that I'm not afraid of her.

859
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,030
那我想你是要留下了
I take it that means you're staying in the class then?

860
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,930
不
Nope.

861
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,420
这是我的正式退课申请
That is my official drop-out request.

862
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,170
我要接受"无罪计划"
I'm doing the Innocence Project.

863
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,760
你来干什么  哈维
What are you doing here, Harvey?

864
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,200
你都没有给我个机会让我向你展示
You didn't give me a chance to show you all the motions

865
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,630
我提交的那些动议  好帮你处理那个混蛋
I filed to keep that bastard out of your backyard.

866
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,150
因为我跟你说了  晚餐你要是迟到
Because I told you if you were late for dinner

867
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,580
那就自己玩去
you could go screw yourself.

868
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,500
不  你没给我一个展示的机会是因为
No, you didn't give me a chance to show you

869
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,610
你害怕威廉・萨特
because you're afraid of William Sutter,

870
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,910
但其实你该怕的人是我
when the person you should be afraid of is me.

871
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,230
你在说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

872
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,030
你以为我不知道
You think I don't know

873
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,020
他半夜买下了你的一部分股份
he bought a piece of you in the middle of the night,

874
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,260
现在正鼓动董事会开除你吗
and now he's pressuring the board to kick you out?

875
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,100
好吧
Okay, fine.

876
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,760
确实  我是鲸鱼  可他是鲨鱼
He did, but I'm a whale, and he's a shark,

877
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,320
我别无选择
and I have no other choice.

878
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,240
有件事我得告诉你  南森
I got a little news for you, Nathan.

879
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,160
我也有你公司的股份
I got a piece of your company too,

880
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,800
也就是说要么你雇我
which means you either hire me

881
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,870
我们一起对抗那个混蛋
and we fight that bastard together,

882
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,670
要么你跟他站一边  跟我对着干
or you go with him and you take me on.

883
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,860
不论如何  
Either way,

884
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,250
这件事你都不可能全身而退
you're not walking out of this thing without a war.

885
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,150
我一直都是想合作的
All I ever wanted was to work together,

886
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,580
但我讨厌被威胁
but I do not like being bullied.

887
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,380
不  你是喜欢威胁别人  也正因为这个
No, you like to bully, which is exactly why

888
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,710
我才不愿意为你工作
I never wanted to represent you in the first place.

889
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,320
你来找我只是因为你需要我
You only came to me because you needed me.

890
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,580
你才不在乎我是什么样的人
You didn't care.

891
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,060
没错  南森  我是不在乎
You're right, Nathan, I didn't,

892
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,020
但如你所说  你说话算数
but like you said, your word is your bond.

893
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,740
现在你面前就是个兑现这句话的机会
This is a chance for you to keep it,

894
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,110
也许现在我们可以重新好好认识一下了
and maybe now we can actually start off on the right foot.

895
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,660
好吧  哈维
Okay, Harvey.

896
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,740
我加入
I'm in.

897
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,350
两年五个月零十二天
Two years, five months, 12 days.

898
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,530
我对你多久没要过女人了
I'm not interested in hearing how long it's been

899
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,040
不感兴趣
since you got laid.

900
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,440
不  这是你还得在这里
No, that's exactly how long it's gonna be

901
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,070
待着的时间
until you walk out of here.

902
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,460
你是想让我现在就揍你吗
You trying to get me to attack you right here?

903
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,680
因为你再说它就要实现了
Because that's what's gonna happen.

904
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,370
我只是想告诉你
I'm just trying to tell you

905
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,000
再过六周你就能被保释
that you're eligible for parole in six weeks.

906
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,970
胡扯
Bullshit.

907
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,050
你不相信我
You don't believe me?

908
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,310
好吧  你自己看
All right, take a look for yourself.

909
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,400
都写在上面了
It's all right there.

910
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,720
你识字的  对吧
You can read, right?

911
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,410
是的  我识字
Yeah, I can read,

912
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,250
但我们跟你不一样  不是冒牌律师
but we're not all fake lawyers like you,

913
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,520
所以你赶紧说这上面到底是什么
so why don't you tell me what it is I'm looking at?

914
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,180
你在等待审判期间在监狱服刑的时间
The time you served while awaiting trial

915
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,460
没有被算入刑期
was never factored into your sentence.

916
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,420
你的律师失职了
Your lawyer dropped the ball.

917
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,240
他为什么要那么做
And why the hell would he do that?

918
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,380
因为有一条神秘法令
Because of an arcane statute

919
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,170
十个律师九个都不知道  但我知道
that nine out of ten lawyers don't know about, but I do.

920
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,070
你以为我不知道这是你的保护人
You think I don't know this is your protector's idea

921
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,420
用来保护你的把戏吗
to get me off your back?

922
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,930
没用的
'Cause it's not gonna work.

923
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,380
不  弗兰克
No, Frank.

924
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,470
哈维想的办法是让我告诉这些人
Harvey's idea was for me to tell these guys

925
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,070
你进来的真正原因
that the real reason you're here

926
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,470
是因为你做了线人
is because you're an informant.

927
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,810
你敢把这事告诉别人  我就杀了你
You tell that to one living soul, I'll kill you.

928
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,980
我想你该决定的是
I guess you have to decide

929
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,080
你真要在这儿继续待两年
if you really want to spend the next two years

930
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,950
就为了找我麻烦
trying to mess with me

931
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,890
还是要选择好好度过你剩下的生命
or salvage what's left of your life.

932
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,760
如果你真要为了报复哈维就选择
If you're really gonna pick getting back at Harvey

933
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,340
放弃自由
over your own freedom,

934
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,350
那你真是我见过的最可悲的混蛋了
you really are the sorriest son of a bitch I've ever met.

935
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,930
这儿到底是怎么回事
What the goddamn hell is going on in here?

936
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,470
看起来不错  不是吗
It's looking good, isn't it?

937
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,650
伙计  你算是上了死亡名单了
Okay, buddy, you just signed your death warrant.

938
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,080
我之前给了你三十天  现在改成三十分钟
I gave you 30 days, now you've got 30 minutes.

939
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,790
我觉得你没戏  老大
I don't think that's happening, boss.

940
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,190
我们不但要留下
Not only are we staying,

941
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,370
而且还要用你心爱的大办公室
but we're making your beloved bullpen

942
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,900
做我们的操作中心
the center of our operations,

943
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,570
因为你大哥修改了我们的租约
because your big bro amended our lease.

944
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,480
胡扯
This is bullshit.

945
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,640
哈维为什么要这么做
Why the hell would Harvey do that?

946
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,480
简单来说就是  我帮了他一个忙
Let's just say I helped him out of a jam.

947
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,980
这事没完  因为不管哈维做了什么
This isn't over, because whatever Harvey did,

948
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,480
他对合同法的了解可没我多
he doesn't know contracts like I do.

949
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,550
但你对合同法的了解又不如我
And you don't know them like I know them,

950
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,480
因为这个新租约比你妈妈还难破
because this new lease is tighter than your mom's ass.

951
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,040
就冲你这句话  我要告你诽谤
That's it. I am suing you for slander,

952
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,720
因为我妈妈一点都不难破
because my mom's ass is miles from tight.

953
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,860
我信了  哥们儿  那你尽管试好了
I'll take your word for it, bro, and bring it on,

954
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,540
因为虽然你是哈佛毕业律师
because you might be a Harvard-educated lawyer,

955
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,090
但我们耶鲁毕业的律师也不好惹
but I'm a Yale-educated lawyer,

956
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,970
而你我的区别在于
and the difference between me and you

957
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,900
我知道交易才能赚大钱
is I know the real money's in trading.

958
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,530
现在请你离开我的大办公室
Now get the hell out of my bullpen.

959
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,090
-哈维  -威廉
- Harvey. - William.

960
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,440
我有东西给你
I got something for you.

961
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,630
我猜是等我签的合约吧
I assume it's an engagement letter for me to sign.

962
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,360
这是你将要提交的证管会表格
It's the SEC form you're gonna have to file

963
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,110
用于购买南森・巴恩斯公司5%的股权
for buying 5% of Nathan Burns's company.

964
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,160
-你知道了  -我不光知道
- So you know. - I don't just know.

965
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,330
我买下一个董事会席位
I bought a seat at the table,

966
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,470
我有南森和董事会站在我这边
and I got Nathan and the board on my side.

967
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,680
一派胡言
Bullshit.

968
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,740
你们没人有胆量反对我
None of you have the balls to go up against me.

969
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,530
我不是来反对你的  威廉
I'm not here to go up against you, William.

970
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,320
我来是给你点小钱  买回你的股份
I'm here to buy your shares back at a tidy little profit

971
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,900
你可以用这点钱
so you can use it to hire

972
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,500
随便雇谁来当你的律师
whoever you want to be your lawyer

973
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,560
因为我肯定不会受雇于你的
because it sure as hell isn't gonna be me.

974
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,940
我也可以确保他的公司
Yeah, maybe instead I'll make sure his company

975
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,150
落进我的口袋  然后永远不雇你
gets in my pocket, never hires you,

976
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,850
让你的律所连这一季度都撑不过
and your firm is out of business by the end of the quarter.

977
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,140
那是不可能的
Well, that's never gonna happen,

978
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,990
因为唯一赢下这一局的办法
because the only way to win this thing

979
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,020
是自己趟进浑水搞一身泥
is to get down in the mud,

980
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,420
如果我是你的律师
and if I was gonna be your lawyer,

981
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,740
当然我绝对不会是
which I'm never gonna be,

982
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,690
我会告诉你  在你面对诉讼威胁时
I'd tell you that's the last place you want to be

983
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,450
最不该做的就是这件事
when you're staring down the barrel of an indictment.

984
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,490
你知道你这是在把我
You know you're making an enemy of me

985
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,230
变成你余生中的敌人
for the rest of your life.

986
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
随你便  哥们  因为我有一件
Take a number, buddy, because one thing

987
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,690
绝对不会做的事
I'm never gonna do is get involved

988
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,980
就是跟你这样的卑鄙小人扯上关系
with a shady piece of shit like you.

989
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,930
你要去看电影吗
So you going to the movie?

990
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,870
没这个打算
I wasn't planning on it.

991
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,360
那里漆黑一片  拥挤不堪
It's pitch black. Packed in.

992
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,160
加洛可能会找事
Gallo might try something.

993
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,090
你不是说过你有办法
I thought you said you had some way

994
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,620
摆脱他的么
to get him off our backs.

995
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,430
我还不知道能不能奏效
Yeah, I don't know if it worked yet or not.

996
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,280
那不重要  因为电影之夜是神圣的
Well, it doesn't matter, because movie night is sacred.

997
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,490
什么意思
What do you mean?

998
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,130
这是这里所有人都期待的夜晚
I mean it's one night that every guy in here looks forward to,

999
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,540
没人希望出事
you know, doesn't want to mess up.

1000
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,410
谁在那里找事  结果都会
You try something in there, you're gonna end up

1001
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,510
变成我老室友  马克・辛吉斯那样
like my old roommate, Mark Higgins.

1002
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,180
今天要播什么
Well, what's playing?

1003
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,870
《红潮风暴》[1995年电影]
"Crimson Tide."

1004
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,950
你不是开玩笑吧
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

1005
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,780
我跟你说了
Well, you heard what I said about

1006
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,270
电影之夜是神圣的  对吧
the sanctity of movie night, right?

1007
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,730
另外  我绝不会拿丹泽尔・华盛顿开玩笑
Besides, me, I never joke about Denzel.

1008
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,560
"金刚跟我比根本不算啥
"King Kong ain't got shit on me!

1009
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,360
不是我们踩上了普利茅斯岩"
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock."

1010
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,620
"是普利茅斯岩压着我们了"
"Plymouth Rock landed on us."

1011
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,310
真是该死
Shit.

1012
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,290
这是什么
What's this?

1013
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,560
你的新工作
That's your new job.

1014
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,780
从现在开始  你跟他一起在厨房当值
From now on you're doing kitchen duty with him.

1015
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,460
如果被我抓到你跟典狱长有接触
And if I catch you doing the warden,

1016
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,040
就等着单独监禁吧
you're going to solitary.

1017
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,060
我没要求去厨房当值
I didn't ask for kitchen duty.

1018
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,970
或许没有  但我知道是谁给你的
Maybe not, but I think I know who gave it to you.

1019
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,510
我听说你去见了威廉・萨特
I heard you went to see William Sutter.

1020
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,910
总得有人去告诉他要死自己死
