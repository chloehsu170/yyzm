{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,520
艾弗里・麦肯诺曾经是
Avery McKernon was the first client

16
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,620
我带进律所的第一位客户
I ever brought into the firm.

17
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,490
我拿我的引擎和布伦森
I have stacked my engines up against Bronson

18
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,790
以及世界所有的引擎比过
and everyone else's in the world,

19
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,740
我的引擎完胜
and mine win,

20
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,170
因为我确保它们是全世界设计得最好的
Because I make sure they're designed better than anyone else's.

21
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,780
那这就是你的演讲内容
And that's the speech you're gonna give.

22
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,670
我说过要把麦肯诺的一半业务给你
I said I was giving you 50% of Mckernon.

23
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,830
但没说我会保留另一半
I didn't say I was keeping the other 50%.

24
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,700
你终于意识到他们的代理需要升级了
You finally realized they need an upgrade in representation?

25
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,890
都取决于你  杰克
It's up to you, Jack.

26
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,130
要么支持C35条款
Stand by provision C35

27
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,560
要么就滚蛋
or pack up your shit.

28
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,500
我想让你告诉我
I want you to tell me

29
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,430
你作为心理医生犯的最严重的一次错误是什么
the worst mistake you ever made as a therapist?

30
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,040
我们之前可没约定这个
That wasn't part of the deal.

31
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,950
-我害死了一个人  -什么
- I killed someone. - What?

32
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,010
一个客户需要人把他儿子从戒毒所弄出来
A client needed someone to get his son out of rehab

33
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,170
好让他去参加他妈妈的葬礼
so that he could attend his mother's funeral.

34
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,280
我内心深处知道他还没准备好
I knew deep down inside he wasn't ready,

35
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,140
但依然给他放行了
but I gave the go-ahead anyway,

36
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,190
就在葬礼当晚...
and the night of the funeral...

37
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,350
他吸毒过量致死
he overdosed and died.

38
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,310
我很意外你又预约来了
I'm surprised you called for another appointment.

39
00:00:59,310 --> 00:00:59,980
还能说什么呢
What can I say?

40
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,930
你给我讲的那个故事打动了我
You telling me that story got to me.

41
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,340
所以你准备好说实话了吗
So you're ready to tell the truth?

42
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,360
准备好了  出现在我梦中的女人是唐娜
I am. The woman in my dream was Donna.

43
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,980
但我觉得你梦中的女人其实并不是唐娜
I don't think the woman in your dream was actually Donna.

44
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,150
我觉得是你母亲
I think it was your mother.

45
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,570
真是难以相信
I don't believe it.

46
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,750
我把困扰了我好几天的事情告诉了你
I tell you the thing that's been eating at me for days,

47
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,980
你却说我撒谎吗
and you call me a liar?

48
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,620
不  我不是说你撒谎
No, I'm not calling you a liar.

49
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,840
你的梦是一系列未决问题的结合重演
Your dream was a representation of unresolved issues.

50
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,940
唯一的未决问题是我向你吐露心声
The only unresolved issue is I told you the truth,

51
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,570
你却来攻击我
and you're turning on me.

52
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,770
提你母亲不是攻击你
Bringing up your mother isn't turning on you.

53
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,670
你完全不了解提我母亲对我意味着什么
You have no idea what bringing up my mother is to me.

54
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,170
我不了解
No, I don't.

55
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,300
但那正是我们现在所做一切的意义
That's the whole point of what we're doing here.

56
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,820
我们现在做什么都不重要了
Well, it doesn't matter what we're doing here,

57
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,150
因为我们结束了
'cause I'm not staying.

58
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,900
哈维  我不在乎你挣多少钱
Harvey, I don't care how much money you make

59
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,150
睡过多少女人
or how many women you sleep with.

60
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,750
你生命中有一些问题
You have issues in your life

61
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,810
会导致你难以获得真正的爱情
that are going to keep you from having real relationships.

62
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,840
你尽可以跟自己说
Now, you can tell yourself

63
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,420
这一切与你的母亲毫无干系
it has nothing to do with your mother all you want,

64
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,200
但那是自欺欺人  你自己也清楚
but it's a lie, and you know it.

65
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,160
我说过我们结束了
And I said we're done.

66
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,890
路易  我们得谈谈
Louis, we need to talk.

67
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,530
如果是关于那个有狐臭的暑假实习生
Oh, if it's about the summer associate with B.O.,

68
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,800
我无能为力
that is out of my control.

69
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,200
是关于杰克・索罗夫
It's about Jack Soloff.

70
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,720
什么  我发誓假如那混蛋
What? So help me, if that asshole

71
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,850
不守信用  我...
is backing out of his agreement, I--

72
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,660
没有人不守信用
No one's backing out of anything.

73
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,890
那是怎么回事
Well, then what's the problem?

74
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,150
目前什么事也没有
Right now there is no problem.

75
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,260
我们打败他了  他不反对我们了
We beat him. He's been neutralized.

76
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,030
但我可不希望他一直"不反对"
But that's not where I want him to stay.

77
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,980
什么意思
What do you mean?

78
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,880
意思是我们虽然赢了
I mean we've won,

79
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,610
但他证明了自己的能耐
but the man's shown himself to be a force.

80
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,360
假如他以后还要站在我们这边
And if he's ever gonna come around to being on our side,

81
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,580
我们得给他时间舔舐伤口
we have to give him time to lick his wounds.

82
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,640
我不管你怎么说
I don't care what you say,

83
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,200
但那只黄鼠狼绝不会跟我们一边的
but that weasel is never gonna be on our side.

84
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,070
就是你这种小心眼
And that's exactly the kind of petty thinking

85
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,080
让你和斯科特  哈德曼 
that led to your feuds with Scottie, Hardman,

86
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,180
哈维  我  等人之间起了嫌隙 
Harvey, me, just to name a few.

87
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,600
杰西卡  这不一样  你明白的
Jessica, this is different, and you know it.

88
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,800
杰克挑起了这整件事
Jack started this whole thing.

89
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,020
路易  昨晚你问
Louis, last night you asked

90
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,840
什么时候你才能学会听我的话
when were you going to learn to listen to me.

91
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,470
现在就开始吧
The time is now.

92
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,860
-但你说...  -我不管我说了什么
- And you said-- - I don't care what I said.

93
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,510
假如你在对待杰克的这件事上
If you let your pettiness

94
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,900
继续这么小心眼
get the better of you with Jack,

95
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,470
我敢断言
so help me god,

96
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,520
最后赢的绝对不是你
you will not be the one left standing.

97
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,440
我保证照你说的办
You have my word.

98
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,750
路易  我得和你谈谈
Louis, I need to talk to you,

99
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,930
但希望你别生气
and I don't want you to be upset.

100
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,620
怎么了
What is it?

101
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,630
多米尼克・巴伦刚刚打电话过来
Dominic Barone called.

102
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,770
他想过来开个会
He wants to come in for a meeting.

103
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,950
我知道他选择了打给我...
Now, I know he called me--

104
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,690
太好了  定个时间
Excellent. Pick a time.

105
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,180
你没因为他打给我而不是打给你而生气
But you're not mad that he called me instead of you?

106
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,420
我为什么要生气
Why would I be mad?

107
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,840
我没进错办公室吧
Am I in the right office?

108
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,710
迈克  那是原来的路易
Mike, you're thinking of the old Louis.

109
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,420
现在的路易可不是小心眼
The new Louis is not petty,

110
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,190
他也绝对不会因为谁打给谁
and he definitely does not get upset

111
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,850
这种事情而生气
about things like who called who.

112
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,670
我能问问这个新路易是从哪儿冒出来的吗
And may I ask where the new Louis came from?

113
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,650
从内心深处
From inside.

114
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,710
我对着镜子审视自己
I took a look at the man in the mirror,

115
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,320
并下定决心是时候做出改变了
and I decided it was time to make a change.

116
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,000
很开心你这样做
Well, I'm glad you did.

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,620
我不知道多米尼克有什么要求
And I don't know what Dominic wants,

118
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,800
但不管怎样
but whatever it is,

119
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,150
我期待就此事和你合作
I'm looking forward to working with you on it.

120
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,870
-你刚刚听见了吗  -听见了
- Did you just hear that? - Yes.

121
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,620
那你也明白一旦迈克和多米尼克约好了时间
Then you know once Mike and Dominic agree to a time,

122
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,650
你必须把它改期
you need to reschedule it.

123
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,280
路易
Louis.

124
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,400
多米尼克必须知道是我说了算
Dominic needs to learn that I'm the man in charge.

125
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,490
但事实并不是你说了算
But you're not the man in charge,

126
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,000
因为哈维让你和迈克共同代理麦肯诺汽车公司
because Harvey gave you and Mike McKernon Motors to share.

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,230
但多米尼克不知道这点
But Dominic doesn't know that,

128
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,990
迈克和我同时递给他名片
and Mike and I gave him a card at the same time.

129
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,340
迈克上面写着"助理律师"
And Mike's says "Associate,"

130
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,060
我的上面写着"皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特"
and mine says "Pearson Specter Litt,"

131
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,350
并且我像往常一样把"皮尔逊-斯佩克特"划掉了
and I crossed out the "Pearson Specter" like I always do.

132
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,030
路易  你没有听到杰西卡说的
Louis, did you not hear what Jessica said

133
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,440
不要那么小心眼吗
about stopping all the pettiness?

134
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,570
但那是说杰克・索罗夫的事
Yeah, that was about Jack Soloff.

135
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,670
不对  那说的是小心眼的事
No, it was about pettiness.

136
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,870
唐娜  对不起
Donna, I'm sorry, but I only have

137
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,190
但我不小心眼的额度有限
a certain amount of non-pettiness in me,

138
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,040
真正的路易・利特总要有发挥的地方
and the real Louis Litt needs to come out somewhere.

139
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,310
好吧  路易  如果你想让多米尼克认为是你说了算
Okay, louis, you want Dominic to think you're the man?

140
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,930
那你就不要纠结他电话打给了谁
Then you need to stop worrying about who he called

141
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,180
关心一下他的需求吧
and start worrying about what he needs,

142
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,580
也就是你要做个优秀的律师
which is for you to be a great lawyer.

143
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,120
{\an8}皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特

144
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,380
很好  你在这
Good, you're here.

145
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,680
约翰逊的简报写好了吗
Did you file the Johnson brief?

146
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,290
-还没  -那今早弄好
- Not yet. - Then do it this morning.

147
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,470
我准备今天下午抓紧对付他们
I want to drop the hammer on those guys this afternoon.

148
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,120
在那之前  有个山姆・塔尔要见你
Well, before you do, there's a Sam Tull waiting to see you.

149
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,450
山姆・塔尔又是谁
Who the hell is Sam Tull?

150
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,610
条顺  盘靓  深邃的蓝眼睛
Tall, handsome, steely blue eyes?

151
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,780
没想起来
Not ringing any bells.

152
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,480
那也许这能让你想起来
Well, maybe this will knock the cobwebs out.

153
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,840
他说上次你见到他时
He said the last time you saw him,

154
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,770
他与莫雷洛资产管理公司共事
he was with Morello Asset management

155
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,540
你还威胁要修理他
and you threatened to kick his ass.

156
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,750
你让他进我办公室了
You let him in my office?

157
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,720
你觉得我有那么年幼无知吗
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

158
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,820
他现在在会议室
He's in the conference room

159
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,090
瑞秋・赞恩在看着他
under the supervision of one Rachel Zane.

160
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,970
我跟他说如果他不乖
I told him if he didn't behave himself,

161
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,400
我会亲自修理他
I'd kick his ass myself.

162
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,500
你一定会吧
You'd do that, wouldn't you?

163
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,890
我当然会
I sure as hell would.

164
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,340
如果你不马上过去
And if you don't get in there this second,

165
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,650
我也会修理你
I'll kick yours.

166
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,210
别跟我说你来
Don't tell me you're here

167
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,170
是为了接受我的挑战出去单挑的
to take me up on that offer to step outside.

168
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,030
我不是
I'm not.

169
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,250
那就好  那看来我们有共识
Good, then we've established

170
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,710
你比上次见面时聪明了
that you're smarter than the last time I saw you.

171
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,080
赶紧滚出我们的办公室
Now get the hell out of our offices.

172
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,120
哈维  人家专程来找我们的
Harvey, the man came to see us.

173
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,460
瑞秋  这人是个混蛋
Rachel, this man is an asshole,

174
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,600
他愿意让一个无辜的人承受牢狱之灾
and he was willing to let an innocent person go to jail.

175
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,190
我现在就是个有可能进监狱的无辜之人
And now I'm an innocent person who could go to jail.

176
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,260
什么
What?

177
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,660
我被指控进行未授权交易
I'm being accused of making unauthorized trades.

178
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,590
-被莫雷洛吗  -我不在那里工作了
- By Morello? - I don't work there anymore.

179
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,730
我现在在巴特勒
I work at Butler trading.

180
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,580
真不错  那他们到底授权没有
Good for you. Were they authorized or not?

181
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,240
我发誓我没有做任何
I swear to god I didn't do one thing

182
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,370
他们不知道的事
they don't know about.

183
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,130
让我猜猜  但你没证据
And let me guess, you don't have any proof?

184
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,970
对  没有
No, I don't...

185
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,840
因为事情就是这样运作的
Because that's the way things work.

186
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,120
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

187
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,610
他的意思是他们检查过他的交易
It means he's saying they checked his trades

188
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,250
认可了风险
enough to decide it was okay with the risk

189
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,800
但是觉得不能落在纸面上
but not enough to put it in writing.

190
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,150
好吧  但他们为什么不把它落在纸面上
Okay, but why wouldn't they put it in writing?

191
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,030
因为他们宁愿说我欺诈
Because they would rather say I went rogue

192
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,100
也不愿缴纳两百万美元的罚款
than pay a $2 million fine.

193
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,610
但我的问题是  山姆
Here's the problem, Sam.

194
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,620
我为什么要相信你  上次我们见面时
Why should I believe you, when the last time we met

195
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,000
宁愿让一个无辜的人进监狱的可是你
you were the one who was willing to put an innocent person away?

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,970
因为我不知道她是无辜的
Because I didn't know she was innocent.

197
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,650
事实是...我完全不在乎
And the truth is... I didn't care.

198
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,590
但你在乎
But you did.

199
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,940
我实话跟你说
I'm telling you...

200
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,640
我没有做那些事
I didn't do this.

201
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,260
拜托  我需要你的帮助
Please, I need your help.

202
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,280
如果我发现你骗了我
If I find out you're lying to me,

203
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,860
这次可不只是威胁那么简单了
this time I won't just threaten you.

204
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,880
我绝对会弄死你
I will beat the shit out of you.

205
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,530
唐娜  我能和你聊聊吗
Donna, could I talk to you for a minute?

206
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,050
可以  但你要告诉我蜂蜜被藏到哪里去了
Yeah, if you can tell me where the honey is hiding.

207
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,120
你这个狡猾的小熊
Oh, sneaky little bear.

208
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,100
你想说什么
So what's on your mind?

209
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,120
是这样  我在为婚礼
Okay, so I'm trying to plan

210
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,630
策划一些特别的创意
something special for our wedding.

211
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,150
什么  我们要结婚了吗
What? We're getting married?

212
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,230
迈克  这太突然了  我得想一想
Mike, this is so sudden. I'm gonna have to think about it.

213
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,920
那瑞秋怎么办  算了  谁管她
And what about Rachel? Oh, who cares about rachel?

214
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,440
-我爱你  -你演完了吗
- I love you. - Are you finished?

215
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,480
-必须吗  -唐娜  我很认真的
- Do I have to be? - Donna, I'm serious.

216
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,640
好吧  你需要什么
Okay, what do you need?

217
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,000
瑞秋告诉过我
Rachel told me it was her fantasy

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,250
她的梦想是生日那天在纽约广场酒店结婚
to get married on her birthday at the Plaza Hotel.

219
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,330
所以我打电话去订位  但是谁知...
So I called to arrange it, but then--

220
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,320
他们五年内都订满了
They're booked for the next five years.

221
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,570
你怎么知道
How did you know that?

222
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,700
你来找我不就因为这个吗  我无所不知
Same reason you came to me for help--I know what I know.

223
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,550
我需要跟那一样好的地方
Well, I need someplace just as good.

224
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,240
没有跟那一样好的地方
There is no place just as good.

225
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,420
那我该怎么办
So what am I supposed to do?

226
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,030
你已经做了你该做的
You already did what you're supposed to do.

227
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,020
向我求助
You came to me.

228
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,860
现在  把布罗迪放回去  这次别藏起来了
Now, put Brody back and don't hide him this time.

229
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,090
你给熊起了名字
You named the bear?

230
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,300
你还想要我帮忙吗
You want me to help you or not?

231
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,670
保罗・吉尔罗伊
Paul Gilroy.

232
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,100
我是  您是
Yes. And you are?

233
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,290
我是帮山姆・塔尔免除牢狱之灾的人
I'm the guy who's gonna keep Sam Tull out of jail.

234
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,440
如何免除呢  这位...
And how are you gonna do that, Mister--

235
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,550
斯佩克特
Specter.

236
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,330
哈维・斯佩克特
Harvey Specter.

237
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,380
你要交罚款  承认你的所作所为
You're gonna pay that fine and admit what you did.

238
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,580
抱歉我得让你失望了  斯佩克特先生
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Specter,

239
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,320
但没做过的事  我是不会承认的
but there's no way I'm admitting to something I didn't do.

240
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,480
不管你承认不承认
Whether you admit it or not,

241
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,850
你都得写张支票
you're gonna write a check either way.

242
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,630
两百万还是三千万  由你决定
It's up to you whether it's for $2 million or $30 million.

243
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,050
我的同事似乎迟到了
My associate seems to be running late,

244
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,810
所以说吧  继续胡说八道吧
so go ahead, take me for a walk down bullshit lane.

245
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,880
我们告你  要求赔偿三千万
We're suing you for $30 million.

246
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,070
那我肯定还炒掉了其他五个人
Well, I must have fired five other people,

247
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,850
因为不当解雇的罚款上限是五百万
because wrongful termination's capped at $5 million.

248
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,750
我们不告你们不当解雇
We're not suing you for wrongful termination.

249
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,630
要告你们恶意指控
We're suing you for malicious prosecution.

250
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,780
你们不能这么做  我不是检察官
You can't do that. I'm not a prosecutor.

251
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,780
你不是  但你以莫须有的罪名
No, you're not, but you're framing my client

252
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,450
诬陷我的委托人
for a crime he didn't commit.

253
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,920
所以你自己决定  保罗
So it's up to you, Paul.

254
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,200
开张小支票  还是大的
Write the little check or the big check.

255
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,820
看你的了
Ball's in your court.

256
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,200
多米尼克  你来得很早啊  你好吗
Dominic, you're here early. How are you?

257
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,070
很好
Good.

258
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,020
其实  我在想上次来的时候
In fact, I was just thinking about the last time I was here.

259
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,570
你帮我当上了首席执行官
You were helping me become C.E.O..

260
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,610
得了  你是凭自己的力量当上首席执行官的
Oh, come on, you pretty much became C.E.O. all on your own.

261
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,560
我怎么当上的不重要
Well, it doesn't matter how I got there.

262
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,840
你得帮我保住这个位置
You're gonna help me stay there.

263
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,870
那是什么
What's that?

264
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,200
电池供电引擎的未来
The future of battery-powered engines.

265
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,630
我们很需要它  否则就会被淘汰
We need it, or we don't survive.

266
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,090
我猜这里有个问题
I'm guessing there's a catch.

267
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,910
问题就是  它很贵
The catch is it costs a fortune.

268
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,220
但我已经跟山脉科技首席执行官达成口头协议了
But I have a handshake deal with the C.E.O. of Range Tech.

269
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,020
我们是一起从技师起家的
We started as mechanics together,

270
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,290
如果我能两周内完成交易
and if I can close in two weeks,

271
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,100
他就把整个公司以我出得起的价钱卖给我
He'll sell me the whole company at a price I can afford.

272
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,410
如果我不能  他就面向市场出售
If I can't, he puts it on the market.

273
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,570
那我们不出十年就得关门
We'll be out of business in ten years.

274
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,080
这是怎么回事
What's going on?

275
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,150
我没来你们就开始谈了
You guys starting the meeting without me?

276
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,430
不  多米尼克到得早
No, Dominic just got here early,

277
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,420
但主题是
but the headline is

278
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,040
他希望我们两周内完成口头协议
he wants us to close a handshake deal

279
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,040
买下山脉科技
to buy Range Tech within the next two weeks,

280
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,460
我刚想告诉他我们可以帮他
And I was about to tell him that we could.

281
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,640
抱歉  但我们帮不了
Well, I'm sorry, but we can't.

282
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,630
为什么这么说
What do you mean you can't?

283
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,030
因为我们没法在两周内完成这样的交易
I mean there's no way that we can close a deal like this

284
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,560
除非跳过尽职调查这一步
in two weeks without skipping due diligence.

285
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,100
不  路易
No, Louis,

286
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,240
他和那个首席执行官是三十年的老交情了
he's known the C.E.O. for 30 years.

287
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,390
我们当然不能跳过这一步
So we don't have to skip it,

288
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,540
但我们可以来个精简版
but we can do a streamlined version.

289
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,450
好吧  或者我们完全不插手
Okay, well, then we might as well not do it at all.

290
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,850
如果规定时间内搞不定
We don't get it done in that time,

291
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,930
这个协议就不作数了
I can lose this deal.

292
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,080
他们设置了时限
They put a clock on it.

293
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,250
他们为什么这么做
And why would they do that?

294
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,790
我来告诉你为什么
I'll tell you why,

295
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,320
因为他们知道你不会留意
because they know you won't pay attention

296
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,390
他们想要蒙混过去的事
to whatever it is that they're trying to slide by you.

297
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,890
蒙混过去
Slide something by me?

298
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,330
他是我的朋友  我们有口头协议
This is my friend. We have a handshake deal.

299
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,910
口头协议算个屁
A handshake deal doesn't mean shit.

300
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,300
-路易  -没事的  迈克
- Louis! - It's okay, Mike.

301
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,340
显然路易不明白我的意思
Obviously Louis doesn't get me.

302
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,280
因为对我来说  口头协议意味着一切
Because to me, a handshake deal means everything.

303
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,120
所以下周请尽力做尽职调查什么的
So you do whatever due diligence you can in the next week,

304
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,850
因为如果你搞砸了我的交易
because if you mess up my deal,

305
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,210
我就去别的律所了
I'll be looking for a new law firm.

306
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,380
保罗・吉尔罗伊的律师来电话了
Paul Gilroy's lawyer called.

307
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,090
好快
That was fast.

308
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,250
想听坏消息还是更坏的消息
Want the bad news or the worse news?

309
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,050
为什么不都告诉我
Why don't you give me both

310
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,490
由我来决定到底算什么消息
and let me decide what kind of news it is.

311
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,950
他们不但拒绝交罚款
Not only are they not paying the fine.

312
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,380
还起草了驳回我们诉讼的动议
They also filed a motion to have our suit dismissed.

313
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,450
-我本该知道的  -本该知道什么
- Man, I should've known. - Should've known what?

314
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,740
你说你不介意多米尼克给我打电话找我开会
That you were full of shit when you said Dominic calling me

315
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,490
根本就是胡说
to set up that meeting didn't bother you.

316
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,330
我不管他打给谁
I don't care who he called.

317
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,100
我之所以那么干是因为客户至上
I did what I did in there because the client comes first.

318
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,220
胡说  你先对我然后对多米尼克敌意满满
Bullshit, you antagonized me and then Dominic.

319
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,440
咱俩参加的不是同一个会吗
Oh, what meeting were you in?

320
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,280
我没有对他有敌意  我是在保护他
I wasn't antagonizing him. I was protecting him.

321
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,980
是吗
Oh, really?

322
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,050
把他的主意说得一文不值还激怒他就叫保护吗
By shitting all over his idea and then pissing him off?

323
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,450
我不在乎我们是不是激怒了他
I don't care if we pissed him off.

324
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,020
他不需要朋友
He doesn't need a friend.

325
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,010
他需要的是我们做好我们的律师工作
What he needs is for us to be great lawyers.

326
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,750
路易  你可是有过因为别人不尊重你的级别
Louis, you have a history of getting bent out of shape

327
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,160
而大发雷霆的黑历史  所以别跟我扯
over hierarchy, so don't tell me

328
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,720
这事和你的所作所为没关系
that has nothing to do with this.

329
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,960
好吧  迈克  你说得对
Okay, fine, Mike. You know what, you're right.

330
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,000
我当时确实很生气  仅仅是当时
I did get bent out of shape. Did.

331
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,390
但随后我立刻就克制住了  因为就像我说的
But then I got over it, because as I said,

332
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,810
客户至上
the client comes first.

333
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,130
你真指望我相信这话吗
You really expect me to believe that?

334
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,440
迈克  几年前  多米尼克90%的时间
Mike, a few years ago, Dominic spent 90% of his time

335
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,510
都在研究引擎
under the hood.

336
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,810
他之所以急于实现这件事
He is rushing into this

337
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,030
是因为他觉得这是他唯一的机会  你知道的
because he feels it's his only chance, and you know it.

338
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,640
你觉得哈维会不做尽职调查就同意这件事吗
You think Harvey would sign off on this without due diligence?

339
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,480
让我猜猜  你希望我来做所有的工作吗
And let me guess, you expect me to do all the work?

340
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,570
不  你做一半  我做一半
No, you take half, I take half.

341
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,760
我们齐心协力
We do the work together.

342
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,410
你没听清我说的话
Oh, you're not hearing me.

343
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,300
-我当然听清了  -不  你没听清
- Oh, I'm hearing you. - No, you're not.

344
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,230
我是代表迈克尔・乔丹打这个电话的
I'm calling on behalf of Michael Jordan.

345
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,230
我不管你是代表谁打的
I don't care who you're calling for.

346
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,720
我们那天已经被订出去了
We're booked on that date.

347
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,160
可你的助手金妮说  史密斯夫妇
Oh, but your assistant, Ginny, said that the Smiths

348
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,700
可能想要...
might be willing to, um--

349
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,480
首先  她叫帕特丽夏  不叫金妮
First of all, it's Patricia, not Ginny.

350
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,350
其次  是麦克米伦夫妇  不是史密斯夫妇
And it's the Mcmillans, not the Smiths.

351
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,960
所以如果你没有别的事...
So, if you don't have anything else, then--

352
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,110
要知道  我问你的事情是合情合理的
You know what? That was a legitimate question,

353
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,950
你要是不那么粗鲁就好了
and it would be nice if you weren't so rude.

354
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,380
所以你最好至少发本宣传册来
So the least you can do is messenger over a brochure,

355
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,270
因为如果你不发
because if you don't,

356
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,840
乔丹先生就会打电话给广场酒店经理
Mr. Jordan is gonna call the manager of the Plaza

357
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,470
让你丢了饭碗
and get your ass fired.

358
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,220
路易  我需要和你谈谈
Louis, I need to talk to you.

359
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,300
我正要去找你呢
I was just on my way to see you.

360
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,940
关于那起正在进行的环保署调查吗
About the pending EPA investigation?

361
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,320
-真见鬼  -我还以为你在得意呢
- Shit. - I thought you'd be gloating.

362
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,300
你不正希望这样吗
You're the one who wanted this.

363
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,820
我不是希望这样  我是担心这样
I didn't want this. I feared this.

364
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,130
如果多米尼克买下山脉科技
If Dominic buys Range Tech,

365
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,120
就会惹上大麻烦
he's in huge trouble.

366
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,560
而如果我们告诉他这件事还没有解决方案
And if we tell him that without having a solution,

367
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,260
他就会炒了我们
he'll fire us.

368
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,990
我就是要说这个  我有解决方案
That's the thing. I have a solution.

369
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,880
我找到一家公司  他们有蓄电池部门
I found a company that has a battery division

370
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,680
我们可以买下来
that we can buy.

371
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,740
我们只要去找他们然后...
Now, we just have to approach them and--

372
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,140
不行  你没听到我说的话吗
No. Did you not just hear what I said?

373
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,440
我们不能危及他的交易
We cannot jeopardize his deal.

374
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,420
如果我们能让他们签保密协议
We won't be jeopardizing it

375
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,270
就不会危及到他的交易
if we can get them to sign a nondisclosure agreement.

376
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,710
我们让他们那样做的前提是
And the only way we'll be able to get them to do that

377
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,580
他们是我们的客户
is if they're our client.

378
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,120
所以幸好他们确实是我们的客户
Well, then it's a good thing they are.

379
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,580
你在我们自己客户里找了一家
You found one of our own clients?

380
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,300
你真是个天才
You're a genius.

381
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,590
但有一个小问题
Yeah, there's only one problem.

382
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,750
他们是杰克・索罗夫的客户
They're Jack Soloff's client.

383
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,100
那别想了  我们得另找一家公司
Forget it, we need to find another company.

384
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,480
没有别的公司了
There is no other company.

385
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,810
迈克  索罗夫绝不可能
Mike, there is no way that Soloff

386
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,260
和我们合作的  他恨透我了
will work with us on this. He hates me.

387
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,170
那我们就得想个办法让他不再恨你
Then we have to find a way to make him un-hate you,

388
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,330
我告诉你  这笔交易对杰克和我们
because I'm telling you, this deal is good for Jack,

389
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,360
都有好处
and it is good for us.

390
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,980
肯定会有办法的
There has to be a way.

391
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,510
那你去和他谈
Well, then you talk to him.

392
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,480
你是说你想让我
Are you--are you saying you want me

393
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,230
一个人去和索罗夫谈判吗
to negotiate with Soloff on my own?

394
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,980
我是说我们是一个团队  而索罗夫
I'm saying we're a team, and there's a better chance

395
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,840
对你点头的概率比对我要大得多
of soloff saying yes to you than to me.

396
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,460
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

397
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,290
来领一份保密协议  你在这里干什么
I was just getting an NDA. What are you doing here?

398
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,470
我正在帮你呢
I am actually here for you.

399
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,160
我正在复印广场酒店的宣传册
I'm making copies of a brochure from the Plaza Hotel.

400
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,470
你搞定了吗
Wait, so you got it done?

401
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,960
没有  我给他们打电话
No, I called them,

402
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,820
他们表现得非常混蛋
and they were dicks,

403
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,050
反倒冲我发了一通火
And they got pissed at me.

404
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,170
所以你失败了吗
So you failed?

405
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,140
好吧
Okay.

406
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,390
如果你认为
If by "failed,"

407
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,130
我弄到了婚礼策划师
you mean I got the name

408
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,500
她的助手  和要举行婚礼那对夫妇的名字
of the wedding planner, her assistant,

409
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,330
还弄到了一本
the couple getting married,

410
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,110
印有他们抬头的宣传册  也算失败的话
and a brochure with their letterhead on it,

411
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,960
那么是的  迈克  我失败了
then, yeah, Mike, yeah, I failed.

412
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,170
唐娜  你确定你处理得了吧
Whoa, Donna, are you sure you can handle this?

413
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,550
你会跑去问一个大厨
Do you ask a chef who's cooking

414
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,330
他做的饭会不会好吃吗
if the meal's gonna turn out okay?

415
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,270
不会  你只管乖乖坐在那里
No, you sit back, you behave yourself

416
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,120
等着品尝你吃过的最美味的
until you get the best duck à l'orange

417
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,200
法式橙汁鸭胸
you've ever tasted.

418
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,250
我其实并不喜欢带橙汁的鸭肉
Yeah, I don't really like duck with orange stuff.

419
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,470
-出去  -我出去了
- Get out. - Gone.

420
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,030
我喜欢你做事的方式
I like the way you operate.

421
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,280
抱歉你说什么
Excuse me?

422
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,230
永远不让他们看到你担心冒汗
Never let them see you sweat.

423
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,730
你为什么觉得我在冒汗
What makes you think I'm sweating?

424
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,050
我看出来了
My eyes.

425
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,100
你或许能用那比喻哄骗那位小菜鸟
You may have fooled opie with that metaphor,

426
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,090
可你我都明白你现在连狗屁鸡胸都没有
but we both know you got duck à la shit.

427
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,360
新来的丫头  我不知道你以为你在和谁说话
Okay, new girl, I don't know who you think you're talking to,

428
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,710
可姐就是干这个的
but this is what I do.

429
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,280
你就是干这个的
What you do.

430
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,760
我干这行的时候
I've been doing shit like this

431
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,580
你还没出生呢
since you was an itch in your daddy's pants.

432
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,670
等等  你是在引用《致命凶器》[电影]吗
Hang on, did you just quote Lethal Weapon to me?

433
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,540
你听出来啦
You got that?

434
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,080
看来你还是有点智商的
Maybe you do have something.

435
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,220
下厨愉快  红发小美女
Good luck with your duck, red.

436
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,630
塔尔先生  你在巴特勒交易所工作多久了
Mr. Tull, how long have you been working at butler trading?

437
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,030
将近三年了
Almost three years.

438
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,420
那么在此期间
And how much money have you made

439
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,790
你为他们的客户赚到了多少钱
for their clients over that time?

440
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,450
大约一亿五千万美金
Approximately $150 million.

441
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,360
我直说了吧
So let me get this straight.

442
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,590
你交易  赔钱  他们并未干涉
You made a trade, lost money, they did nothing.

443
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,330
但当他们发现要为此支付罚金时
But the day they find out that they have to pay a fine,

444
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,960
又站出来说你没有得到许可
they said you were acting alone

445
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,550
并打算为此送你进监狱
and they're letting you go to jail?

446
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,530
没错
Exactly.

447
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,510
你怎么知道他们许可了你的交易呢
And how do you know they signed off on your trade?

448
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,980
因为大家都知道他们许可每一单交易
Because everyone knows that they sign off on every trade.

449
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,430
那么最终  谁该为
And, ultimately, who would be responsible

450
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,220
结束一个违反规定的交易负责呢
for stopping a trade that violated regulations?

451
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,150
保罗・吉尔罗伊
Paul Gilroy.

452
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,090
所以不可能是你明知道自己在犯错
So it couldn't possibly be that you knew what you were doing,

453
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,870
还是隐瞒下来  而其实一切都是你的错吗
you kept it secret, and that all of this is your fault?

454
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,610
可能  但事实并非如此
It could be, but it isn't.

455
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,770
真有意思
Well, that's interesting,

456
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,690
因为有人可以证明确实如此
Because we have somebody who says it is.

457
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,720
谁能证明
And who the hell is that?

458
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,180
-塔尔先生的心理医生  -什么
- Mr. Tull's therapist. - What?

459
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,240
心理医生不能透露和患者的对话
A therapist can't testify against their own patient.

460
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,030
如果付钱的是我们  他也签了弃权书就可以
She can if we paid for it and he signed a waiver,

461
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,750
他也签了
Which he did.

462
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,300
{\an8}保拉・阿加德

463
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,420
塔尔先生  你的心理医生将提供证词
Mr. Tull, your therapist's testimony is coming,

464
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,090
到那时  你连交易资格都会丧失
and when it does, your ability to cut a deal goes away.

465
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,400
现在撤诉
Drop this matter,

466
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,800
没人会知道你看过心理医生
and no one ever knows you saw a therapist at all.

467
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,200
你去看公司提供的心理医生
You went to see a company-provided therapist,

468
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,430
为什么不告诉我
and you never told me?

469
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,610
我不知道这有关系
I didn't think it mattered.

470
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,130
关系大了去了
Well, it goddamn does.

471
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,690
你有告诉她是你干的吗
Did you tell this woman you did this?

472
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,170
没有  因为不是我干的
No, because I didn't do this.

473
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,340
但他们肯定不会是为此让她作证的
Well, they're not bringing her in to testify to that.

474
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,010
我跟她说我觉得愧疚
I told her that I felt guilty,

475
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,890
好像是我的错一样
as if the whole thing was my fault.

476
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,970
但我没说过是
I never said it was.

477
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,040
还不如说了呢
Well, you might as well have,

478
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,310
因为你这话谁听都会觉得就是你的错
because that's what it's gonna sound like.

479
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,090
-哈维  -你怎么能这么蠢
- Harvey-- - How could you be so stupid

480
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,340
居然向个陌生人敞开心扉
to confide your feelings to a stranger?

481
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,710
因为我需要帮助
Because I needed help.

482
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,040
如果你不讲出自己的真实感觉
And if you're not gonna talk about your feelings,

483
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,070
那还不如不去看心理医生呢
you might as well not see a therapist at all.

484
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,780
你最好希望监狱里也有心理医生
You better hope there are therapists in prison,

485
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,370
因为如果我不能阻止她作证
because if I can't stop her from testifying,

486
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,870
那监狱就是你的归宿
that's where you're gonna end up.

487
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,420
迈克・罗斯  什么风把你吹来了
Mike Ross, what brings you down to my office?

488
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,080
我是来代路易向你提议的
I'm here with a proposal from Louis.

489
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,860
你来是因为路易需要我的帮忙
You're here because Louis wants something from me,

490
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,500
但他自己不敢开口
but he's too afraid to ask.

491
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,220
他不是不敢
He's not afraid.

492
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,060
他让我来只是因为他觉得
He just sent me here because he figured

493
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,480
让我跟你谈会更好
you might hear it better coming from me.

494
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,070
麦肯诺汽车公司想在
Mckernon Motors wants to make an investment

495
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,840
电池技术方面做投资
in battery technology.

496
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,050
我们想和田中协商一下
We'd like to quietly negotiate with Tanaka,

497
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,030
需要你帮助我们说服他签这个
and we need your help getting them to sign this.

498
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,140
我为什么要那么做
And why would I do that?

499
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,430
因为投资是一大笔钱
Because it's huge money,

500
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,240
而且现在律所又有了提成奖励
and now that contingent compensation is back at the firm,

501
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,480
那对你也是一大笔钱
it's huge money for you.

502
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,820
上次路易给我的这种提议
And the last time Louis came to me with an offer like this,

503
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,750
完全就是个骗局
it was bullshit.

504
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,200
我不是路易  这也不是骗局
Well, I'm not Louis, and this isn't bullshit.

505
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,420
那我只有一个问题了
Then I guess I just have one question.

506
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,420
你能给我多少分成
How much of the deal are you authorized to give away?

507
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,430
五成  这已经够高了
50%, and that's more than fair.

508
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,060
也许是高  但我要全部
Maybe it is, but I want all of it.

509
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,480
你知道这对你的委托人也有好处  对吧
You know this helps your client, right?

510
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,620
我不在乎  要么全部要么免谈
I don't give a shit. All of it or none of it.

511
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,630
那就免谈
It's gonna be none of it,

512
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,650
而且你这完全是在往外扔钱
and you're just taking money out of your own pocket.

513
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,540
我不在意  因为这与钱无关
I don't care, because this isn't about money.

514
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,830
这是私仇  你走吧
It's about getting even, so run along.

515
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,880
告诉路易除非全部酬金都给我
Go tell Louis I'm not lifting a finger to help him

516
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,510
否则我决不帮他
unless I get everything.

517
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,250
你还真是个混蛋
Wow, you really are a dick.

518
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,180
我想这说明你听懂我的意思了
I take it that means you know where I stand.

519
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,140
杰西卡  你好  有什么能为你效劳的
Jessica, hi. What can I do for you?

520
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,510
婚礼筹划的如何了
How's the wedding planning going?

521
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,890
我们还在找婚礼办场
Oh, well, we're still looking for a venue,

522
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,160
但一切都很顺利
but things are moving along.

523
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,690
我听说这个阶段情侣经常吵架呢
I hear a lot of couples fight during this time.

524
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,920
我刚好有个够聪明的未婚夫
Well, I happen to have a fiance who's smart enough

525
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,880
让我全权负责了
to leave everything to me.

526
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,020
但你来不是为了这个
But that is not why you're here.

527
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,130
我想知道哈维情况如何
I want to know how Harvey's doing.

528
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,320
你是说案子的情况吗
With our case?

529
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,170
不  我问的就是他的情况
No, I just want to know how he's doing.

530
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,780
他很好
He's doing fine.

531
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,920
替我看着他
Keep an eye on him.

532
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
我会的
I will.

533
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,960
你来做什么
What are you doing here?

534
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,530
你明天要来我办公室
You're coming to my offices tomorrow

535
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,720
指证我的客户  你却不告诉我
to testify against my client and you didn't tell me?

536
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,360
我没告诉你是因为
I didn't tell you because this is the first

537
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,470
这是我头一次听说这事
I'm hearing about it.

538
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,900
胡扯  我都看到了
Bullshit, I saw it.

539
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,160
你收到了传票  要指证山姆・塔尔
You got subpoenaed to testify against Sam Tull.

540
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,620
在你冲进来之前
And until you just burst in here,

541
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,330
我根本不知道他是你的委托人
I had no idea he was your client.

542
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,180
无所谓了  因为你不能去
Well, it doesn't matter because you're not showing up.

543
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,090
那他们要逮捕我你也拦得住是吗
And you're going to stop them from arresting me, are you?

544
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,720
因为如果不去  我就会被逮捕
Because that's what will happen if I don't.

545
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,140
那就找个我这样的律师帮你解决这事
Then get yourself someone like me and get out of it.

546
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,920
那我告诉你
For your information,

547
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,740
我咨询过三个律师了
I have been to three different men like you,

548
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,470
因为我在乎山姆
because I care about Sam,

549
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,670
而且你比我更清楚
and you know better than I do

550
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,670
他一旦签了弃权书  我就别无选择
that once he signed that release, I have no choice.

551
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,400
我有办法给你选择
Well, I have a way to get you out of it,

552
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,560
你必须这么做
and you're gonna do it.

553
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,010
他们要是问你一些可能害他进监狱的问题
They ask you something that's gonna send him to jail,

554
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,730
你就说谎
you lie.

555
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,680
我不能这么做
I can't do that.

556
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,840
你能  你也会  他们不会知道的
You can, and you will, and they'll never know.

557
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,690
可我知道
I'll know.

558
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,170
就算我骗人骗己  还有记录呢
And even if I didn't, I have notes,

559
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,350
要是被他们发现  我就会进监狱
and if they found those, I'd be going to jail.

560
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,210
那就销毁记录  因为他是无辜的
Then destroy them, because he's innocent,

561
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,980
而且他那么信任你
and he trusted you with everything.

562
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,580
如果这对你不重要
And if that doesn't mean something to you,

563
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,360
那别人凭什么还要信任你
then why the hell should anyone ever trust you with anything?

564
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,170
哈维  这事和我们的事无关
Harvey, this isn't about us.

565
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,210
没人能逼我这么对你
No one can ever make me do that to you.

566
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,130
我想山姆・塔尔也是这么想的
I'm sure Sam Tull thought the same thing.

567
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,330
怎么样
Well?

568
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,420
没用的
It's not gonna work.

569
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,330
他拒绝了
He said no?

570
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,150
他说他要全部提成
He said he wants 100% of the deal.

571
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,070
-鬼扯  -我知道
- Piece of shit. - I know.

572
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,090
所以
So...

573
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,340
不知道  得另想他法了
I don't know. We're gonna have to think of something else.

574
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,110
给他吧
Give it to him.

575
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,490
-什么  -我说给他
- What? - I said give it to him.

576
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,100
路易  我知道多米尼克的案子
Louis, hey, I know we're under the gun

577
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,730
让我们压力很大  但我真的不觉得
with this Dominic thing, but I really don't think

578
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,540
放任他这样耍你是个好主意
it's a good idea to let him push you around like that.

579
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,270
我没放任他耍我
I'm not letting him push me around.

580
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,970
我是在听从指引
I'm listening to my leader.

581
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,510
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

582
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,000
还记得吗  你问我新路易来自哪里
Remember when you asked me where the new Louis was coming from

583
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,880
我说是从自我中诞生的
and I told you from me?

584
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,000
其实不是
It wasn't from me.

585
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,610
是杰西卡
It was from Jessica.

586
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,700
她让我别再小气
She asked me to stop the pettiness once and for all.

587
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,660
如果我现在做不到  以后也永远做不到
And if I can't do that now, I'll never be able to do it.

588
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,640
好吧  看来我们只需要
Okay, then I guess all we have to do

589
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,330
想办法说服田中了
is figure out a way to sell the idea to Tanaka.

590
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,340
相信我
Oh, trust me.

591
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,410
这我都能做到  那个就是小菜一碟了
If I can do this, I definitely can do that.

592
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,230
路易  你干了什么啊
Louis, what the hell have you done?

593
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,890
怎么了  我在准备与田中的会面
What? I'm setting up for our meeting with Tanaka.

594
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,830
你逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

595
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,060
这又不是《打工好汉》
This isn't Gung Ho.

596
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,700
路易  他们看到你这样
Louis, they're gonna take one look at you,

597
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,830
肯定会被吓跑的
they're gonna run out the door.

598
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,940
不会的
No, they're not.

599
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,570
迈克  田中是个看重传统的日本公司
Mike, Tanaka's a Japanese company steeped in tradition.

600
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,100
我不管你怎么看待他们
I don't care what you think they are.

601
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,200
这太无礼了
This is offensive.

602
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,540
尊重他国文化
There's absolutely nothing offensive

603
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,170
绝对不是一种冒犯
about showing respect for another culture.

604
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,470
你又懂什么日本文化呢
And what do you know about their culture?

605
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,890
迈克  相信我
Mike, trust me.

606
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,020
我上初中的时候
When I was in junior high,

607
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,970
学校有个交换生
we had an exchange student stay with us.

608
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,100
优琪
Ooh, Suki.

609
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,100
又来了
Here we go.

610
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,020
她远离家乡
She was far from home

611
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,120
非常自豪于自己的文化
and proud of her culture,

612
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,380
她在屋里做了很多那种布置
and she set up everything in this room

613
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,560
好让自己觉得舒服
to make herself feel comfortable,

614
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,830
包括她送给我爸的这件和服
right down to giving my father this very kimono

615
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,440
和她画的家乡地图
and laying out a map of her hometown.

616
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,560
路易  听我说
Louis, I want you to listen to me.

617
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,540
他们45分钟后就到了
They are gonna be here in 45 minutes,

618
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,020
如果你还穿成这样
and if you are still dressed like that

619
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,690
这间屋子也还是这个布置
and this room still looks like this,

620
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,790
多米尼克一定会炒了我们
Dominic is going to fire us.

621
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,840
他们不会45分钟后到
They're not gonna be here in 45 minutes,

622
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,050
因为他们已经到了
'cause they're here right now.

623
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,680
田中先生先生
Mr. Tanaka-san.

624
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,170
这是谁布置的
Who did this?

625
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,320
我
I did.

626
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,220
那是四国的地图
That is a map of Shikoku.

627
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,260
是我的家乡
My family is from there.

628
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,490
我知道
I know.

629
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,420
你怎么知道
How?

630
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,950
因为我们做足了功课  先生
Because we do our homework, sir,

631
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,520
正如我们也做足了这笔交易的功课
Just like we did our homework on this deal.

632
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,010
我想我们会相处得非常愉快
I think we are going to get along very nicely.

633
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,020
请坐
Please.

634
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,710
愣着干嘛
What are you doing?

635
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,820
端茶去
Get the tea.

636
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,160
-你让我...  -没错  端茶
- You want-- - Yeah, get the tea.

637
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,270
好吧
Okay.

638
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,850
两位一定就是未来的麦克米伦夫妇了
Oh, you must be the future Mcmillans.

639
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,690
我该说抱歉来晚了  但其实我不是很抱歉
I would say sorry I'm late, but I am not sorry.

640
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,290
我们开始讨论你们
So let us begin discussing the details

641
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,740
第一次婚礼的事宜吧
of your first wedding.

642
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,350
抱歉  请问你是
I'm sorry. You are?

643
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,780
我的名字无关紧要啦
Oh, my name is of no consequence.

644
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,070
重要的是  我们公司已经接手了
What is, is that my company has taken over

645
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,760
纽约广场酒店的婚礼策划事宜
the planning service of the Plaza Hotel.

646
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,430
这是我们的宣传单
Here's our brochure.

647
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,050
从你们脸上的表情可以看出
Mm, I can see by the look on your faces

648
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,960
那个白痴帕特丽夏还没告诉你们吧
that bitch Patricia, she did not tell you.

649
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,100
白痴
Bitch?

650
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,760
我们还挺喜欢帕特丽夏的
We love Patricia.

651
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,200
反正她已经被开除了
Well, she's no longer with us.

652
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,130
如我所说  菜单不能随意选择了
As I was saying, the menu will no longer be optional.

653
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,870
我们只能上鲜橙烩鸭  法式蜗牛
We'll be serving duck a l'orange, escargot,

654
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,100
还有鹅肝酱
and foie gras.

655
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,390
但我们是素食主义者
But we're vegan.

656
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,650
什么意思
What is that?

657
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,950
-就是  -无所谓了
- It's-- - It doesn't matter.

658
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,190
我们是法式餐厅
We are French.

659
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,360
要么吃我们上的菜  要么就别吃
You eat what we serve, or you do not eat.

660
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,040
我们能试吃吗
Can we taste it?

661
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,050
你说在你带我去吃晚饭  和我上床前
Oh, would you like me to just show you my naked body

662
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,570
要不要我先脱掉衣服让你验货
before we go out to dinner and you want to sleep with me?

663
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,660
我要去下洗手间
I need to go to the restroom.

664
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,170
好的  我们这么办吧
Okay, so here's what's gonna happen.

665
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,370
她肯定不想要我了
She's gonna want to drop me,

666
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,930
然后你们就放弃纽约广场酒店吧
and you're gonna drop the plaza hotel.

667
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,450
-什么  -别装了  约翰
- What? - Cut the shit, John.

668
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,550
我这么做都是为了给你个台阶
I did that so you could have some cover.

669
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,260
我调查过了
I did some checking,

670
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,430
你们要么更换举办婚礼的地点
and you either need to change the location of your wedding,

671
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,630
要么我就告诉她你有情妇的事
or I'm gonna tell her about your mistress.

672
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,170
是的
Yeah.

673
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,480
阿加德医生  山姆・塔尔是何时找你就医的
Dr. Agard, when did Sam Tull start seeing you as a patient?

674
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,070
大约六个月前
Approximately six months ago.

675
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,750
他为什么去找你
And why did he start seeing you?

676
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,660
他说他的工作包含着风险
He said his job involved taking risks,

677
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,210
让他压力过大
and it was causing him stress.

678
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,470
所以他是不想继续冒险了吗
So he wanted to stop taking risks?

679
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,130
不  他想要继续
No, he wanted to continue.

680
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,730
我懂了
Oh, I get it.

681
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,520
他想要继续冒风险
He wanted to continue with the risks,

682
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,150
他只是希望心里能好过点
he just wanted to feel better about it.

683
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,010
是的
Yes.

684
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,930
那你有帮助他对于冒险
And were you able to help him feel better

685
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,460
获得心理安慰吗
about taking these risks?

686
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,140
情况是有改善
Um, uh, we made progress.

687
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,360
-请回答是或不是  -是
- Yes or no? - Yes.

688
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,800
那么在你帮助他获得心理安慰后
And after you helped him feel good about taking risks,

689
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,410
他有没有告诉你他一笔交易损失了五千万
did he reveal that he then lost $50 million on one trade?

690
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,930
阿加德医生  你受誓言制约的
Dr. Agard, you are under oath.

691
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,390
如果你不回答
And if you will not answer,

692
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,800
我会请法官强迫你回答
I will have a judge compel you to answer.

693
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,780
有
Yes.

694
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,770
那他关于一笔交易就损失五千万
And how did he say he felt about losing $50 million

695
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,940
是什么心情
on one trade?

696
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,780
他说他觉得愧疚
He said he felt guilty about it.

697
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,440
所以他来找你  好让自己继续冒险
So he came to you to continue taking risks

698
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,550
直到他损失了五千万
until he finally lost $50 million

699
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,820
然后他承认自己有罪
and then admitted to being guilty.

700
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,050
她不是这么说的
That is not what she said.

701
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,980
抱歉  他是有负罪感
I'm sorry, he just felt guilty.

702
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,860
你是想现在就放弃起诉
You want to drop this now,

703
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,470
还是要我把这录音送交证监会
or do you want us to hand this tape over to the SEC?

704
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,740
阿加德医生  刚才的指证是你自愿的吗
Dr. Agard, did you want to give the testimony you just gave?

705
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,470
-当然不是  -为什么
- Of course not. - And why is that?

706
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,790
因为我在乎我的病人
Because I care about my clients.

707
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,360
有没有可能你不愿意
Is it possible that you didn't want to give it

708
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,790
是因为这不是真的
because it's not true?

709
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,170
当然不可能
No, it's not possible.

710
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,760
你不可能会在被迫的情况下
You couldn't possibly have been pressured

711
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,970
做出违背你意愿的证言吗
to give false testimony against your wishes?

712
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,830
不  我不会
No, I couldn't have.

713
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,090
你之前有没有因为受到客户压力
Have you ever been pressured to do something

714
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,470
而做出过违背你意愿的事
you didn't want to do by a client before?

715
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,110
请允许我换个说法
Let me rephrase.

716
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,970
你允许一个你在乎的病人离开了戒毒所
Isn't it true that you released a client that you cared about

717
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,880
就因为受到了
from rehab for no reason

718
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,720
来自另一个雇佣你的客户的压力
other than you felt pressure from a different client

719
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,460
这是不是真的
who was actually paying the bills?

720
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,690
阿加德医生  你受誓言制约
Dr. Agard, you're under oath,

721
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,930
如果你不回答
and if you will not answer,

722
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,330
我会请法官强迫你回答
I will have a judge compel you to answer.

723
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,330
是真的
Yes.

724
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,030
这个人是否在不到24小时的时间里
And did this person die of an overdose

725
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,830
因为吸毒过量死亡了
less than 24 hours later?

726
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,070
是的
Yes.

727
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,000
如果关乎人命的事情
So if you let yourself be pressured

728
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,250
你都能屈从于压力
when someone's life is at risk,

729
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,510
我们怎么能知道
what's to make us think you're not doing

730
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,280
现在就并非这种情况呢
the exact same thing right now?

731
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,270
你这个自大的混蛋
You arrogant piece of shit.

732
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,040
说话小心点  这是我办公室
Watch yourself. This is my office.

733
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,460
我才不在乎
Well, I don't care what it is.

734
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,880
你怎么可以这样背叛我
How dare you betray me like that?

735
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,840
-我提醒过你  -你不是提醒我
- I tried to warn you. - You didn't warn me.

736
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,780
你要我为你说谎  我拒绝了
You asked me to lie for you, and I told you I wouldn't.

737
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,830
我是要你为山姆・塔尔说谎
I asked you to lie for Sam Tull--

738
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,940
这事与山姆・塔尔无关  你也清楚
This isn't about Sam Tull, and you know it.

739
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,160
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

740
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,940
我向你敞开心扉是为了和你建立信任
I opened up to you so that we could build trust,

741
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,700
不是为了让你羞辱我的
not so that you could humiliate me.

742
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,380
我羞辱你是为了帮助一个
I humiliated you to help a man

743
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,690
你说你很在乎的人
you say you care about.

744
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,760
所以跟我们关于你母亲而吵的架
And our fighting about your mother

745
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,940
一点关系都没有吗
had nothing to do with that?

746
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,520
-你说什么  -你咨询一半的时候走掉
- Excuse me? - You walked out of our session

747
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,420
是因为你不想谈你的母亲
because you didn't want to talk about your mother.

748
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,250
而且一有机会给你破坏
And the second you had the chance

749
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,680
我们的关系  你立刻就抓住了
to permanently damage our relationship, you took it.

750
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,610
你简直疯了
You're insane.

751
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,390
而你是个自私自利的自恋狂
And you're a self-serving narcissist

752
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,370
为了得到自己想要的东西不择手段
who will do or say anything to get what he wants.

753
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,320
我的所做所为只是为了保护我的客户
I did what I did in there to protect my client.

754
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,620
我才不在乎是不是伤害了你的感情
And I don't give a shit if it hurt your feelings or not,

755
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,760
因为你对他的背叛
because you betrayed him

756
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,430
和我对你的背叛没有两样
just as much as I'm betraying you.

757
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,600
你只是因此哭闹
And you may be the one who's crying about it,

758
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,330
但他却要被强加上罪名了
but he's the one who's been accused of committing a crime.

759
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,060
如果你够幸运  有天你会明白
If you're lucky, someday you're gonna realize

760
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,800
现在到底是什么情况  那天到来时
what's really going on here, and when that day comes,

761
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,220
我希望你能找到能帮你的人
I hope you find someone to help you,

762
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,870
因为那人绝不会是我
because it isn't going to be me.

763
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,720
麦克  把咖啡放下来看看这个
Mike, put that coffee down and check this out.

764
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,220
这是斯卡斯代尔的地图  我长大的地方
It's a map of scarsdale-- where I grew up.

765
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,760
田中的回礼
Tanaka returned the favor.

766
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,450
其实  路易  这是我送的
Actually, Louis, I got that for you.

767
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,590
是你  为什么
You did? Why?

768
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,590
因为你是对的  而我错了
Because you were right and I was wrong,

769
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,480
而且虽然听起来疯狂
and as crazy as it seems,

770
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,490
但你我其实合作得还挺好的
you and I actually make a pretty good team.

771
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,360
万事俱备  只差让多米尼克安排见面了
Now all that's left is calling Dominic to set up a meeting.

772
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,430
不如你去吧
Why don't you do it?

773
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,450
我没空
I can't.

774
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,750
我要去把我的地图挂起来
I got to go hang my map.

775
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,340
多米尼克  你在这儿干嘛
Dominic, what are you doing here?

776
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,880
我正想打给你呢
I was just about to call you.

777
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,220
说什么  说你把我的单子搞砸了
To say what, that you blew up my deal?

778
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,770
-我已经知道了  -什么
- Because I already know. - What?

779
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,760
是的  山脉科技在他们听说
That's right. Range Tech called me after they heard

780
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,490
我在跟另一家公司接洽时就联系我了
that I was negotiating with another company.

781
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,430
问题是  我就没在跟另一家公司谈
Problem is, I wasn't negotiating with another company.

782
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,870
谈的是我的律师  还没经过我同意
My lawyers were without my consent.

783
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,270
好的  镇定  多米尼克
Okay, calm down, Dominic.

784
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,720
山脉科技那边有问题
There was a problem with Range Tech.

785
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,710
我说过我不想听到有问题
I told you that I didn't want there to be any problems!

786
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,750
要是你买了他们
Well, if you'd bought them,

787
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,890
他们的问题就变成你的问题了
their problems were gonna become your problems.

788
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,770
你就冷静下来想一想
But just calm down and take a second,

789
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,370
因为我们有解决方案
because we brought you a solution.

790
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,180
什么方案
Which is what?

791
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,470
麦克  别打给多米尼克  田中退出了
Mike, don't call Dominic. Tanaka pulled out.

792
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,090
退出什么
Pulled out of what?

793
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,480
不重要了
It doesn't matter.

794
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,070
你们俩都被开除了
You're both fired.

795
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,510
-哈维  有事找你  -不方便  瑞秋
- Harvey, I need to talk to you. - Not now, Rachel.

796
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,450
-山姆・塔尔被捕了  -什么
- Sam Tull's been arrested. - What?

797
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,070
吉尔罗伊的律师向证监会提交了正式通知
Gilroy's lawyer gave formal notice to the SEC.

798
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,620
不管怎样他们都不用付罚金了
They won't pay the fine under any circumstance.

799
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,560
妈的
God damn it.

800
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,410
格雷琴  打给保罗・吉尔罗伊
Gretchen, get Paul Gilroy on the phone.

801
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,390
哈维  你准备怎么做
Harvey, what are you gonna do?

802
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,510
塔尔不能因为这个坐牢啊
Tull can't go to prison for this.

803
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,330
-没人会坐牢  -你怎么保证
- No one's going to prison. - But how do you know that?

804
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,020
我们之前还没想到他会被捕呢
We didn't think he'd be arrested in the first place.

805
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,020
我不管我们之前是怎么想的
I don't care what we thought.

806
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,110
我不让这件事发生  它就不会发生
It's not gonna happen because I'm not letting it happen.

807
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,370
吉尔罗伊先生接入了一号线
I've got Mr. Gilroy on Line one.

808
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,720
你疯了吗  竟然联系了证监会
Are you out of your mind? You contacted the SEC?

809
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,100
是他们联系的我
They contacted me.

810
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,810
提起恶意诉讼的人可不是我
And I'm not the one who filed a malicious prosecution lawsuit.

811
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,390
不  但你是那个取证的时候死的很惨
No, you're the one who got his ass kicked

812
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,800
然后还敢再回来讨更多打的人
in a deposition then turned around and asked for more.

813
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,040
我没有输得很惨  斯佩克特先生
I didn't get my ass kicked, Mr. Specter.

814
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,790
惨的是那个心理医生  她已经不跟我们合作了
That idiot therapist did, and she no longer works for us.

815
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,310
可你还是没有证据说那些交易
But you still don't have any proof

816
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,690
是我授权的  并且你以后也不会有
that I authorized those trades, and you never will.

817
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,670
所以我建议你别再骚扰我了
So I suggest you stop harassing me

818
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:19,090
好好去想怎么把你的客户从牢里捞出来吧
and focus on getting your client out of jail.

819
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,210
你听到他说的了
You heard the man.

820
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,370
我们要放弃吗
We're dropping the lawsuit?

821
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,880
不  我们要把损害赔偿翻倍
No, we're doubling the damages.

822
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,980
搞定它
Get it done.

823
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,870
你个混蛋  你设计我们
You son of a bitch. You set us up.

824
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,530
抱歉  路易  我不知道你在说什么
I'm sorry, Louis, I have no idea what you're talking about.

825
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,180
放屁  是你跟田中说别交易的
Oh, bullshit. You told Tanaka not to make a deal.

826
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,020
是我说的
Yes, I did.

827
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,310
这开始听着像个好主意
At first, it looked like a good idea,

828
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,900
但后来我做了尽职调查
but then I did my due diligence,

829
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,750
你瞅瞅  就发现这主意不咋地啊
and lo and behold, it didn't.

830
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,420
在你把会议透给山脉科技前还是之后
Was that before or after you leaked our meeting to Range Tech?

831
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,770
不得不说  我很震惊
I have to say, I'm appalled.

832
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,640
在我和你做了这么多
I mean, after you've been so aboveboard

833
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,160
正大光明的交易之后
in all your dealings with me,

834
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,000
你居然认为我会在你背后捅刀子
to think that I would go behind your back

835
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,460
在没有任何证据指向我的情况下
and leak news of that meeting with no possible chance

836
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,300
说我走漏了会议消息  这想法简直是侮辱
of it being linked back to me, that's really offensive.

837
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,990
它能指向你  逻辑一清二楚
It is linked back to you, plain as day.

838
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,060
那我猜你们俩肯定是证据充足了
Then I guess you two must have some sort of proof,

839
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,140
要是你们没有
because if you don't,

840
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,810
那就请滚出我的办公室
you can walk yourselves the hell out of my office.

841
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,810
跟我斗是一回事
It's one thing for you to have your feud with me,

842
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,380
但你刚刚让你的律所失去了一块肥肉
but you just cost your firm a huge piece of business.

843
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,640
我来跟你解释一下  这话我也跟他讲过
Let me explain to you what I already told him.

844
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,610
这无关生意  而在于一报还一报
This isn't about business. It's about getting even.

845
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,680
哈维  你现在有空吗
Harvey, do you have a minute?

846
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,590
如果你是来劝我放弃反诉的...
If you're here to tell me to drop that countersuit--

847
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,250
我不是来劝你放弃什么的
I'm not telling you to drop anything.

848
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,350
我只是说除了攻击吉尔罗伊
I'm just saying in addition to attacking Gilroy,

849
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,570
我们还应该找证据来证明山姆对那些交易
we should be getting proof that Sam got the authorization

850
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,440
是有授权的
for those trades.

851
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,500
我们没有证据
We don't have any proof.

852
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,070
我们可以  如果能让其他交易员
We can if we get some of the other traders

853
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,500
站出来作证就行
to come forward and say how it went.

854
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,720
他们绝不会作证的
They'll never testify to that.

855
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,240
哈维  那个医师是公司医师
Harvey, that therapist was the company therapist.

856
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,220
那些交易员定期去见她
Those traders saw her on a regular basis

857
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,320
来保证自己精神正常
to keep their shit together.

858
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,200
所以如果山姆跟她谈了工作
So, if Sam opened up to her about work,

859
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,030
其他交易员肯定也说过
then some of the other traders must have too.

860
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,610
她不能说出来
She can't speak to that.

861
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,960
当然可以
Of course she can.

862
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,750
塔尔放弃了医患保密权  其他人肯定也是
If Tull waived privilege, then they all did.

863
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,510
你很清楚
You know that.

864
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,090
那不重要  你也知道我对她做了什么
It doesn't matter. You saw what I did to her.

865
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,080
她不会愿意帮我们的
She's not gonna want to help us.

866
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,300
那不是帮我们  是帮她的患者
It's not about helping us. It's about helping her client.

867
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,510
我不能要求她那么做
I can't ask her to do that.

868
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,530
-为什么  -就是不能
- Why not? - Because I can't.

869
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,000
-哈维  到底怎么回事  -没什么
- Harvey, what's going on? - Nothing's going on.

870
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,420
取证会上她那些事  你怎么知道的
How did you know those things about her in that deposition?

871
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,340
就是知道了
Because I did.

872
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,630
这跟你有恐慌症
Does it have something to do with the fact

873
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,810
而她是你的治疗师这事
that you've been having panic attacks

874
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,950
有关系吗
and that she's your therapist?

875
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,360
-如果有  -我们的对话到此为止
- Because if it does-- - This conversation is over.

876
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,380
我不是想插手什么
Look, I am not trying to butt into things

877
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,210
跟我没关系的事  但这事与你无关
that don't concern me, but this isn't about you.

878
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,620
关系的是不让山姆・塔尔进监狱
This is about keeping Sam Tull out of prison.

879
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,410
你们来这里做什么
What the hell are you doing here?

880
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,440
你俩已经不为我工作了
You two don't work for me anymore.

881
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,650
给我们一分钟解释一下
Just give us a minute to explain.

882
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,850
没什么可解释的
There's nothing to explain.

883
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,690
你们搞砸了我的交易  毁了我的友谊
You blew up my deal and ruined a friendship

884
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,020
就因为你们自以为比我懂的多
because you thought you knew better than me.

885
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,090
我们是比你懂的多
We do know better than you.

886
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,580
你就是个自大的混蛋
You're an arrogant son of a bitch.

887
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,120
多米尼克  这是一份集体诉讼的草稿
Dominic, this is a draft of a class-action lawsuit

888
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,340
被告是山脉科技
headed Range Tech's way

889
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,770
环保局报告一出就会提起
the second the EPA's report comes out.

890
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,500
就是你朋友一直雪藏的那份报告
That's the same report that your friend kept buried.

891
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,500
你要买下他们
And if you'd bought them,

892
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,880
诉讼就是告你了
that suit would have been headed your way.

893
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,070
所以没错  我们是搞砸了你的交易
So, yes, we blew up the deal,

894
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,130
但那人从来不是你的朋友
but that man was never your friend.

895
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,300
你骗了我  而更糟的是
You lied to me, and worse than that,

896
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,470
你不尊重我
you didn't respect me.

897
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,560
对不起  我不该跟你对抗
I am sorry. I shouldn't have antagonized you.

898
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,430
我也不该说不做尽职调查
And I shouldn't have said that rushing through this deal

899
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,160
就快速完成交易是可行的
without doing due diligence was feasible.

900
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,790
重点是  在考虑跟田中交易这事上
You see, the bottom line is, is that we were both right

901
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,300
我们俩都是对的
when we tried to do this deal with Tanaka.

902
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,280
现在我们没什么可对你遮掩的了
And now that we've got nothing to hide from you,

903
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,970
我们会克服一切困难帮你找到别的卖主
there is nothing to stop us from finding you someone else.

904
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,050
那你们与其在这里拍我马屁
So, instead of standing here kissing my ass,

905
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,730
不如赶紧着手去办吧
why don't you get to work doing that?

906
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,810
如果你是来道歉的  那我没兴趣
If you're here to apologize, I'm not interested.

907
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,050
我不是来道歉的
I'm not here to apologize.

908
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,270
我来是因为我需要看你的记录
I'm here because I need to look at your files.

909
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,380
你的自大还真是没有上限
There really is no end to your arrogance.

910
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,580
这是唯一能避免山姆入狱的办法
I wouldn't ask if this wasn't

911
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,520
否则我不会来求你的
the only way to keep Sam out of prison.

912
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,130
我不会给你山姆・塔尔的档案
I'm not giving you Sam Tull's file.

913
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,330
我要的也不是他的
And I'm not asking for it.

914
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,130
我要看你见的其他所有交易员的
I want to see all the files of the other traders you saw.

915
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,250
你是疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

916
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,650
我没有  他们都签了跟山姆那样的弃权书
No, I'm not. They all signed the same waiver Sam did.

917
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,570
肯定有人承认过在巴特勒的工作方式
Some of them must have admitted the way it works at Butler,

918
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,130
那就在你的记录里
and it's in your notes.

919
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,820
我看看我理解的对不对
Let me see if I have my facts straight.

920
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,260
你把我伤个透  还给自己找了理由
You eviscerate me, justify it,

921
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,090
之后又像一切都没发生过一样跑回来
and then waltz back here as if nothing happened.

922
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,260
我没当没事发生  但现在不是时候谈那个
I know something happened, but now is not the time.

923
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,580
不是时候是因为你又需要求我了
You mean now is not the time as long as you need a favor.

924
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,500
该死的  你这不是帮我
Oh, god damn it, you're not doing me a favor.

925
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,560
是帮你的病人  那个你说
You're helping your patient, the one you said

926
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,820
咨询三个律师  就为了不背叛他的那位
you went to see three different lawyers to keep from betraying.

927
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,370
可如果你没有背叛我
And if you hadn't betrayed me,

928
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,310
你现在就不会是这样的境地了
you wouldn't be in this position right now.

929
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,710
你想让我说什么  对不起吗
What do you want me to say-- I'm sorry?

930
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,160
事实上  是的
As a matter of fact, I do.

931
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,990
你以为我想那样贬低你吗
You think I wanted to depose you like that?

932
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,020
我也很痛苦
It made me sick.

933
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,950
我憎恨那过程的每一秒钟
I hated every goddamn second of it,

934
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,230
因为我知道你一直都在努力帮助我
because I know all you've been trying to do is help me,

935
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,260
而我之前没道歉的唯一原因
and the only reason I didn't apologize before

936
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,200
是因为如果知道这就能保证山姆不入狱
is because if I knew it kept Sam out of prison,

937
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,630
我还会再来一次
I'd do it all again.

938
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,150
现在  你愿意帮我了吗
Now, are you gonna help me?

939
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,190
哈维  就算我想帮你
Harvey, even if I wanted to help you,

940
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,060
我的档案里也没那些事
it -- it doesn't say those things in my files.

941
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,270
我还是需要它们
I need them anyway.

942
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,820
我刚说了他们没有你要的东西
I just told you they don't have what you need.

943
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,580
这我知道  你也知道
I know that, and you know that,

944
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,950
但他们不知道
but they don't know that.

945
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,610
你想吓唬他们
You're gonna try and bluff them?

946
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,790
那没用的
It won't work.

947
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,600
你见过我在取证会上对你做的
You saw what I did in there to you,

948
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,730
而且我还不想伤害你呢
and that was something I didn't want to do.

949
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,660
相信我  他们会输的落花流水
Trust me, they won't know what hit 'em.

950
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,420
我们被麦肯诺炒了
We get fired by Mckernon Motors,

951
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,280
你们却没有跟我说  也没跟哈维说
and you didn't tell me and you didn't tell Harvey?

952
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,870
-稍等  杰西卡  -真是够了
- Wait, Jessica-- - God damn it.

953
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,830
我们没说是因为我们是被炒过
We didn't tell anyone because we were fired

954
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,650
不到一天  然后我们又弥补回来了
for less than a day, and then we fixed it.

955
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,020
是吗  弥补回来了
Oh, you fixed it?

956
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,100
是的  那只是个是误会
Yes, it was all a misunderstanding.

957
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,200
多米尼克已经回来了
Now Dominic's back on board.

958
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,750
我才不管多米尼克是不是又回来了
I don't give a shit that Dominic is back on board

959
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,380
弗莱彻引擎公司也不在乎
and neither does Fletcher Engines.

960
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,490
-弗莱彻引擎公司  -没错
- Fletcher Engines? - That's right.

961
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,790
你们被麦肯诺炒掉不到一天
In the less than a day that you were fired by Mckernon,

962
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,940
弗莱彻就成了杰克・索罗夫的客户
Jack Soloff signed Fletcher as a client,

963
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,340
而我如今得放弃麦肯诺了
and now I have to let Mckernon go.

964
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,320
狗娘养的
That son of a bitch.

965
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,810
杰西卡  这一切都是他策划好的
Jessica, he set this whole thing up.

966
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,400
我相信肯定不是因为你跟他作对来着
Oh, and I'm sure you did nothing to antagonize him.

967
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,780
我什么都没干  我发誓  我没有小气
I did do nothing. I swear, I wasn't petty.

968
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,540
我信任他  他却利用这信任
I trusted him, and then he used that trust

969
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,320
在我们背后捅刀子
to stab us in the back.

970
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,520
杰西卡  你真不知道
Jessica, you have no idea.

971
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,590
路易这辈子从没这么睿智过
Louis has never been more right in his life.

972
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,620
你不能放弃麦肯诺  哈维会疯的
You can't dump Mckernon. It'll kill Harvey.

973
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,260
但现在我们也不能代表他们了
Well, we can't goddamn represent them now,

974
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,030
你们也知道
and you know it.

975
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,150
你让杰克放弃弗莱彻  我们就可以
We can if you tell Jack he has to drop Fletcher.

976
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,810
知道你们把我推到什么样的处境上了吗
Do you realize the position you're putting me in?

977
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,630
弗莱彻的价值是麦肯诺的三倍
Fletcher is worth three times what Mckernon is.

978
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,570
很抱歉你的尴尬处境
I'm sorry you're in this position right now,

979
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,050
但这次  害你陷入这种处境的不是我
but for once, I'm not the one who put you in it.

980
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,720
是杰克・索罗夫
Jack Soloff is.

981
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,110
晚餐准备好了
Dinner is served.

982
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,390
我猜你还是给那个臭小子送上结婚大礼了
I guess that means you got opie his bridal gift after all.

983
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,520
没错
I did.

984
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,420
而且我不该在档案室里对你那么不友好
And I shouldn't have been so standoffish with you in the file room.

985
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,310
是我不该让我们的初次会面那么不愉快
Well, maybe I shouldn't have had that be our first interaction.

986
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,760
不  不怪你  怪我
No, that's not on you. That's on me.

987
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,930
我从没欢迎你进入公司  我应该欢迎的
I never welcomed you to the firm, and I should have.

988
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,990
我还是个年轻母亲时
You know, when I was a young mother,

989
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,510
我女儿开学第一周  我每天都送她上学
first week of school, every day I dropped my little girl off.

990
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,070
我一离开她就哭
When I left, she cried.

991
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,160
到周五了我走时  她没有哭
Friday came, I left, she didn't cry.

992
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,140
我却哭了
So I did.

993
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,300
你在说什么
What are you saying?

994
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,310
你没有欢迎我进公司
You didn't welcome me to the firm

995
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,420
是因为你没准备好看你的女儿向前走
because you weren't ready to see your little girl move on.

996
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,310
你是说我把哈维当作我的小女儿啦
Are you saying Harvey is my little girl?

997
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,290
我是说你没准备好向前走
I'm saying you weren't ready to move on.

998
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,250
你很厉害  格蕾琴
You're all right, Gretchen.

999
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,410
希望你喜欢法国菜
Hope you like French.

1000
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,330
好啊
Hi.

1001
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,950
你没必要专门安排预约
You know, you didn't have to schedule an appointment

1002
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,490
来告诉我结果
just to tell me how it turned out.

1003
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,150
我是为了来给你这个的
I scheduled an appointment to give you these.

1004
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,730
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

1005
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,980
是山姆・塔尔给的
They're from Sam Tull.

1006
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,820
那你给我带了什么东西吗
Did you get me anything?

1007
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,610
我有
I did.

1008
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,630
我准备好谈我母亲了
I'm ready to talk about my mother.

1009
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,990
好漂亮
This is beautiful.

1010
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,760
-为什么  -我想庆祝一个特殊的时刻
- Why did-- - I wanted to celebrate a special occasion.

1011
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,430
什么特殊时刻
What's the special occasion?

1012
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:39,110
我订到了你生日那天的广场饭店
I got us the Plaza Hotel on your birthday.

1013
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,540
举办我们的婚礼吗
For our wedding?

1014
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,430
对啊
Yeah.

1015
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,840
这是从你向我求婚以后
Oh, that is the sweetest thing you've done

1016
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,890
做过最贴心的事了
since you asked me to marry you.

1017
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,170
不  这是我做下件最贴心的事前
No, it's the sweetest thing I've done

1018
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,130
最贴心的事
until the next thing I do.

1019
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,490
迈克
Oh, Mike.

1020
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,700
你怎么做到的
I mean, how did you do it?

1021
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,840
一定非常难吧
That must have been impossible.

1022
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,510
不  小菜一碟
No, it was a piece of cake.

1023
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,260
你去找唐娜了吧
You went to donna, didn't you?

1024
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,890
所以才是小菜一碟啊
That's why it was a piece of cake.

1025
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,220
杰西卡  这么晚了你来干什么
Jessica, what are you doing here so late?

1026
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,780
我还没恭喜你签下了
I didn't get a chance to congratulate you

1027
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,490
弗莱彻引擎公司
on signing Fletcher Engines.

1028
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,220
好事传千里啊
Hey, good news travels fast.

1029
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,460
是啊  但你得放弃得更快
Yes, it does, and you're going to drop them even faster.

1030
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,180
我猜这跟我们和
I take it this has something to do

1031
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,290
麦肯诺马达公司的长期合作关系有关
with our long-standing relationship with Mckernon Motors.

1032
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,860
你非常清楚这到底跟什么有关
You know damn well what this has to do with.

1033
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,540
我知道我的客户可是国内第四大
I know that my client is the fourth-largest engine manufacturer

1034
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,250
引擎生产商
in the country.

1035
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,080
如果你光明正大地争取到他们
And if you had landed them like a man,

1036
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,330
我会第一个拿着香槟来庆贺
I'd be the first one in here with a bottle of champagne.

1037
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,100
但你却是靠坑害同事才争取到的
But you did it by putting a shiv in your fellow attorneys.

1038
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,150
所以...结果就是这样
So this-- it's how it's gonna be.

1039
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,070
你说的同事  指的是哈维吧
And by "fellow attorneys," don't you really mean "Harvey"?

1040
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,260
小心点  杰克
Watch yourself, Jack,

1041
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,510
明早前放弃弗莱彻引擎公司
and drop Fletcher Engines by morning.

1042
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,890
如果你不放  我也会
If you don't, I will.

1043
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,230
明早就放
By morning it is.

1044
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,280
到明天下午  整个公司都会知道
And by afternoon, the entire firm's gonna know

1045
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,730
你放弃弗莱彻  选了个中等价值的客户
that you chose a mid-size client over Fletcher

1046
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,250
就因为哈维・斯派克特喜欢他们
because Harvey Specter has an attachment to them...

1047
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,960
而你喜欢哈维
and you have an attachment to him.

1048
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,150
我欣赏敢挑战我的人  杰克
I admire people who challenge me, Jack.

1049
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,690
但挑战是有极限的  而你正在极限边缘
But there's a limit to that, and you are on the very edge.

1050
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,610
我说清楚点吧
So let me be clear.

1051
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,590
这是你最后一次跟我合作的机会
This is your last chance to work with me.

1052
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,300
抓住机会  你还有前途
Take it, and you have a future.

1053
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,290
抓不住  就去丹尼尔・哈德曼那求职吧
Don't, and you can go ask Daniel Hardman for a job,

1054
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,110
你我都清楚  抢弗莱彻引擎公司的主意
because we both know that's how you got the idea

1055
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,270
跟他们关系大得很
for Fletcher Engines in the first place.
