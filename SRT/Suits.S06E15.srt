{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on Suits

22
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,030
这不是《西部世界》
This isn't "Westworld."

23
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,070
-我不能使她人性化  -我只是希望你
- I can't make her human. - I'm just asking you

24
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,360
给她点同情心
to give her a little compassion. 

25
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,460
我不知道该怎么做
Well, I don't know how to do that. 

26
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,960
我刚和卡莉・唐纳休通过电话
Just got off the phone with Carly Donahue.

27
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,040
她把我们解雇了  唐娜
She fired us, Donna.

28
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,760
这不是你的错
This isn't your fault.

29
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,830
-你又想不到  -没事  我得回家去了
- You couldn't have known. - It's okay, I just need to go.

30
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,500
你以工作导致威胁生命的健康问题为由提出过控告
You filed a complaint alleging life-threatening health problems,

31
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,910
而我希望帮助你获得你应得的赔偿
and I wanna help you get the compensation that you deserve.

32
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,230
但即便我想起诉那帮混蛋  我也不能
Even if I wanted to sue those bastards, I can't.

33
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,290
我们能解除那些保密协议
We can shatter those NDAs.

34
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,310
需要我做什么
What do I have to do?

35
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,580
你是否想利用此案
I wanna know if you're using this case

36
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,770
重回皮尔逊-斯佩克特律所
to get back to Pearson Specter.

37
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,550
因为你告诉我你还在皮尔逊-斯佩克特律所时
You said Pearson Specter would never take on

38
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,140
他们绝不会接这种案子
a case like this when you were there before.

39
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,930
我们接这个案子  让我能进律师协会
We brought the suit so that I could get into the Bar.

40
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,820
-一个亿  -并公开承认犯错
- 100 million. - With an admission of guilt.

41
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,130
好啊  合同给我签
Sure, where do I sign?

42
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,310
我可以直接付给你的客户
I'm willing to cut your clients a check

43
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,280
让他们的生活焕然一新
that'll change their lives

44
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,590
而你却笨得看不到这点
and you're too stupid to see it.

45
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,890
你到底要不要为你曾经做过的负责
Are you ready to take responsibility or not?

46
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,150
你认为你偷了赛德尔公司的技术
You think I won't go after you

47
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,550
我不呢个追究你盗窃吗
for stealing from Seidel's company?

48
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,140
我才不在乎他的婚姻
I don't give a shit about his marriage.

49
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,220
他不肯出面
The reason he hasn't come forward has nothing to do

50
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,160
根本不是因为他的婚姻
with his marriage. 

51
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,550
你不是因为结婚了才想低调处理此事
You didn't have to keep this quiet because you're married.

52
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,360
你是因为牵涉其中才这么做
You kept it quiet because you're in on it.

53
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,500
我的员工会因为我而失业
My employees are gonna lose their jobs because of me.

54
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,640
我们得把官司打下去
We need to keep this suit going.

55
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,570
你不仅要给迈克安排面试
You're not just getting Mike an interview,

56
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,050
还要说服每个投反对票的人
you're gonna block anyone who tries to vote no.

57
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,290
我们律师协会见
See you at the Bar.

58
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,400
斯塔摩斯先生  你来做什么
Mr. Stamos. What are you doing here?

59
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,320
我想把病例的授权拿给你
I wanted to get you the authorization to our medical records.

60
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,770
谢谢
Thanks.

61
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,170
但是  你大老远来
But, uh, you didn't come all the way down here

62
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,670
不是为了送份文件吧
just to hand me some paperwork.

63
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,880
是啊  我是来问问
You're right. I came to find out

64
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,460
我们的案子怎么样了
what's going on with our case.

65
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,560
应该很快就会有消息了
We should hear something soon.

66
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,830
-你怎么能知道  -因为哈维这会儿
- How can you know that? - 'Cause Harvey is negotiating

67
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,290
就在跟詹姆斯・帕默谈判
with James Palmer as we speak.

68
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,360
什么意思
What do you mean?

69
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,140
为什么是哈维・斯佩克特去谈判
Why is Harvey Specter negotiating this?

70
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,570
我们拉上他时我就说过
I told you when we took him on,

71
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,120
他是本市最好的谈判人
he's the best negotiator in the city.

72
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,920
我不在乎他是谁
I don't care who he is.

73
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,270
是你来找我的  我信任的是你
You're the one that came to me. You're the one I trusted.

74
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,850
我知道  但我们有红白脸的策略
I know that, but we've got a good cop/bad cop strategy

75
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,500
-好抬高报价  -报价
- to get the offer up. - An offer?

76
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,300
你没提什么报价
You didn't tell me there's an offer.

77
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,730
-因为事情...  -多少
- That's because things are - How much?

78
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,870
现在的数字是一亿
The number on the table is a hundred.

79
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,960
但我们想拿到更多
But we're hoping to get a lot more.

80
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,420
天呐  一亿美元吗  接受啊
Jesus Christ, 100 million? Take it.

81
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,070
我知道这看上去是不少
I know it seems like a lot of money--

82
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,600
-这的确不少  -但要150个
- It is a lot of money. - Not when you have to

83
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,700
患了癌症的人均分就不那么多了
split it between 150 men who have cancer.

84
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,170
随你怎么算  罗斯先生
Do all the math you want, Mr. Ross,

85
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,210
但一亿美元比零多多了
but 100 million is a hell of lot better than zero,

86
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,880
而我们以前得到的就是零
which is what we've been walking around with.

87
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,720
斯塔摩斯先生  你得信任我
Mr. Stamos, you have to trust me.

88
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,050
我们心里有数  我不会让你失望的
We know what we're doing and I am not gonna let you down.

89
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,390
好吧
Fine.

90
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,680
你采取你的红白脸策略吧
You do your good cop/bad cop thing.

91
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,090
但如果那数字两天内还不升高
But if that number doesn't go up in the next two days,

92
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,960
我就会叫大家接受已有的报价
I'm telling my guys to take the offer that's on the table.

93
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,430
本杰明  真・唐娜已经可以了
Benjamin, the Donna is ready.

94
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,700
什么意思
What do you mean she's ready? 

95
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,730
我是说  五分钟前  她向我表达了共情
I mean, five minutes ago she expressed empathy to me.

96
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,320
但之前不好使的
But it wasn't working before.

97
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,560
我还以为不可能成功了
I was convinced it never would.

98
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,100
我不知道你做了什么  但你说它可以
I don't know what you did, but you said it could

99
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,600
自我学习  它做到了
learn from itself, and that's exactly what happened.

100
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,360
天呐  或许我真是个天才
Oh, my God. Maybe I really am a genius.

101
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,590
是啊
Yeah, maybe you are.

102
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,490
那幸好我没把这个丢掉
Well, then it's a good thing I didn't throw this away.

103
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,840
-这是什么  -我列了张单子
- What's this? - I've compiled a list

104
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,570
写了所有这五年来对此类产品
of everybody who's invested in products like this

105
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,790
投过资的人
in the last five years.

106
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
很好  但我们不需要这个
That's great, but we're not gonna need this.

107
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,660
为什么
Why not?

108
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,290
因为真・唐娜的特别之处是我
Because the thing that makes the Donna special is me.

109
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,930
所以我们得找认识我的投资者
Which means we need to look into investors who know me.

110
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,060
是啊  没错  没人比哈维更了解你了
Yes, correct, and nobody knows you better than Harvey.

111
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,570
你觉得他会代我们找人吗
Do you think he'll make calls on our behalf?

112
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,400
他会的  但我不会去求他
He would, but I'm not gonna ask him to do that

113
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,720
因为我希望他的客户看到
because I want his clients to see this

114
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,280
这是我的主意  不是他的
as coming from me and not him.

115
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,330
那我们接下来怎么办
Then what's the next step?

116
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,290
你接下来要做好展示它的准备
The next step for you is get ready to present that thing,

117
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,690
因为我会为我们安排会面的
because I'm going to get us some meetings.

118
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,830
太棒了
Boom shakalaka.

119
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,750
你知道现在几点了吗
Do you have any idea what time it is?

120
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,630
知道  但等不了了
I do, but it couldn't wait.

121
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,510
瑞秋呢
Where's Rachel?

122
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,360
她去父母家了  怎么了
She's at her parents' house. Why?

123
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,480
因为我有消息
Because I have some news

124
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,400
-她会想听听的  -什么事
- and she's gonna wanna hear it. - What is it?

125
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,840
我们成了  你进了
We got it. You're in.

126
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,710
-你能当律师了  -什么  怎么说
- You're going to be a lawyer. - What? How?

127
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,000
赛德尔也有份  他收了钱
Seidel was in on it. He got paid.

128
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,510
我有证据  所以我们不用再去
And I got proof. Which means we don't have to

129
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,230
拉低极速的股价了
worry about tanking Velocity's stock anymore.

130
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,370
天呐  难以置信
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

131
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,660
-我要当律师了  -是啊
- I'm going to be a lawyer. - I know.

132
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,010
但有个麻烦
There's just one thing.

133
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,000
帕默发现我们在跟赛德尔合作了
Palmer figured out that we're doing this with Seidel.

134
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,340
除非我们撤诉
And unless we drop the lawsuit,

135
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,460
否则他要告我们合谋
he's gonna come after us for collusion.

136
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,680
等等  什么
Wait, what?

137
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,060
不  这不行
No, this is bullshit.

138
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,480
我不会放弃那些矿工的
I'm not giving up on those miners.

139
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,200
-你必须放弃  -并非如此
- You have to. - No, I don't.

140
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,090
-迈克  -听着  我们唯一
- Mike. - Look, the only thing

141
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,570
做错的事是做交易帮我当上律师
we did wrong was make a deal to get me into the Bar.

142
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,270
如果我通过听证会  帕默就动不了我们
If I pull out of that hearing, Palmer can't touch us.

143
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,730
你是...想想看你在说什么
Are you--think about what you're saying.

144
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,870
我不需要想
I don't need to think about it.

145
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,590
我不会丢下他们不管的
I'm not going to throw those guys under the bus.

146
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,170
-迈克  我们已经走到这一步  -我不管
- Mike, we've come too far - I don't care.

147
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,030
告诉赛德尔交易取消
Tell Seidel the deal's off.

148
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,860
如果还有别的办法呢
What if there was another way?

149
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,610
哈维  如果你是想另外找人
Harvey, if you're talking about somebody else

150
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,740
-来接这个案子  -不是
- handling this case - No, I'm not.

151
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,980
听着  赛德尔不可能是自己想到
Listen to me, there's no way Seidel came up with the idea

152
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,010
要卖情报给极速
to sell that shit to Velocity himself.

153
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,700
跟他出轨的女人肯定是为他们工作的
The woman he had an affair with has to work for them,

154
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,960
所以  我们可以拿她做筹码搞帕默
which means we can leverage her to sink Palmer.

155
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,180
-你开玩笑吗  -没有
- Are you kidding me? - No, I'm--

156
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,330
哈维  听听你自己  这可是不折不扣的
Harvey, listen to yourself. You're talking about out and out

157
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,470
敲诈和勒索
extortion and blackmail.

158
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,970
我不会为了成为律师
I'm not going to do any of that shit

159
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,680
做那样的事
just to get into the God damn Bar.

160
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,220
是你告诉我  你眼看那孩子输了官司
You were the one that told me that after watching that kid lose,

161
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,560
所以不想那种事再发生
you never wanted it to happen again.

162
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,160
现在那孩子告诉我们  这么做是错的
And now that same kid is telling us that what we're doing is wrong.

163
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,670
-他是对的  -迈克
- And he's right. - Mike.

164
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,130
不  哈维  够了
No, Harvey, it's enough.

165
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,170
你答应过瑞秋如果情况太危险
You promised Rachel that you'd pull the plug

166
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,220
就中止行动
if things got too risky.

167
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,280
现在
Well...

168
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,140
已经太危险了
it just got too God damn risky.

169
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,870
{\an8}诉讼双雄 第六季 第十五集

170
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,950
怎么回事
What's going on?

171
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,600
天还未亮你就起床了
You got out of bed before it was light out.

172
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,350
还没回床上来
And you never came back.

173
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,030
我想跟你谈谈
I want to talk to you for a minute.

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,110
谈什么
About what?

175
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,250
我知道你去找哈维  逼他保证
I know you went to Harvey and you made him promise

176
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,890
如果我做律师的事太危险
to pull the plug on my getting into the Bar

177
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,280
就中止行动
if things got too risky.

178
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,920
他不该告诉你的
He wasn't supposed to tell you that.

179
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,320
你真觉得他不会说吗
Did you really think he wouldn't?

180
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,900
迈克  我让他对我那样承诺只是因为我在乎你
Mike, I only made him promise because I care about you.

181
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,340
没事  我知道原因
It's okay. I know why you did it.

182
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,300
也理解
And I understand it.

183
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,050
而且昨晚我自己已经叫停了这件事
And last night, I ended up pulling the plug myself.

184
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,850
-所以都结束了吗  -结束了
- So it's over? - It's over.

185
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,520
不当律师了
Not gonna be a lawyer.

186
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,570
迈克
Mike.

187
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,420
事实上  在哈维在我面前念叨这件事之前
The thing is, I was fine with it until Harvey started

188
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,210
我其实不太在意
dangling it in front of my face.

189
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,920
我觉得问题就出在我真的开始相信
I think the problem was, I actually started

190
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,320
这件事能成功了
believing it could happen.

191
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,750
你今天需要我陪你吗
Do you want me to stay with you today?

192
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,170
不用
No.

193
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,550
我没事
I'll be okay.

194
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,370
另外你今天有很多事要做
Besides, you've got a lot of work to do

195
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,650
我也有个大案子要赢
and I've got a big case to win.

196
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,870
哈维  你在这
Harvey, there you are.

197
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,630
路易要马上见你
Louis needs to see you right away.

198
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,660
唐娜  不论是什么事我现在都没时间
Donna, whatever it is, I don't have time right now.

199
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,970
那就挤时间出来
Well, you need to make time.

200
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,120
因为他昨晚就来找你了并且很沮丧
Because he came looking for you last night and he's upset.

201
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,490
对不起  唐娜  但我真的没时间听
Well, I'm sorry, Donna. But I'm too busy to hear about

202
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,150
他说和女朋友间的另一次危机
another crisis with his girlfriend

203
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,510
或者他的扑克俱乐部又怎么了
or drama in his canasta club

204
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,740
还是他的牙齿保护器不合适
or how his mouth guard doesn't fit.

205
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,390
时尚定制把我们解雇了
Couture Apparel fired us.

206
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,520
-什么  -卡莉很生气
- What? - Carly got upset that

207
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,010
路易没和你一起而带了瑞秋和卡特里娜参会
Louis brought Rachel and Katrina to the meeting instead of you.

208
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,970
他为她们辩解的时候  她就解雇了他
And when he stood up to her about it, she fired him.

209
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,020
混蛋
Shit.

210
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,050
哈维  他很内疚
Harvey, he feels terrible about it.

211
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,230
觉得自己让你失望了
He thinks he let you down.

212
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,980
他没有  是我让他失望了
Well, he didn't. I let him down.

213
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,500
而且到头来只是白忙一场
And it turns out it was all for nothing.

214
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,240
什么意思  什么叫白忙
What do you mean, nothing? What happened?

215
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,460
帕默猜到了赛德尔干的事
Palmer figured out what's going on with Seidel

216
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,220
迈克宁可拒绝他的条件也要继续这个案子
and Mike would rather pull his deal than drop the case.

217
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,660
那他就永远也当不了律师了
But then he'll never get into the Bar.

218
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,090
所以我才说我没时间
Why do you think I said I don't have time

219
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,370
处理任何别的事情
for anything else right now?

220
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,280
所以你是在说那个混蛋
So you're telling me that asshole's

221
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,740
完全控制了局面  迈克永远也当不了律师了
holding all the cards, and Mike's never gonna be a lawyer?

222
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,010
不  没有人能完全掌控局面
No, no one's ever holding all the cards.

223
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,490
我也不在乎迈克说什么
And I don't give a shit what Mike said,

224
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,430
我在知道能赢得情况下绝对不会弃牌
I'm not going folding when I know we can win.

225
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,470
路易  在你说话之前我想说
Louis, before you say anything,

226
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,850
唐娜已经告诉我了
Donna told me what happened.

227
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,640
-哈维  我很抱歉  -我知道
- Harvey, I am so sorry-- - I know you are.

228
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,130
但我来不是骂你的
But I didn't come here to scold you.

229
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,550
我来是因为我需要你的帮助
I came here because I need your help

230
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,960
否则迈克的协议就要告吹了
or Mike's deal is gonna fall apart.

231
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,010
为什么  怎么可能  
What? How's that possible? 

232
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,090
这么说吧  有人有控制我们的筹码
Let's just say someone's got leverage on us

233
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,120
我们也需要一点来对付他们
and I need to get leverage on them.

234
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,170
要什么筹码
What kind of leverage? 

235
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,720
有个在极速公司工作的女人
There's a woman who works at Velocity.

236
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,980
她和赛德尔有私情
She had an affair with Seidel.

237
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,640
我需要知道她是谁
I need to know who she is.

238
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,310
极速公司有几千个员工
Thousands of people work at Velocity.

239
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,120
我知道  但能做到她做的事
Yeah, I know that. But to do what she did,

240
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,880
她肯定是个高层管理人员
she'd have to be a top corporate officer.

241
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,780
这确实能缩窄范围  但也需要
Well, that narrows it down. But it's still gonna require

242
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,850
大量的调查和几百个电话
huge amounts of research and hundreds of phone calls.

243
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,620
不  路易  只需要一个电话
No, Louis, it'll only require one phone call.

244
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,290
因为我需要的是接触到他们的数据库
Because what I need is access to their database.

245
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,370
不  哈维  总有别人可以做到的
No, Harvey, there's got to be someone else.

246
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,920
凡妮莎不做类似的事你也知道
Vanessa doesn't do this kind of thing and you know it.

247
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,680
我发过誓再也不和那个混蛋
I swore that I would never do business

248
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,760
有任何往来
with that son of a bitch again.

249
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,860
我知道  路易  但如果我们不做
I know that, Louis. But if we don't do this...

250
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,500
好吧  出去吧
All right, get out.

251
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,140
从外面把门关上
Close the door behind you.

252
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,980
-奥利佛  -怎么了
- Oliver. - What's up?

253
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,670
我们有事情做了
What's up is we got work to do.

254
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,360
迈克  我不想当混蛋
Mike, I don't mean to be an asshole,

255
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,220
但如果你不告诉纳森到底发生了什么的话
but I'm not doing anything until you tell Nathan

256
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,650
-我什么也不做了  -没什么好说的了
- exactly what's going on. - There's nothing to tell.

257
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,900
-你开玩笑吗  你说你接这个案子
- Are you kidding me? You said you were

258
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,530
是为了重新当律师
doing this case as a way to get into the Bar.

259
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,340
我刚刚撤回了我的申请
And I just withdrew my application.

260
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,730
没什么协议了  所以之前应当告诉纳森的事
There's no deal anymore. So whatever it was I was

261
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,110
也没必要再说了
gonna tell Nathan, I don't have to tell him anymore.

262
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,390
就这样  你放弃机会了
Just like that. You're giving up your chance?

263
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,340
听着  你昨晚说的那些话我听进去了
Look, I heard what you said to me last night

264
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,740
说要树立榜样
about setting an example.

265
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,150
所以与其告诉纳森
So instead of telling Nathan

266
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,290
我要做些见不得人的勾当
that I was up to something shady,

267
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,680
我是说我彻底不做了
I'm telling you that I'm not.

268
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,220
你需要我做什么
What do you need me to do?

269
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,820
我需要你去皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特
I need you to get down to PSL and grab half a dozen

270
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,990
抓几个律师来
of those associates and bring them back here.

271
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,660
你有什么打算
What are you gonna do?

272
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,360
我要竭尽所能确保这件事
I'm gonna do whatever I can to make sure

273
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,710
还没结束
this thing isn't over yet.

274
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,470
是的  让那些混蛋去死
Yeah, screw those assholes, 

275
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,810
他们只是一些没种的废物
they're nothing but a bunch of dickless losers.

276
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,580
好的  我会为你把他们击垮
Yeah, I'll break them into little pieces for you,

277
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,820
我向你保证
you have my word on it.

278
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,260
好了  我要挂了  我也爱你  妈咪
All right, I got to go. I love you too, Mommy.

279
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,280
-斯图  -唐娜
- Stu. - Donna.

280
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,450
不得不说  我没想到你是个
Gotta say, I didn't figure you for a guy

281
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,380
会管母亲叫妈咪的人
who called his mother "Mommy." 

282
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,640
我只能说  如果一个男人没有自信那么做
What can I say, if a man doesn't have the confidence to do that,

283
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,630
那他就不算个男人
then he's not really a man.

284
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,770
但我猜你大老远跑到这里来
But I'm guessing you didn't come all the way down here

285
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,270
绝不只是为了评价我和
just to evaluate my relationship

286
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,380
世界上最伟大的女人的关系的
with the greatest woman on Earth.

287
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,460
不  不是
No, I didn't.

288
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,720
我来是为了给你看这个
I came here to show you this.

289
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,160
-那是什么  -是个了不起的东西
- What's that? - It's a game-changer.

290
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,390
我在给你优先见证的机会
And I'm letting you in on the ground floor.

291
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,010
你这么说倒是很大胆
That's a bold statement.

292
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,650
打开吧
Turn it on.

293
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,070
你可以尽情享用
Keep it for as long as you want.

294
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,560
当你被震惊以后
And then when you're blown away,

295
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,890
就带着报价来找我吧
come back to me with an offer.

296
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,290
因为我和我的合伙人一定会大获成功
Because my partner and I, we're gonna go wide with this

297
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,940
我们需要一个投资人
and we're going to need an investor.

298
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,910
那你为什么来找我
Why are you coming to me with this?

299
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,200
因为我想给你个机会
Because I wanted to give someone the chance

300
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,490
将它推向市场
to take it off the market.

301
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,280
这个人一定要有自信
And it needed to be someone with the confidence

302
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,140
管母亲叫作妈咪
to call his mother "Mommy."

303
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,920
让我们来这见你真是你的风格
It's typical you would have us meet you here.

304
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,280
没用的人才来赌博
Gambling's for suckers, you know?

305
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,370
只有当结果是未知的时候才叫赌博
It's only gambling when the results are unknown.

306
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,850
局势对自己有利时  说好话没什么不对
There's nothing wrong with tilting the game in your favor.

307
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,090
我喜欢这家伙  路易
I like this guy, Louis.

308
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,420
为什么我之前没见过他
Why haven't I met him before?

309
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,070
你知道原因的  我们直入正题吧
You know why. So why don't we just get to it?

310
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,100
我们需要你黑进极速数据的员工记录
We need you to hack into Velocity Data's personnel records.

311
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,160
你能做到吗
Now, can you do it or not?

312
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,420
你要不要说得再大声点
You want to say that a little bit louder

313
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,450
让那边联调局的人听见
so the Fed over there can hear it?

314
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,690
放轻松  杰瑞  路易想表达的是
Relax, Jerry. What Louis is trying to say

315
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,120
有个在那里工作的女人
is there's a woman who works there

316
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,700
她手上有我们需要拿来做交易的信息
who has information we need to make a deal.

317
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,940
做交易
Make a deal?

318
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,460
我也说不好
Ah, I don't know.

319
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,900
我开始觉得这听上去像是勒索
That's starting to sound like blackmail,

320
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,560
这不在我的业务范围内啊
which is a little bit out of my league.

321
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,140
放屁  你就是干这个的
Bullshit. It's in your league.

322
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,790
我开始觉得你听上去像是在讨价还价了
And it's starting to sound like you're renegotiating,

323
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,400
你一向如此
like you always do.

324
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,590
你猜怎么着  路易
You know what, Louis?

325
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,140
这几年来我受够你的屁话了
I just about had enough of your bullshit over the years.

326
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,520
我讨价还价是因为你给我的报价低了
I renegotiate 'cause you low-ball me.

327
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,460
不  我告诉过...
No, I told--

328
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,580
杰瑞  这次你不是和路易做生意
Jerry, you're not dealing with Louis on this one,

329
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,330
而是和我
you're dealing with me.

330
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,550
你不如告诉我你要什么
So why don't you tell me what you need

331
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,110
然后我们把这事搞定
and let's get this thing done?

332
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,170
假如我需要黑进什么地方
If I'm gonna access anything,

333
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,340
你刚刚告诉我的那点信息可不够
I need to know more than you just told me.

334
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,240
因为假如我没拿到你想要的东西
'Cause I don't get what you want,

335
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,670
那也没有第二次机会了
there's no going back a second time.

336
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,640
好吧  有位极速的女员工
All right, there's a woman who works at Velocity

337
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,180
她和我客户公司的内部法律顾问睡在了一起
who slept with the in-house counsel at my client's company

338
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,650
然后说服他泄露了一些机密信息
and convinced him to sell confidential information.

339
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,140
我猜猜  她向他许诺
Let me guess, she promised him the Moon,

340
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,180
然后就把他晾在那儿了
then hung him out to dry.

341
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,130
没错  你为什么要知道
Yeah, why?

342
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,550
你不需要黑进极速的记录
You don't need to access Velocity's records.

343
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,360
-她不是他们的员工  -你怎么知道
- She doesn't work there. - How do you know?

344
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,350
因为我知道她是谁
Because I know who she is.

345
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,900
-我的报价要翻三倍  -三倍
- And the price just tripled. - Tripled?

346
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,380
你个虚伪的混蛋
You hypocritical piece of shit.

347
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,160
你都不用黑进哪里
You don't even have to access anything.

348
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,700
你知道那句老话是怎么说的
Well, you know what they say.

349
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,180
给管子工付钱不是因为他们敲了管子
You don't pay the plumber for banging on the pipes.

350
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,900
而是因为他们知道该往哪里敲
You pay him for knowing where to bang.

351
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,220
说得好
Yahtzee.

352
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,700
而且我告诉你  我敲的这个地方
And I'm telling you, where I'm banging,

353
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,620
可是会有很多东西掉出来的
a whole lot of shit's gonna fall out.

354
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,270
所以你们要么给足我钱  要么滚蛋
So you're either gonna pay up or you're not.

355
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,680
我打扰到你了吗
Am I interrupting?

356
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,610
和你说实话  我刚刚...
To tell you the truth, I've just been

357
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,600
盯着屏幕盯了15分钟了
staring at this screen for the past 15 minutes.

358
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,130
我每天做的就是这事  我称之为工作
That's what I do all day. I call it working.

359
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,410
但我猜你盯着屏幕不是为了工作吧
But I'm going to guess that's not why you're staring.

360
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,280
我是在想迈克
I was thinking about Mike.

361
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,930
他告诉你他放弃交易了
He told you he gave up the deal?

362
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,270
他说了  而且...
He did, and, um...

363
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,440
他还说他不当律师也没什么
he said that he's okay not being a lawyer.

364
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,920
但他的表情出卖了他
But the look on his face didn't say that at all.

365
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,810
那你可能会对我接下来要说的感兴趣
Then you might be interested in what I have to say.

366
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,610
因为这事最终让迈克能当上律师
Because it involves getting Mike into the Bar after all.

367
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,540
哈维  你为什么和我谈而不是和迈克谈
Harvey, why are you telling me this instead of Mike?

368
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,910
因为你说如果事情变得太危险
Because you asked me to pull the plug

369
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,590
我要及时叫停
on this whole thing if it got too risky,

370
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,400
而我所说的事
and what I'm talking about

371
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,370
会让整件事变得非常危险
is gonna make it a hell of a lot riskier.

372
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,320
那迈克是怎么说的
And what did Mike say?

373
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,780
-他不想这么做  -为什么
- He doesn't want to do it. - Why not?

374
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,040
你知道原因的  因为这并非完全合法
You know why not. It's not 100% legal.

375
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,950
假如你不想的话你也可以拒绝
And you can say no if you want to.

376
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,550
但你在他脸上看见的表情
But that look you saw on his face,

377
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,110
可就消失不了了
that's not going away any time soon.

378
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,450
好吧
Okay.

379
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,020
我加入
I'm in.

380
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,600
但这次如果出事了  你要来负责任
But this time, if something goes wrong, you take the fall.

381
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,150
好的  我会负责的
Okay, I will.

382
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,730
现在  你是打算继续盯着那块屏幕
Now, you gonna go back to staring at that thing

383
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,260
还是来帮我让迈克当上律师
or you want to help me get Mike into the Bar

384
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,360
同时找点乐子
and have some fun at the same time?

385
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,260
你需要我做什么
What do you need me to do?

386
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,770
我需要你回家去
I need you to go home, 

387
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,780
换身好看很多的衣服
put on something a hell of a lot nicer,

388
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,950
然后一小时后和我在这个地址见
and meet me at this address in an hour.

389
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,480
宝贝 
Hey, sweetie.

390
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,080
我马上就好
I'll be done in a few minutes.

391
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,600
-你今天过得怎样  -还好
- How's your day? - Fine.

392
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,680
路易  我们说过的
Louis, we talked about this.

393
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,780
你可以向我倾诉
You can share your day with me.

394
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,600
-我就是来逗你开心的  -不是那回事
- I'm here to cheer you up. - It's not that.

395
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
只是有时候
It's just that sometimes, 

396
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,640
我不得不做一些不是那么好的事
I have to do some less than great things 

397
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,850
和一些不是那么好的人合作
with less than great people

398
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,170
而我宁愿把这些记忆从我脑子里洗掉
and I'd rather wash the memories from my brain.

399
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,840
什么叫"不是那么好的事"
What do you mean, less than great things?

400
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,580
没什么  不是什么大事儿
Nothing, it's not that big a deal.

401
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,090
你是在说伤害一个无辜的人吗
Are you talking about hurting an innocent person?

402
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,030
不  当然不是
No, of course not.

403
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,680
那能有多糟糕
Then how bad can it be?

404
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,570
完全没有那么糟糕  塔拉
Well, it's not that bad at all, Tara.

405
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,410
实际上  我所做的一切
As a matter of fact, I'm doing it all

406
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,080
都是为了帮助某个我很关心的人
to help someone I care deeply about.

407
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,320
而有时为了做好事
And sometimes to do good,

408
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,080
免不了会用一些不太干净的手段
you gotta get a little dirty.

409
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,740
也许你可以带我回家
Well, then maybe you can take me home

410
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,040
对我用一些不太干净的手段
and get a little dirty with me.

411
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,140
亲爱的  我想啊
Oh, sweetie, I want to

412
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,760
但我现在不太有心情
but I'm just not in the mood.

413
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,410
你确定不想向我倾诉一下吗
Are you sure this isn't something you wanna share with me?

414
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,760
-我确定  -好吧
- Yes, I'm sure. - Okay.

415
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,110
当我希望你知道
But I want you to know,

416
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,840
无论什么事你都可以和我说的
you can tell me anything.

417
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,260
塔拉  抱歉  但我不能和你一块回家了
Tara, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to meet you at home.

418
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,720
怎么了
Oh, what is it?

419
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,440
没什么  我只是得去见哈维一面  好吗
Nothing, I just have to go see Harvey, okay?

420
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,350
好的
Okay.

421
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,400
路易  我只有两分钟
Louis, I've got about two minutes.

422
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,140
我和瑞秋约了
I'm gonna meet Rachel. 

423
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,850
那就花两分钟看看这个
Well, take two minutes to look at this.

424
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,040
-这是什么  -艾伦・菲尔兹的来信
- What is it? - It's a letter from Allen Fields.

425
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,600
该死
Shit.

426
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,750
因为我们近期的人员变动
He's putting us in review

427
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,130
他要重新考虑是否继续用我们
based on our recent affiliations.

428
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,940
你知道那是什么意思吧
You know what that means.

429
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,030
我当然知道
Yeah, I sure as hell do.

430
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,760
那你应该知道我刚刚收到另外十封信
Well, then you should know that I just got ten more

431
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,630
是另外十个客户发来的
from ten other clients

432
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,950
他们都是这个意思
and they all say the same thing.

433
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,470
那个混蛋
That son of a bitch.

434
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,280
路易  我不会被威胁的
Louis, I'm not gonna be bullied.

435
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,570
不  我不在乎你要怎么做
No, I don't care what you're gonna be.

436
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,080
现在  我们丢掉了时尚定制公司
Now, we lost Couture Apparel

437
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,200
因为你忙着处理迈克的事
because you were too busy with Mike.

438
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,960
现在这情况完全一致
This is the same exact thing in different clothes.

439
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,650
-路易  -哈维
- Louis. - Harvey,

440
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,740
我刚刚得向我爱的女人撒谎
I just had to lie to the woman I love

441
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,090
因为我不想说出关于迈克的真相
because I didn't want to admit the whole truth about Mike.

442
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,000
现在  我愿意孤注一掷利用杰瑞
Now, I'm willing to go with the Hail Mary of using Jerry.

443
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,720
但我不愿意拿我们律所冒险
But what I am not willing to do is risk our survival.

444
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,520
-路易  -哈维  够了
- Louis. - Harvey, that is enough.

445
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,720
你知道需要做什么
You know what needs to be done.

446
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,910
解决它  否则我会做的
Do it, or I will.

447
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,830
帕默先生
Mr. Palmer.

448
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,930
我想你并没有看到备忘录
I take it you didn't get the memo.

449
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,300
这个案子已经结束了
This case is over.

450
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,910
那是因为还没有结束
Well, that's because it's not.

451
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,410
这是什么
What the hell is this?

452
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,450
那是我写给纽约律师协会的信的副本
That's a copy of my letter to the New York Bar,

453
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,410
我要把自己从备选名单上除名
removing myself from consideration.

454
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,270
没有面试  没有申请
No interview, no application,

455
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,710
没有交换条件
no quid pro quo,

456
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,210
也就是说这案子远远没有结束
which means this case is far from over.

457
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,890
你一定是在开玩笑
You have got to be kidding me.

458
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,240
我要放弃成为律师的机会
You're gonna give up your chance to be a lawyer

459
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,030
就为了在上周之前你甚至都不认识的矿工
for some miners you didn't even know existed before last week?

460
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,560
我现在认识了
Well, I know they exist now.

461
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,450
我还知道因为你  他们就要死了
And I know they're dying because of you.

462
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,920
所以  我们不仅要解决这件事
So, we're gonna settle this thing

463
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,830
而且现在就要解决
and we're going to settle it right now.

464
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,280
我来告诉你我会怎么做
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.

465
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,580
我会写给你一张1000万的支票
I'll write you a check for ten million right here.

466
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,250
1000万
Ten million?

467
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,120
你他妈在说什么
The hell are you talking about?

468
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,290
你告诉他们是一个亿了  是不是
Oh, you told them you'd get them a hundred, didn't you?

469
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,170
是的  我可以从你的脸上看出来
Yeah, you did. I can see it in your face.

470
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,020
我建议你告诉他们你不小心多加了个0
Well, I suggest you tell them you accidentally added a zero.

471
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,820
因为除此之外  你不会再拿到一分钱
Because you're not getting a nickel more.

472
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,330
让我提醒你一下  帕默先生
Let me remind you, Mr. Palmer.

473
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,680
我们对你提出了150件诉讼
We filed 150 suits against you.

474
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,180
我们每一场官司都会打
And we are gonna fight them all.

475
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,290
那之前对我是个震慑
And that shook me before.

476
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,220
但是谁现在会提供人力去打那些官司呢
But who's gonna supply the manpower to fight those suits now?

477
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,240
你知道的
You know who.

478
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,250
我看你是真的没有收到备忘啊
I guess you really didn't get the memo, did you?

479
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,080
因为皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特
Because Pearson Specter Litt 

480
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,860
刚刚撤出了这个案子
just withdrew from this case.

481
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,530
我会找到其他人的
I'll find someone else.

482
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,310
我很怀疑
I highly doubt it.

483
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,520
听着
Hey, listen to me.

484
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,390
你的公司伤害了这些人
Your company hurt these people.

485
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,370
你之前愿意以1亿的价格和解
You were willing to settle for a hundred million before.

486
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,560
这是你可以做正确的选择
This is your chance to do the right thing

487
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,150
同时还可以让你无愧于你的良知的机会
and clear your conscience at the same time.

488
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,550
听起来像是让你无愧于心的机会
Sounds to me like a chance to clear yours.

489
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,100
要么接受这个提议  要么放弃  罗斯先生
This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, Mr. Ross.

490
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,560
不管你接受与否
And whether you take it or not,

491
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,740
我都不想再在这见到你
I don't ever expect to see you here again.

492
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,710
-科伦维尔小姐  -怎么
- Ms. Cromwell?  - Yes.

493
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,510
我是米歇尔・罗斯
My name's Michelle Ross

494
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,200
我想雇你做事
and I was hoping to employ your services.

495
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,510
我的服务
My services? 

496
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,150
我是兰-考-赞律所的初级合伙人
Yes, I'm a junior partner at Rand Kaldor,

497
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,790
我正找机会想做出改变
and I'm looking to make a change.

498
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,230
抱歉  我不怎么和法律部门一起工作
I'm sorry, I don't really do much work with the legal sector.

499
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,110
事实上  我想把我的经验
Actually, I was hoping to use my experience

500
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,650
用到商业世界中
and parlay it into the business world.

501
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,450
我可以收下你的简历  但说实话
Well, I can take your résumé, but to be honest,

502
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,480
我并没有客户在找
I don't have a client who's looking for a candidate

503
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,730
-像你一样的候选人  -我知道没有
- like you at the moment. - I know you don't.

504
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,440
事实上  既然我们都实话实说了
In fact, since we're being honest,

505
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,590
你知道你要找什么样的候选人
I know exactly what kind of candidate you're looking for.

506
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,910
什么样的
What kind is that?

507
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,690
可以被操控
One that can be manipulated 

508
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,910
出卖他们雇主产品的人
into selling their employer's products.

509
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,010
你是谁
Who are you?

510
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,480
我是谁不重要
It doesn't matter who I am.

511
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,620
重要的是我知道你做了什么
What matters is I know what you do.

512
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,690
你一点都不了解我
You don't know anything about me.

513
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,990
我知道你明面上是个猎头
I know that you're officially a headhunter,

514
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,730
但是背地里  你在这样的地方
but unofficially, you meet your exclusively male clients

515
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,160
见你的高级男性客户
at places like this.

516
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,720
我还知道在这些会面的结尾
I also know that at the end of each of those meetings,

517
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,390
你会和他们说  "我从未这样做过
you say to them, "I never do this,

518
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,960
"但是你想一起吃晚餐吗"
"but would you like to have dinner?"

519
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,290
晚餐之后是甜点
And then dinner leads to dessert,

520
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,250
甜点之后就上床
dessert leads to sex, 

521
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,680
上床之后则让他们喜欢上你
and sex leads to them falling for you,

522
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,050
-然后  -好了  够了
- and that leads to-- - All right, I've heard enough.

523
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,180
你没有任何证据
And you don't have proof of anything.

524
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,960
事实上  我有
Actually, I do.

525
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,180
但你知道吗  我并不需要
But you know what? I don't need it.

526
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,310
因为只可能有两种情况
Because one of two things is going to happen.

527
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,420
一种是我雇人告诉你的每一位
Either I'm going to hire someone to tell every one

528
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,970
男性客户  当你和他们见面的时候
of your male clients when they meet them

529
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,480
你准备抢劫他们
that you're going to rob them,

530
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,440
然后你每单可以轻轻松松的
and then your cushy job making a million dollars per sucker

531
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,290
-挣100万美元  -又或者
- is going away- - Or?

532
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,490
又或者你告诉我
Or you're gonna tell me 

533
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,300
你每次帮詹姆斯・帕默这么做的情况
about every time you've done this for James Palmer,

534
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,250
你就再也不会见到我俩了
and you're never gonna hear from either one of us again.

535
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,390
我不能那样做
I can't do that.

536
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,760
我的工作要求要有个慎重的好名声
My job requires a reputation for discretion.

537
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
你按我们说的做
You're gonna do what we want,

538
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,610
否则你就会知道
or you're gonna find out 

539
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,440
你的好名声在监狱中能护你几分
how much your reputation protects you in prison.

540
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,970
我懂了  你不担心帕默知道这件事
Oh, I get it. You're not worried about Palmer knowing.

541
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,740
你担心的是消息会传播出去
You're worried about word spreading.

542
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,750
相信我  他不会告诉任何人的
Trust me, he'll never tell a soul

543
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,750
你的生意也不会受到影响
and your business will stay intact.

544
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,710
你怎么能这样肯定
How can you be sure?

545
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,380
和我确定你没有别的选择一样
The same way I'm sure that you don't have a choice.

546
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,140
问题是  你准备和他作对
The question is, are you gonna go against him

547
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,870
还是和我作对
or are you gonna go against me?

548
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,870
好  我加入
Okay, I'm in.

549
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,790
-就这样  -就这样
- Just like that? - Just like that.

550
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,000
这东西真他妈令人印象深刻
This thing is damn impressive.

551
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,280
但是在我们进行下一步之前
But before we move forward,

552
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,060
我得确定你和我能在一件事上达成共识
I need to make sure you're good with one thing.

553
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,080
什么
What's that?

554
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,430
我要百分之九十的股权
I want 90% ownership.

555
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,860
百分之九十  你疯了吗
90%? Are you out of your mind?

556
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,510
并没有
No, I'm not.

557
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,970
我不做风险投资
And I'm not in the venture capital business.

558
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,160
我做的是股票市场投资
I invest in the stock market.

559
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,520
这意味着我得用自己的钱
Which means I'd be using my own money on this.

560
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,890
这钱你肯定能挣回来
Money that you'd earn back in spades.

561
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,100
我希望是这样
I hope it turns out that way,

562
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,260
但这些事风险很大
but this thing has a lot of risk,

563
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,990
而且我要承担全部风险
and I'd be taking all of it.

564
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,020
那也许你不应该承担任何风险
Then maybe you should take none of it.

565
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,600
唐娜  这东西虽然好
Donna, as good as this product is,

566
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,560
以商人对商人的谈话  我明说吧
I'm telling you--as one business person to another--

567
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,340
你做生意还没有积累到信誉
you have no credibility to do this.

568
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,890
相信我  这是你能得到的最好条件了
Believe me, these are the best terms you're gonna get.

569
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,880
你看  这你就错了  斯图
Well...you see, that's where you're wrong, Stu.

570
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,450
因为正如我曾告诉过你的
Because like I told you once before,

571
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,010
我是唐娜
I'm Donna, 

572
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,740
这很棒
this is awesome, 

573
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,740
而我能做得更好
and I can do better.

574
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,720
我希望你能证明我是错的
Well, I hope you prove me wrong.

575
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,180
但同时  我不想让你做找马时骑的驴
But in the meantime, I won't be used as a stalking horse.

576
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,230
这意味着如果你现在走了
Which means if you walk away now,

577
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,960
你以后就别回来找我了
you can't come back to me later.

578
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,150
你不必担心  斯图
Oh, you don't have to worry about that, Stu.

579
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,010
因为我一旦走出那扇门
Because once I walk out that door,

580
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,280
我保证不会再回来了
I promise you I'm not coming back.

581
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,530
真不敢相信
I can't believe you.

582
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,740
听着  迈克  在你开口前
Listen, Mike, before you say anything--

583
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,450
我知道你根本不在乎那些矿工
I know you didn't give a shit about those miners,

584
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,510
但你至少可以
but the least you could've done

585
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,300
坚持一下  给我一点筹码
is stuck around long enough to give me some leverage.

586
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,730
我们别无选择
We had no choice.

587
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,680
帕默给我们的十个顶级客户施压
Palmer pressured ten of our top clients

588
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,220
让他们解雇我们  除非我们放弃
to drop us unless we pulled out.

589
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,290
所以就是选他们还是选我了
So it's either them or me?

590
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,470
除非你能代替他们的三千万账单
Unless you can replace 30 million in billings,

591
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,350
那就是这样
you're damn right it is.

592
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,650
哈维  如果你不帮我
Harvey, without you backing me,

593
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,370
那些矿工就完了
those miners are screwed.

594
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,070
而且我只能束手无策
And there is nothing that I can do about it.

595
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,280
你可以对此有所作为
There's something you can do about it,

596
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,640
你只是不愿意做
you just don't wanna do it.

597
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,660
你说的是那个女人
You're talking about that woman.

598
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,710
你想对帕默施加影响吗
You want leverage on Palmer?

599
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,580
她就是能影响帕默的人
She's the one who's got it.

600
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,710
哈维  我们说过了
Harvey, we've been over this.

601
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,010
我不打算利用那个女人
I'm not gonna use that woman.

602
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,970
如果我告诉你我们已经这样做了呢
And what if I told you we already did?

603
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,020
-什么  -迈克  我们不仅找到了她
- What? - Mike, we not only found her,

604
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,950
还拿到了足以让那混蛋和解的料
we got enough to force that bastard into a settlement.

605
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,200
问题在于  你是否愿意利用它
The question is: are you willing to use it?

606
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,360
你说"我们"是什么意思
What do you mean "We"?

607
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,880
-迈克  -不  你刚刚说了"我们"
- Mike. - No, no, you just said, "We."

608
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,260
"我们"是指谁
Who the hell is "We"?

609
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,760
瑞秋
Rachel.

610
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,860
我和瑞秋
Me and Rachel.

611
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,620
你把瑞秋卷进这件事了
You dragged Rachel into this.

612
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,350
我没有把她卷进任何事
I didn't drag her into anything.

613
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,150
我去征求她的同意  因为我明白你的感受
I went to her for permission because I knew how you felt,

614
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,400
她立刻抓住了这个你因为太蠢而不愿抓的机会
and she jumped at the chance since you're too stupid to.

615
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,750
你没权利这样做
You had no right.

616
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,100
-迈克  听着  -你没有权利
- Mike, listen. - You had no right!

617
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,920
晚安  强尼
Good night, Johnny.

618
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,290
本杰明
Benjamin?

619
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,770
唐娜
Donna.

620
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,690
希望我来你住处找你你不会觉得很奇怪
I hope you don't think it's weird that I came to your place.

621
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,090
你知道我的住处  这让我有点奇怪
Well, I find it a little weird that you know where I live.

622
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,950
我在信息技术部门工作  知道所有人的住处
I work in IT. I know where everyone lives.

623
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,660
但我来这里不是要说这些的
But that's not what I came here to talk about.

624
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,030
你来这里做什么
What did you come here for?

625
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,950
我非常担心明天
I'm freaking out about tomorrow

626
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,270
如果我们还没准备好怎么办
and what if we're not ready?

627
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,180
放松  本杰明  会好的
Relax, Benjamin. It's gonna be fine.

628
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,240
你怎么知道
How can you know that?

629
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,330
因为我已经演练过了
Because I already did a practice run.

630
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,430
你在说什么
What are you talking about? 

631
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,270
我知道有个人可能会投资
There's a guy I know who I thought might invest,

632
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,600
但他并不是做这行的
but he's not really in this business

633
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,800
我带着真・唐娜去找他  游说了一番
so I brought the Donna over to him and I gave him our pitch.

634
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,970
进展顺利吗
And it went okay?

635
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,290
不只是顺利  他给我们报价了
It went more than okay. He made us an offer.

636
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,650
那我们究竟为什么
Then what in God's name do we need

637
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,230
还要这么折磨自己
to put ourselves through this torture for?

638
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,360
我拒绝了他
I turned him down.

639
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,290
等等  什么
Wait -- what?

640
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,930
唐娜  这是我们的梦想
Donna, this is our dream.

641
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,490
我知道  本杰明
I know that, Benjamin.

642
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,250
但他想要90%的所有权
But wanted to own 90% of it,

643
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,000
而我不想放弃我们90%的梦想
and I'm not willing to give up 90% of our dream.

644
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,250
现在回家睡个觉
Now go home and get some sleep, 

645
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,520
因为我们明天是我们的第一次展示会
because we've got our first meeting tomorrow

646
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,260
咱们会大获成功的
and you and I are gonna kick some serious ass.

647
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,210
-你打算什么时候告诉我  -迈克
- When were you gonna tell me? - Mike--

648
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,180
你想过要告诉我吗
Were you ever gonna God damn tell me?

649
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,090
别这样跟我说话
Don't speak to me like that. 

650
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,800
你明知我的态度  却还背着我做这些
You went behind my back when you knew how I felt about this.

651
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,690
不  我背着你做这些
No, I went behind your back

652
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,810
正是因为我明白你的感受
because I knew how you felt about it.

653
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,470
这样就能把你的行为正当化了吗
Is that supposed to make it okay?

654
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,910
不  听着  我才是那个
No, look, I was the one 

655
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,450
不希望冒太大风险的人
that didn't want to let things get too risky,

656
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,190
但是当哈维跟我说过之后
but when Harvey laid it out for me,

657
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,530
我认为这并不是冒险
I decided that it wasn't.

658
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,430
那你为什么不先来找我
Then why didn't you come to me first?

659
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,500
因为你说过
Because you're the one that says

660
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,470
要求原谅比要求许可更容易
forgiveness is easier to ask for than permission.

661
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,160
这个理由太烂了
That's a bullshit reason.

662
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,310
那你怎么不想想  我是为了你才这么做的
Then how about focusing on the fact that I did it for you?

663
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,150
-瑞秋  -迈克  今天早上
- Rachel - Mike, this morning,

664
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,000
当你告诉我已经结束了
when you told me it was over,

665
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,870
你的表情...
the look on your face--

666
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,460
我不希望你的余生都是这样的表情
I don't want you to have that look for the rest of your life.

667
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,340
瑞秋  我那时很沮丧  事情刚刚发生
Rachel, I was upset. It had just happened.

668
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,540
不  迈克  问题就是  它不是刚发生
No, Mike, that's just it. It hadn't.

669
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,280
你背负这些太久了
You've been living with this for so long,

670
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,540
这就是为什么你允许哈维去做这件事
that's why you gave Harvey the go-ahead to begin with.

671
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,840
我那么做是因为我要看着奥利佛失败
I did that because I had to watch Oliver fail

672
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,090
而我无计可施
and there's nothing I could do about it.

673
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,050
如果不是奥利佛
And if it wasn't Oliver,

674
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,310
就会有其他的人
it was going to be someone else.

675
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,620
或者其他的事
Or something else.

676
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,970
总会有什么来提醒你  你不是律师
There's always gonna be some reminder that you weren't a lawyer.

677
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,540
它会逐渐吞噬你
And it would eat away at you,

678
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,650
因为你命中注定要成为律师
because it's what you're meant to be.

679
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,160
你不应该做你做的那些事
You shouldn't have done what you did.

680
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,760
我知道  我背着你做这些你很生气
I know you're mad at me for going behind your back,

681
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,940
但我不会道歉的
but I'm not gonna apologize.

682
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,170
因为我不愿意和一个放弃了梦想的人
Because I don't wanna spend the rest of my life with a man

683
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,630
过一辈子
who gave up on his dreams.

684
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,540
而且我知道你也不愿意当那个人
And I know that you don't wanna be that man either.

685
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,370
路易
Louis?

686
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,180
你在这里做什么
What are you doing in here?

687
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,860
瑞秋  我能跟你谈谈吗
Rachel, can I talk to you a second?

688
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,950
当然
Of course.

689
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,580
我听说迈克不希望卷入那个女人
I heard Mike had a problem involving that woman.

690
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,980
是的
Yes, he did.

691
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,730
我们昨晚其实还为这事吵了架
We actually got into a fight about it last night.

692
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,930
-他什么打算  -我不知道
- What's he gonna do? - I don't know.

693
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,120
但还是要感谢你为了找她做的一切
But thank you for doing whatever you did to find her, anyway.

694
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
没事
Of course.

695
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,060
所以  你来找我什么事
So... what are you doing in here?

696
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,550
你有希望你从来没发现过吗
You ever wish you hadn't found out?

697
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,350
-什么  -你有希望过
- What? - You ever wish

698
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,050
你从来没发现迈克的秘密吗
you never known about Mike's secret?

699
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,550
或者再远点  从来没遇到过他
Or, for that matter, never even met him?

700
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,220
路易  到底怎么了
Louis, what's going on?

701
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,430
塔拉和我最近一直在交流生活
Tara and I have been sharing a lot lately.

702
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,640
但我还是有没告诉她的事
But there's still things I haven't told her.

703
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,800
昨天  她问我我为什么心情不好
Yesterday, she asked me what I was having a bad day about.

704
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,740
而事实是  就是因为迈克的事
And the truth is, it was pretty much about Mike.

705
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,670
而且我想告诉她  但是...
And I want to tell her about it, but--

706
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,580
你不知道她会作何反应
You don't know how she'll react.

707
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,530
是的  我甚至都不敢告诉她
No, I don't. I still haven't even told her

708
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,460
在迈克事发前我就知道他的秘密
I knew about Mike's secret before he got caught,

709
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,400
更别说我还利用他的秘密当了冠名合伙人
let alone the fact that I used it to get made partner.

710
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,170
-路易  -瑞秋  当时被希拉发现时
- Louis... - Rachel, when Sheila found out,

711
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,260
她说我再也不是她的灵魂伴侣了
she said I wasn't her soul mate anymore.

712
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,200
但那是希拉  路易
But that was Sheila, Louis.

713
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,620
而且关键字是  被她发现
And the key phrase is "She found out."

714
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,170
不是你主动告诉她的
You didn't tell her.

715
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,020
所以迈克告诉你的时候你就不生气吗
So you were okay when Mike told you?

716
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,030
不  我不能说我完全没有生气
No, I wouldn't say that I was okay with it.

717
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,620
但我爱他
But I love him.

718
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,540
所以我原谅了他
That's why I forgave him.

719
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,950
我不能保证塔拉会原谅你
I can't guarantee that Tara will forgive you,

720
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,150
但我肯定如果哪天被她自己发现了
but I can tell you that if she finds out some other way,

721
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,690
那她肯定不会原谅你了
then she won't.

722
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,040
谢谢  瑞秋
Thank you, Rachel.

723
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,870
谢谢你能陪我谈谈这件事
I appreciate your time.

724
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,520
谢谢答应和我们见面
Thank you for sitting down with us.

725
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,690
很荣幸  我是安德鲁  这是拉塞尔
It's our pleasure. I'm Andrew and this is Russell.

726
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,020
-我是唐娜  -我叫本杰明
- I'm Donna. - And my name is Benjamin.

727
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,080
介意我叫你本吗
Mind if I call you Ben? 

728
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,060
说实话  非常介意
Yes, actually, I mind very much.

729
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,110
但只要你打开支票本签了我们
But you open up that checkbook of yours,

730
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,870
你想怎么叫本都可以
and you can call Ben here whatever the hell you want.

731
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,140
谢谢  但开始前
I appreciate that, but before we get started,

732
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,530
你要知道  我们一个月
you should know that we get pitched

733
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,640
能得到六个个人助手设备的提案
six personal assistant devices a month.

734
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,220
你也要知道我们的设备
And you should know that our device

735
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,030
能让Siri和Alexa黯然失色
makes Siri and the Alexa look like toaster ovens.

736
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,970
也许如此
Well, that may be the case, 

737
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,130
但我担心市场已经饱和了
but I'm concerned that the market is already saturated.

738
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:06,870
你要真担心
If you were so concerned, 

739
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,730
那就不会接受这次面谈了
you wouldn't be sitting here in the first place.

740
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,030
-是吗  -是的
- Is that a fact? - Yes, it is.

741
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,500
因为你是投资部的老大
Because you're the head of the investment team,

742
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,990
老大是不会随便浪费时间的
and the head of the team doesn't waste his time

743
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,860
除非他觉得有利可图
unless he thinks there might be something in it for him.

744
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,640
我图的利也不一定就非是投资
There might be other things in it for me than just investing.

745
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,150
确实
Yes, there could.

746
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,560
权利斗争就有可能
Like marking your territory.

747
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,180
因为看到你们俩坐在这儿谁都能看出
Because anybody can see by the way you two are sitting there

748
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,790
他想夺你的位子  而且你对此非常不爽
that he's gunning for your job and you don't like that one bit.

749
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,800
-不是的...  -谁告诉你的
- That's not-- - Who told you that?

750
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,600
没人告诉我
No one told me that.

751
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,140
就像也没人告诉我你不能解雇他
Just like no one told me that you can't fire him

752
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,470
因为这会显得你很软弱一样
because that'll make you look weak.

753
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,500
所以你才接受了这次面谈
Which is why you took this meeting.

754
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,390
因为你不愿意他单独来见我们
Because you didn't want him taking it without you.

755
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,620
好吧  你到底是怎么做到的
Okay, how in the hell are you doing all this?

756
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,580
我能做到因为我是唐娜
I'm doing this because I'm Donna.

757
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,700
如果你们还没明白  这个设备也是唐娜
And if it hasn't dawned on you already, so is this device.

758
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,780
所以  你们是想继续鼓着劲搞办公室政治
Now, do you wanna puff up your chest and play office politics,

759
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,230
还是想听一个能让你们
or do you wanna hear about an opportunity

760
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,710
都步步高升的好机会
that could vault you both to the top of the ladder?

761
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,700
不如请你给我们介绍一下你的产品
Why don't you tell us about your product?

762
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,590
请给我一杯黑咖啡
Can I get a black coffee?

763
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,760
他要的来两份
Make it two of whatever he's having.

764
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,820
你又来骂我背着你
You here to tell me what a dick I am

765
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,840
行动的事太混蛋了吗
for going behind your back again?

766
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,480
不是  我来问你什么时候去见帕默
No, I'm here to find out what time your meeting with Palmer is.

767
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,670
不知道
I don't know.

768
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,130
什么叫你不知道
What do you mean, you don't know?

769
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,110
因为没有你的允许我不打算行动
Well, I wasn't gonna do it without your permission.

770
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,840
所以就是说我没跟帕默约时间呢
Which means there is no meeting with Palmer.

771
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,550
那我现在允许了
Well, I'm giving you my permission.

772
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,270
迈克  不是我抱怨
Mike, I'm not trying to be an asshole,

773
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,510
但我们费了好大的功夫才拿到帕默的把柄
but we went to a lot of trouble to get that shit on Palmer

774
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,190
结果你一副想杀我的样子
and you looked like you wanted to kill me.

775
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,310
我怎么知道这次你就不会后悔了
So how do I know you're not gonna wanna change your mind?

776
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,390
因为我想当律师
'Cause I wanna be a lawyer.

777
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,740
我不在乎用什么方法办到
I don't care how we do it.

778
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,240
钱包拿出来  把我的帐付了
Take out your wallet, pay for this coffee,

779
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,940
然后我们一起拿下这件事
and let's bring this thing home.

780
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,100
那是我这辈子最非凡的27分钟
Well, that was the most amazing 27 minutes of my entire life.

781
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,300
哪部分非凡啊
Which part?

782
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,030
是你坐在那一句话也说不出来
When you sat there with your mouth glued shut

783
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,290
还是讲到运行系统掉链子的时候
or when you shit the bed describing the operating system?

784
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,010
天  就知道说到设计规格的时候就该闭嘴了
Oh, my God, I knew I should have stopped after the design specs.

785
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,460
本杰明  我逗你玩的
Benjamin, I'm teasing you.

786
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,330
我真的不知道这句话可信不可信
Now I don't know if I should believe you.

787
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,610
那你听好了
Then listen to me carefully.

788
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,760
你棒极了
You killed it.

789
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,330
谢谢  但是  其实是我们棒极了
Thank you. But, in fact, we killed it.

790
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,400
一点没错  是我们
You're damn right, we did.

791
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,060
你先走吧  我们回公司再见
Now get going, I'm gonna see you back at the firm.

792
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,770
你要去哪
Where are you going?

793
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,080
我不小心把笔忘在会议室了
I accidentally forgot my pen in the conference room.

794
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,250
我可以借你一支
Oh, I have one you can borrow.

795
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,430
本杰明  当我说不小心时
Benjamin, when I say accidentally,

796
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,420
我的意思是我故意忘在了那里
I mean intentionally 

797
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,570
好找个借口回去在门口偷听
because it gives me an excuse to go back in there

798
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,400
他们是怎么谈论我们的
and eavesdrop on what they're saying about us.

799
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,270
好主意  让我一起去吧
Oh, that's a great idea. Can I come with you?

800
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,590
-不  我得一个人去  -为什么
- No, I need to do this alone. - Why?

801
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,960
因为当他们看到只有我回去时
Because when they see me without you,

802
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,470
会觉得他们二对一占优势
they're gonna think it's two against one

803
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,160
所以会向我提议甩掉你单干
and they'll make me an offer to cut you out.

804
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,930
等等  你真觉得他们会那么做
Wait, you actually think they would do that?

805
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,690
当然  这些家伙可是腐肉都不放过的秃鹫
Of course they will. These guys are vultures.

806
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,810
那我不该跟你一起回去  阻止他们吗
Well, then shouldn't I go with you so we can stop it?

807
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,380
你相信我吗
Do you trust me?

808
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,520
当然
Yes, I do.

809
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,460
那就相信我  他们会给我开价
Then trust when they make me the offer,

810
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,610
我会表现出愤怒的样子
I'm gonna act outraged, 

811
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,040
告诉他们我们绝不跟他们合作
tell them we'll never do business with them, 

812
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,470
他们就会给我们再加百分之五
and they'll give us an extra 5% right there.

813
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,270
-你觉得呢  -我觉得很惊人
- So what'd you think? - I thought it was impressive.

814
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,320
那你们也太容易惊讶了
Oh, then I think you're easily impressed.

815
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,770
-你不喜欢吗  -我还行
- You didn't like it? - I liked it just fine.

816
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,440
但你知道推出一款这样的技术
But do you know how much it costs to roll out

817
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,360
要花多少钱吗
a piece of tech like that?

818
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,310
从工程设计到试用机
Between the engineering design, and beta testing.

819
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,990
要花太多钱
It costs a ton of money.

820
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,610
是你说要先花钱才能赚钱的
Hey, you're the one who says you gotta spend money to make money.

821
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,030
我还说过投项目就是投人
I also said when you fund a project, you fund the person.

822
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,890
所以相信我  我不会投资那个女人
And the truth is, I'm not funding that woman.

823
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,220
那我们为什么还要见他们
So, why'd we take this meeting?

824
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,920
给哈维・斯佩克特送人情
Took it as a favor to Harvey Specter.

825
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,160
如果她要开柠檬水站
Now, if she was starting up a lemonade stand,

826
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,320
我可能会投点钱进去
I might throw in a few bucks.

827
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,890
但我绝对不可能跟一个律师秘书
But there is no way in hell I'm getting into business

828
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,080
一起创业
with a career legal secretary.

829
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,310
理解了
You don't have to tell me twice.

830
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,910
-要去吃饭吗  -喝一杯也行
- You wanna grab some lunch? - Yeah, and maybe a drink.

831
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,420
我绷着脸坐了这么久
I feel like I deserve it after having to

832
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,080
也应该来一杯犒劳一下自己
sit through that with a straight face.

833
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,810
詹姆  俱乐部选得不错
Hey, Jimbo, nice club.

834
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,530
但在我看来木器太多了
A little heavy on the wood for my taste.

835
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,670
对我来说是蠢货有点多
A little heavy on the douche bag for mine.

836
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,670
你怎么进来的
How did you get in here?

837
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,480
我跟他们说我是你表弟
I told them I was your cousin.

838
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,840
有点坏消息  你需要知道
We had some bad news and you were gonna wanna hear about it.

839
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,940
-胡说  -表弟那部分是胡说
- Bullshit. - Maybe not the cousin part,

840
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,530
但消息是这样的
but here's the news:

841
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,570
我们抓到了你的把柄
we got your balls in a vice.

842
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
-只有一个解决办法  -是呀
- There's only one way out. - The hell you do.

843
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:07,550
既然你决定跑回这里了
And since you decided to just wade back into this,

844
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,770
你那六个客户就没了
those six clients of yours are gone.

845
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,440
我不这么想  瘦子吉姆
Mm. Don't think so, Slim Jim.

846
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,150
你看  你第一次差点难住我们
See, the only reason you almost got to us in the first place

847
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,500
是因为你发现了我的阿基里斯之踵
was you found my Achilles Heel.

848
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,140
但我们现在发现了你的
But then we found yours.

849
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,780
我得说  她确实很漂亮
I gotta say, she sure is pretty.

850
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,180
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

851
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,320
这个说不定能提醒你
Maybe this'll jog your memory.

852
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,090
姓名  日期  电话  邮件
Names, dates, phone numbers, emails,

853
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,740
银行账户  金钱往来
bank statements, wire transfers.

854
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,720
能证明超过一打的
Proof of over a dozen instances

855
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,500
商业间谍行为
of you committing corporate espionage.

856
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,860
我们的幸运之处在于  她不仅漂亮
Lucky for us, she isn't just pretty,

857
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,260
还喜欢什么都记下来
she's a hell of a bookkeeper.

858
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,210
你们想要什么
What do you want?

859
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,210
要你一开始就该做的事
For you to do what you should have done in the first place.

860
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,970
跟那些矿工以两亿美金和解
You're gonna settle with those miners for 200 million.

861
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,660
你忘记听说过我们或者科伦维尔女士的事
You're gonna forget you ever heard of us or Ms. Cromwell.

862
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,640
并且继续诚实履行跟克雷格・塞德尔
And you're gonna honor your original agreement

863
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,490
原本达成的协议
with Craig Seidel.

864
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,650
你干嘛要关心那只黄鼠狼的将来
What do you care about that weasel's future for?

865
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,820
这是我跟他的事
That's between me and him.

866
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,190
还有件事
Oh, one other thing.

867
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,140
这才是个真的过这个村没这个店的交易
This really is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

868
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,300
15秒后失效
Expires in 15 seconds.

869
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,680
等你签了
And once it's signed,

870
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,710
我永远不想听到你的破公司
I never wanna hear about your shitty little company

871
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,660
再做这样的事情
doing something like this ever again.

872
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,390
好了
There you are.

873
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,730
那个会后你去哪了
Where have you been since that meeting?

874
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,650
我一直在想一些事
I've been doing some thinking.

875
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,950
而我整天都在担心我的合伙人是不是出卖了我
And I've been wondering if my partner sold me out all day.

876
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,190
本杰明  我不想告诉你
Well...I hate to break it to you, Benjamin,

877
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,420
但事实完全相反
but that's actually the opposite of what happened.

878
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,140
什么意思
What do you mean?

879
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,670
他们不想提合作
I mean...they don't want to make us an offer.

880
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,860
事实上  他们不想跟真・唐娜有任何关系
In fact, they don't want anything to do with The Donna.

881
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,370
-是我的错  对吗  -本杰明
- It's my fault, isn't it? - Benjamin--

882
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,960
你不必保护我的感情
You don't have to protect my feelings.

883
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,920
链条的强度要看最薄弱的一环
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link,

884
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,440
我知道那就是我
and I know that's what I am.

885
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,240
不  不是你
No, you're not.

886
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,020
事实上是我
It turns out I am.

887
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:53,870
听我说
Listen to me.

888
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,180
你制造了不可思议的产品
You have designed an incredible product.

889
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,880
我不想拖你的后退
And I don't want to hold you back.

890
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,440
所以  现在我要解散我们的合伙关系
Which is why, as of right now, I am dissolving our partnership

891
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,060
好让你一个人发布它
so you can take it out on your own.

892
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,570
你这是要去哪
Where the hell do you think you're going?

893
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,450
我们是合伙人  没有你
We're partners--I'd rather throw

894
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,870
我宁愿把真・唐娜丢进海里
The Donna into the ocean than move forward without you.

895
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,600
本杰明  拜托
Benjamin, please.

896
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,410
别做牺牲者
Don't be a martyr.

897
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,770
我不是在做牺牲者
I'm not being a martyr.

898
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,440
我是在做合伙人
I'm being a partner.

899
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,910
我们要一起做  要不就都退出
We're in this together or not at all.

900
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,850
所以就只看你了
So it's up to you.

901
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,070
我们是要放弃梦想
Are we gonna give up on our dream

902
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,140
还是继续为它奋斗
or live to fight another day?

903
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,780
继续奋斗  本杰明
Live to fight, Benjamin.

904
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,360
继续奋斗
Live to fight.

905
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,340
你又来
Again?

906
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,770
这次又是什么鬼事
What the hell is it this time?

907
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,850
跟上次一样的事
Same thing as it was last time.

908
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,420
我需要你帮我争取听证会
I need you to get that hearing back for me.

909
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,250
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me? 

910
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,390
你知道第一次惹了多少麻烦吗
You know how much trouble it was the first time?

911
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,530
我不关心有多少麻烦
I don't care how much trouble it was.

912
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,430
你得再做一次
You're gonna do it again.

913
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,500
当然  除非你不想要
Unless, of course, you don't want the original terms

914
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,040
你跟帕默原来的协议了
of your deal with Palmer upheld.

915
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,670
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

916
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,950
我们让他保证了付你原本承诺的金额
We had him guarantee to pay you what he promised

917
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,040
并在本季度结束后雇佣你
and to hire you over there at the end of the quarter.

918
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,410
你们为什么这么做
Why would you do that?

919
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,080
因为我不仅想让你敲定听证
'Cause I don't just want you to set that hearing,

920
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,370
我想让你帮我清除掉所有拦路的人
I want you to bulldoze anyone who stands in my way.

921
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,590
选择权在你
Look, it's up to you.

922
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,790
你拿钱和工作  让我进去
You take the job and the money and you get me in

923
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,280
或者坐在要沉的船上  等他们
or you stay on a sinking ship and wait for them to figure out

924
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,640
发现你就是弄沉它的人
that you're the one who sank it.

925
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,190
我会做到
I'll make it happen.

926
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,350
没错  我也觉得
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

927
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,500
我以为你现在正在找乐子呢
I would've thought you'd be at happy hour by now.

928
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,600
这些天我的乐子只在
These days my happy hour is the 60 minutes

929
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,700
从我回家到昏睡过去之间的60分钟
from the time I get home to the time I pass out.

930
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,060
你真是工作狂  斯图
You're a hard worker, Stu.

931
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,950
事实是世界不会为看脸付钱
Turns out they don't just give you money for your looks.

932
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,800
但你肯定不是跑这么远来告诉我
But you didn't come all the way back here

933
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,500
我有多努力的
just to tell me how hard I work.

934
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,520
我来看看你愿不愿意重新考虑
I came to see if you'd reconsider.

935
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,020
你没能搞定  是吗
You couldn't beat it, could you?

936
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,110
是  但我不是因为这才来
No. But that's not why I'm here.

937
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,450
那是为什么
Then why are you here?

938
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,340
因为虽然我不喜欢你的条件
Because even though I didn't like your terms,

939
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,580
但你平等对待我  尊重我
you spoke to me as an equal and you treated me with respect

940
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,060
而我想跟这样的人合作做生意
and that's the kind of person I want to be in business with.

941
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,170
如果我说
What would you say

942
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,560
我的提议还在呢
if I told you the offer was back on the table?

943
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,880
我会说我猜条件
I'd say my assumption is the terms won't be

944
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,450
不会像上次一样好了
as good as they were the first time around.

945
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,540
条件不变
The terms aren't gonna change.

946
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,780
为什么
Why not?

947
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,220
因为我不想让和我合伙做生意的人
Because I don't want to go into business with someone

948
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,210
觉得我就是为了坑他们
who feels like I'm giving them the shaft.

949
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,880
我乐意跟喜欢我
I wanna go into business with someone 

950
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,340
做合伙人的人合作
who's happywith my partnership.

951
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,270
谢谢  斯图
Thank you, Stu.

952
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,470
不客气  唐娜
You're welcome, Donna.

953
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,690
而且跟你说
Oh, and just so you know,

954
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,560
我说要付诸行动
when I put my money where my mouth is,

955
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,600
就会投入一切
I throw everything I have into it.

956
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,470
那既然你敢说这么大的话
I wouldn't expect anything less

957
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,450
我也就不担心了
from a big mouth like you.

958
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,840
搞定了
Done?

959
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,920
搞定了
Done.

960
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,590
我得说
I gotta say, 

961
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,260
有你做律师  世界会好一点
the world's gonna be a better place with you as a lawyer.

962
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,410
为什么  因为我们强迫了某些混蛋
Why? 'Cause we just strong-armed some jackass

963
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,600
做了我们想要的事吗
into doing what what we want?

964
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,500
不  因为你不惜一切代价
No, because you did what it took

965
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,330
给那些矿工争取了他们应得的
to get those miners what they deserve.

966
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,510
说到这个  你喝完酒想跟我来吗
Speaking of which, you wanna come with me after this?

967
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,250
-去哪  -去告诉那些矿工
- Where you going? - To tell those miners

968
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,280
世上最好的律师  帮他们争取到了应得的
that the world's best lawyer just got them what they deserve.

969
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,810
-是第二好  -没什么区别
- Second best. - Ah, potato/potahto.

970
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,160
说真的  迈克  还是你去吧
Seriously, Mike, you go tell them.

971
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,130
另外  说完之后
Besides, after that,

972
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,290
你得为听证会做准备了
you've got some preparing to do for that hearing.

973
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:29,890
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

974
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,450
我已经说了  塞德尔搞定这事了
I just told you, Seidel's got it in the bag.

975
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,510
你要觉得这事不会出问题
And if you think there isn't gonna be some kind of hitch,

976
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,690
-那我真什么都没教会你  -如果你觉得
- I haven't taught you shit. - If you think whatever it is,

977
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,070
我没法处理要出的事  那就是没注意我
I can't handle it, then you have not been paying attention.

978
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,670
你是说你把自己处理进监狱的事吗
You mean like when you handled yourself into going to prison?

979
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,960
不  我是说我一身玫瑰香出来
No, I mean when I came out smelling like a rose.

980
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,870
你出来的时候我在
Hey, I was there when you came out.

981
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,660
你那个味道肯定不是玫瑰香
And rose wasn't the aroma you were emanating.

982
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,290
没错
You're right.

983
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,700
我那个味道是完美
I was emanating awesome.

984
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,820
你真是很像我啊  对吧
You really are like me, aren't you?

985
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,210
真不幸  是的
Unfortunately.

986
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,860
欢迎回到律师圈  迈克
Welcome back to the Bar, Mike.

987
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,010
谢谢  哈维
Thanks, Harvey.

988
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,270
严格说  我还没进过  
Technically, I wasn't really in. 

989
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,110
-是  你从没真正有过资格  -是的呢
- Actually, you weren't really work in the Bar, ever. - Yeah.

990
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,760
我想问你今天过的怎么样
I'd ask how your day was,

991
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,270
但我上次问的时候  结果不太好
but last time I did that, it didn't go very well.

992
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,340
塔拉  我能跟你说实话吗
Tara, can I be honest with you?

993
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,890
当然  你可以跟我说任何事
Of course. You can tell me anything.

994
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,340
这是我们相互了解的一部分  我说过的
It's part of getting to know each other--I told you that.

995
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,370
我只是不确定你想不想听这个
Just not sure that this is what you had in mind.

996
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,330
路易  怎么了
Louis, what is going on?

997
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,400
那天
The other day, 

998
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,720
我不想跟你说我为什么不高兴
when I didn't want to tell you what I was upset about,

999
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,830
我是在思考
I was trying to figure out

1000
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,510
帮迈克・罗斯拿到律师资格的办法
a way to get Mike Ross into the Bar.

1001
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,370
你是说在你们律所工作过的那个诈骗犯
You mean the fraud who worked at your firm?

1002
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,230
说来话长  但我们是朋友  事情也过去了
It's a long story, but we're friends now and we're past it.

1003
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,100
说来话长是什么意思
What do you mean it's a long story?

1004
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,950
我是说迈克被捕前我就知道他的诈骗行为
I mean I knew Mike was a fraud before he was arrested.

1005
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,110
我不仅知道
And I didn't just know.

1006
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,550
我发现之后
When I found out about him,

1007
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,530
不仅没有报案
instead of going to the police,

1008
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,910
或者报告律师协会
or going to the Bar,

1009
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,010
我还利用这事当上了冠名合伙人
I leveraged it to get my name on the wall.

1010
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,370
塔拉  你说话呀
Tara, say something.

1011
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,300
说什么
Say what?

1012
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,050
你刚告诉我你发现了自己跟罪犯同事
You just told me you found out you were working with a criminal

1013
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,150
却利用这信息升职
and you turned it into a promotion.

1014
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,490
我知道  但你说我们要相互了解
I know that, but you said we should get to know each other.

1015
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,640
你想要我说什么  路易
What do you want me to say, Louis?

1016
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,540
我是说不知道你最喜欢的电影是什么
I didn't know what your favorite movie was.

1017
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,300
或者你喜欢床的哪一边
Or what side of the bed you like.

1018
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,710
但我以为至少我知道你的为人
But I thought at least I knew what kind of man you were.

1019
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,620
塔拉  拜托
Tara, please.

1020
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,450
这是我一生最羞愧的事
This is the thing I'm most ashamed aboutin my life

1021
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,480
我告诉你是想让你知道
and I'm telling you to show you 

1022
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,830
我永远不会瞒你任何事
that I'm never gonna hide anything from you. 

1023
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,660
-或许你应该瞒  -什么
- Well, maybe you should hide some things from me. - What?

1024
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,910
你听到了
You heard me.

1025
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,490
是听到了
I heard you.

1026
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,840
在我发现了你的事情之后
How dare you say that to me after 

1027
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,730
你怎么敢这样跟我说
what I had to find out about you.

1028
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,030
这是什么意思
What is that supposed to mean?

1029
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,540
意思是你坐在那儿
It means you're sitting there

1030
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,990
说话好像你是最有道德的高等祭司
like you're the high priestess of moral authority,

1031
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,800
可我们第一次上床时
when the first time we slept together,

1032
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,180
你还跟别人好着呢
you were with another man.

1033
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,980
你怎么能这么跟我说话
How can you say that to me?

1034
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,920
那是我跟你  跟他都坦白的情况下
I was up front about it with you and with him.

1035
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,360
你跟全世界都坦白了
You were up front about it with everybody

1036
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,910
之后你想要我跟你坦白
and then you wanted me to be up front with you about things.

1037
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,200
可你现在像看怪物一样看我
And now you're looking at me like I'm a monster!

1038
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,480
好了  就这样吧
You know what? That's it.

1039
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,380
就这样  你要去哪
That's it-- well, where are you going?

1040
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,770
我回我的家睡
I'm sleeping at my place tonight.

1041
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,740
塔拉  拜托
Look, Tara, please.

1042
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,920
如果我知道你会是这个反应
If I knew that you were gonna react this way,

1043
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,270
绝不会告诉你这些
I never would have told you any of this.

1044
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,730
但你告诉我了  路易
But you did tell me, Louis.

1045
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,790
-晚安  -塔拉  等等
- Good night. - Tara, wait.

1046
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,290
我会给你打电话
I'll give you a call

1047
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,220
等我想清楚之后
when I've had a chance to figure things out.
