{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,560
我可不欠哈维什么
I don't owe Harvey shit.

16
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,570
也许是他还了我的清白
He may have gotten me out,

17
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,140
但当初他也是卡梅隆的帮凶
but he and Cameron put me in there in the first place.

18
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,460
没错  你不欠哈维的
You're right, you don't owe Harvey,

19
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,420
但你欠我的  因为你被冤枉的事
but you do owe me because I didn't have anything

20
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,400
跟我没有关系
to do with putting you in there,

21
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,940
可我不惜违法把你救了出来
but I broke the law to get you out.

22
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,620
我是来夸奖你摆脱希拉・赛斯的方式的
I came here to compliment you on getting rid of Sheila Sazs.

23
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,050
如果她在庭审前没有回来
If she's not back by the start of trial,

24
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,510
我会认为你想被起诉
I'm gonna assume you want to be brought up on charges.

25
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,660
我只是过来给你这个限制令
I just stopped by to give you this restraining order

26
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,500
阻止你在路易・利特的律师不在场的情况下接触他
preventing you from contacting Louis Litt.

27
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,670
你休想再继续挑拨我和我的人了
You're done driving a wedge between me and my people.

28
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,180
如果我为自己辩护  那我在庭上的每一秒
If I represent myself, every second I'm up there

29
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,340
他们都会看到我就是个律师
they're gonna see me as a lawyer.

30
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,670
但如果她在其中任何一刻
And if she rattles you

31
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,460
打乱你的阵脚
For one of those goddamn seconds,

32
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,660
他们就会认为你是个骗子
they're gonna see you as a fraud

33
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,400
并且再也不会看到你的其他方面
and they're never gonna see you as anything else.

34
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,410
迈克・罗斯有没有到哈佛大学法学院上过学
Did Mike Ross go to Harvard Law School or not?

35
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,610
我要使用宪法第五修正案赋予我的权利
I'd like to assert my Fifth Amendment right.

36
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,430
如果我在陪审团  我会认定你有罪
If I was on that jury, I'd find you guilty.

37
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,520
他们不会允许我
They're not gonna let me change my goddamn lawyer

38
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,510
在庭审过程换律师的
in the middle of a trial.

39
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,190
我们得想办法让他们允许
We need to figure out a way to make them,

40
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,200
因为如果我们想不出  就会输
'cause if we don't, we're gonna lose.

41
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,960
你有最后一个自救的机会
You have one last chance to save yourself.

42
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,840
打电话给我  以免太迟了
Call me before it's too late.

43
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,570
好了  我们有一个计划
Okay, so we have a plan for you

44
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,580
可以让你开始为自己辩护
to start representing yourself.

45
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,260
还缺个能在执行时乱了吉布斯阵脚的办法
We just need a way to rattle Gibbs when we execute it.

46
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,690
我有个办法  但是
I have a way, but...

47
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,270
你不会喜欢的
you're not gonna like it.

48
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,970
我要让克利福德・丹纳出庭作证
I'm gonna call Clifford Danner to the stand.

49
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,320
不行  太冒险了
No way, it's too risky.

50
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,640
-哈维  听我说  -他很愤怒还不稳定
- Harvey, listen to me-- - he's angry and volatile

51
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,000
而且我提醒你
and in case you forgot,

52
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,560
你曾经蠢到把你的秘密告诉别人
he's one of the people you were dumb enough

53
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,450
他就是其中之一
to tell your secret to. 

54
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,420
这些我都知道
I know all of that,

55
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,470
但你自己也说  我们需要同情
but you said it yourself, we need sympathy,

56
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,460
没有人比我们从监狱里救出来的无辜之人
and no one is gonna get us more sympathy

57
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,160
更能给我们挣到同情了
than the innocent guy we got out of prison.

58
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,840
哈维  你说过这件事我必须自己去做
Harvey, you said I needed to do this.

59
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,550
这就是我做事的方式
Well, this is how I do it.

60
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,310
你对我有信心吗
Do you have faith in me or not?

61
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,650
格洛丽亚・丹纳夫人吗
Mrs. Gloria Danner?

62
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,990
-是的  -你好  我叫迈克・罗斯
- Yes. - Hi, my name is Mike Ross.

63
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,830
我是皮-斯-利律师事务所的律师  我想
I'm a lawyer at Pearson Specter Litt and I was hoping--

64
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,170
我知道你是谁
I know who you are,

65
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,630
我也知道你来做什么
and I know what you're doing here.

66
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,690
你是来让克利福德出庭为你作证的
You've come to get Clifford to testify for you,

67
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,300
但他恐怕去不了
but I'm afraid he's not going to.

68
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,650
拜托了  女士  我保证
Please, ma'am, I promise you,

69
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,890
地检官不能重开他的案子
the D.A. cannot reopen his case--

70
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,300
我不是怕地检官
I'm not talking about the district attorney.

71
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,200
我儿子死了  罗斯先生
My son's dead, Mr. Ross.

72
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,050
什么
What?

73
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,060
克利福德三周前被枪杀了  所以
Clifford was shot and killed three weeks ago, so...

74
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,110
很抱歉  他帮不了你了
I'm sorry, he can't help you.

75
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,300
-你好  -你在办公室吗
- Hello? - Are you in the office?

76
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,260
现在是周四晚上  我在看我的节目
It's Thursday night. I'm watching my show.

77
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,590
录下来晚点看  我需要你帮忙
Well, then goddamn tivo it because I need your help.

78
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,320
你用这种语气跟我说话  最好事情很重要
It better be important if you're taking that tone with me.

79
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,180
如果这是麻将馆的事...
And if this is about that mah-jongg game--

80
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,750
我才不在乎什么该死的麻将
I don't give a shit if it's mah-jongg

81
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,910
宫爆鸡丁还是跳棋
or kung pao or chinese checkers.

82
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,090
这是你这一辈子
This is the most important thing

83
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,190
我会让你做的最重要的事
that I'm ever gonna ask you to do in your entire life.

84
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,420
给我下命令吧
Give me an order.

85
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,100
我要你用尽一切办法
I need you to pull whatever strings you have

86
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,820
帮我搞到迈克这个案子的庭审记录
to get me a transcript of Mike's trial

87
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,290
并且对此保密
and I need you to keep it to yourself.

88
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,740
介意我问一下你要这个做什么吗
Mind if I ask what you need it for?

89
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,170
因为我得知道我们有没有一丁点机会
Because I need to know if we have a snowball's chance in hell

90
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,210
打赢这个官司
of winning this thing.

91
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,580
辩方准备好传唤第一位证人了吗
Is defense ready to call its first witness?

92
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,750
准备好了  法官大人
I am, Your Honor. 

93
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,580
什么
What?

94
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,630
我要传唤证人了
I'm calling my witness.

95
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,340
控方对此有什么疑问吗
Does prosecution have a problem with that?

96
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,970
反对  这太过分了  法官大人
Objection, this is outrageous, Your Honor.

97
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,780
他们不能在庭审中途换律师
They can't switch attorneys in the middle of a trial.

98
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,530
你说得对  但事实上
And that would be true except for the fact

99
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,570
我从一开始就是这个案子的联席律师
that I've been co-counsel on this case from day one.

100
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,430
联席律师  你在说什么
Co-counsel? What planer are you living on?

101
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,950
皮-斯-利律师事务所是我的辩护律师
The one where Pearson Specter Litt is my attorney of record.

102
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,780
这是员工任务分配书
I have the employee directory right here.

103
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,750
里面有我的名字
My name is in it. 

104
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,510
此案开审以来就在这里了
It's been there since the beginning of this trial,

105
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,790
你如果想要反对我
and if you wanted to object to me,

106
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,770
应该在开庭的时候
you would have had to have done it

107
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,390
就提出反对
at the beginning of this trial.

108
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,300
那我要他们放弃一切申请无效审判的权利
Then I want them waiving all rights to a mistrial

109
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,400
并且记录在案
and I want it in the record. 

110
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,560
法官大人  我不能因为
Your Honor, I'm not gonna be punished 

111
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,630
她不知道我从头到尾
just because she didn't understand

112
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,880
都是自己的辩护律师而受到惩罚
that I've been representing myself this whole time.

113
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,090
他说得有道理  吉布斯女士
He's got a point, Ms. Gibbs.

114
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,160
那基于他为自己辩护的基础上
Then I want them waiving all rights to a mistrial

115
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,970
我要他们放弃一切申请无效审判的权利
based on him representing himself.

116
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,600
乐意之至  法官大人  因为我根本
My pleasure, Your Honor, 'cause I don't expect

117
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,140
不认为我们需要申请无效审判
we'll be needing a mistrial at all.

118
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,660
那就传唤你的第一个证人吧
Then call your first witness.

119
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,290
辩方请求传唤格洛丽亚・丹纳出庭作证
Defense would like to call Gloria Danner to the stand.

120
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,190
请告诉陪审团你的姓名
Please state your name for the jury.

121
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,110
格洛丽亚・丹纳
Gloria Danner.

122
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,550
丹纳夫人
Mrs. Danner,

123
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,810
数年前  你的儿子克利福德
A number of years ago, your son Clifford

124
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,690
被判谋杀罪入狱
was convicted of murder and sentenced to prison,

125
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,360
-对吗  -是的
- is that right? - Yes.

126
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,120
他是无辜入狱的
For a crime he didn't commit.

127
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,430
如果他被判有罪
How do you know he didn't commit it

128
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,670
你怎么知道他是无辜的呢
if he was convicted of it?

129
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,430
因为你证明了他无罪
Because you proved he didn't.

130
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,400
丹纳女士  你能告诉陪审团
Mrs. Danner, can you tell the jury

131
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,630
为什么今天是你出庭作证
why it is that you're here today testifying

132
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,160
而不是你儿子克利福德吗
and not your son Clifford?

133
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,210
他那天在餐馆加班
He was working late at the diner.

134
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,810
那是他出狱之后唯一能找到的工作
It was the only place he could get a job when he got out.

135
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,320
有两个人来抢劫餐馆
Two men came in to rob the place,

136
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,190
克利福德想要阻止他们
and when Clifford tried to stop them,

137
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,130
结果被枪杀了
he was shot and killed.

138
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,690
我深表遗憾
I'm so sorry.

139
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,280
我这辈子含辛茹苦
I worked my whole life

140
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,000
供他上学
to put him through school

141
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,090
结果他却死在
and he ends up dying

142
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,250
那家破餐馆
in the back of that shit restaurant

143
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,330
死在那么个破地方
in that shit part of town.

144
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,190
你能告诉陪审团你今天为什么
Can you tell the jury why you agreed

145
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,270
愿意过来为我分享你的故事吗
to come share your story for me today?

146
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,490
监狱
Prison

147
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,430
毁了克利福德的一生
ruined Clifford's life...

148
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,390
如果你从一开始就是我们的律师的话
And if you had been our lawyer from day one,

149
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,850
他根本不会被判有罪
he never would have been convicted in the first place.

150
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,960
谢谢你  格洛丽亚
Thank you, Gloria.

151
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,090
没有其他问题了  法官大人
No more questions, Your Honor.

152
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,580
丹纳女士
Mrs. Danner,

153
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,410
我恰好很熟悉你儿子的案子
I happen to be familiar with your son's case.

154
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,530
我知道为了重审该案
And I understand that in order to reopen it,

155
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,340
罗斯先生冒了将他的刑期增加到无期的风险
Mr. Ross risked increasing his sentence to life.

156
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,800
是这样的
That's correct.

157
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,570
我想知道如果他赌输了
Well, I'd like to know how you'd have felt

158
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,030
你会是什么感觉
if he lost that gamble.

159
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,480
我会彻底绝望
I'd have been devastated.

160
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,520
如果真的是那样  而你又发现
And if that happened, how would you have felt

161
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,630
罗斯先生根本就不是个律师
if you then found out 

162
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,570
那你又会是什么感觉
that Mr. Ross wasn't even a lawyer after all?

163
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,530
反对  法官大人
Objection, Your Honor,

164
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,200
她可以问多少假设性的问题
how many hypotheticals can she ask?

165
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,260
没关系
That's okay.

166
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,230
我觉得这里的每个人都知道
I think everybody in this courtroom knows

167
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,590
那会是什么感觉
how they would feel.

168
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,090
我没有问题了  法官大人
No more questions, Your Honor.

169
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,480
我根本不会在乎那张纸
I wouldn't have cared what a piece of paper had to say,

170
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,980
因为罗斯先生是我唯一碰到
because Mr. Ross is the only lawyer I ever ran into

171
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,600
愿意帮我儿子的律师
that ever gave a damn about my son.

172
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,180
罗斯先生  你还要传唤第二位证人吗
Mr. Ross, would you care to call your next witness?

173
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,450
我想不到比这位
I can't imagine anyone

174
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,170
更适合的证人了  法官大人
being more eloquent than that, Your Honor.

175
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,510
辩方没有证人了
Defense rests.

176
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,990
{\an8}诉讼双雄
第五季第十五集

177
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,900
在发愁结案陈词吗
Having trouble with your closing?

178
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,440
没有  只是正常的步骤而已
No, it's just part of the process.

179
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,230
如果我跟你说今天看到你
Would it make you feel better if I told you

180
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,370
在庭上的表现让我感到前所未有的自豪
that I have never felt more proud of my future husband

181
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,620
这会让你好受点吗
than I did watching you up there today?

182
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,740
会的
Yes, it would.

183
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,030
那就好
Good.

184
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,440
因为我想跟你谈谈你的结案陈词
Because I want to talk to you about your closing.

185
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,940
别跟我说你想让陪审团裁定法律无效
Don't tell me you want me to go with jury nullification.

186
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,630
让陪审团同情你
There is nothing wrong with getting a jury

187
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,580
并没有什么错
to sympathize with you, 

188
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,880
迈克  你的父母死于车祸
and, Mike, your parents died in a car accident.

189
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,590
每个人都会同情你的
Who isn't gonna feel for a person like that?

190
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,200
瑞秋  这么做的唯一问题是
Rachel, the only problem with me saying,

191
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,010
"放过我吧因为我童年不幸"这种话
"Let me off because tragedy struck me as a child"

192
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,430
基本等于我承认了自己有罪
is I've pretty much admitted that I'm guilty.

193
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,760
不  区别在于  那场车祸正是
No, the difference is that that accident is the reason

194
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,980
你想要成为一名律师的原因
that you wanted to become a lawyer in the first place.

195
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,210
他们不仅会谅解你  也会因此喜欢你
And they won't just understand it, they will love you for it.

196
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,610
你怎么知道
How can you know that?

197
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,620
因为我就是这样
Because I love you for it.

198
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,890
跟他们讲你的故事
Tell them your story and I am telling you,

199
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,580
他们会放过你
they'll let you go.

200
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,530
路易  你找我
Louis, you wanted to see me?

201
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,650
那是几个小时前的事了
Yeah, that was hours ago.

202
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,590
我们得谈谈  现在就得谈
We need to talk. We need to talk right now.

203
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,950
-谈什么  -就谈迈克・罗斯
- About what? - About the fact that

204
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,810
突然开始为自己辩护这件事
Mike Ross is all of a sudden representing himself.

205
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,580
这有什么好谈的
And why exactly do we need to talk about that?

206
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,830
因为这就意味着哈维认为自己要输了
Because it means Harvey thinks he's gonna lose.

207
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,270
这其中的逻辑关系是什么
You wanna walk me through that logic?

208
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,080
哈维这辈子都没有放弃过自己案子的掌控权
Harvey's never given up control of a case in his life,

209
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,920
如果他现在这么做了
and if he's doing that now,

210
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,670
说明他想把失败的记录留给迈克
it means he wants that loss on Mike's record.

211
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,860
路易  在这种时候
Louis, at a time like this,

212
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,690
哈维是不会在乎记录的
Harvey doesn't care about records.

213
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,190
胡扯  我反复读过庭审记录了
Bullshit. I read the transcript backwards and forwards. 

214
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,400
他肯定认为他要输了
He thinks he's gonna lose.

215
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,880
路易  到底发生了什么事
Louis, what's really going on here?

216
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,170
我告诉你发生了什么
I'll tell you what's going on.

217
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,760
如果哈维认为我们会输
If Harvey thinks we're gonna lose,

218
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,330
那我们一定会输  如果那样的话
then we'll lose, and if that happens,

219
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,290
你也知道吉布斯下一个目标会是谁
you know who Gibbs is coming after next.

220
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,790
路易  如果真到了那个时候我们再想办法
Louis, we will deal with that when and if she does,

221
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,610
但我告诉你
but I am telling you,

222
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,330
哈维让迈克掌控大局并不是他放弃了
Harvey letting Mike take the reins is not him giving up.

223
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,380
而是他成长了
It's him growing up

224
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,640
并且意识到这个胜利不该由他摘取
and realizing he is not the one to bring this home.

225
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,280
你想聊聊吗
Do you want to talk about it?

226
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
聊什么
Talk about what?

227
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,090
我说不好  没准可以聊聊
Oh, I don't know, maybe the fact

228
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,980
迈克正在准备一个可以让他
that Mike is working on a closing

229
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,520
免除牢狱之灾的结案陈词
to keep himself out of jail

230
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,380
而你却没有在帮他
and you're not working on it with him.

231
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,000
我没什么可帮得了  唐娜
There's nothing for me to do, Donna.

232
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,970
这件事交给他了
It's in his hands.

233
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,340
交给他
In his hands?

234
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,100
哈维  那是个庭审策略
Harvey, that was a trial maneuver.

235
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,950
但并不意味着你不能在他需要时帮助他
It doesn't mean you can't help him when he needs you.

236
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,660
-他不需要我  -他这个时候最需要你
- He doesn't need me. - He needs you more than ever.

237
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,070
不  他不需要  是时候让他
No, he doesn't, and it's time for him

238
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,940
脱离二线真正参与进来了
to put the clipboard down and get in the game.

239
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,760
-哈维  -唐娜  这事不仅是
- Harvey-- - Donna, this wasn't just

240
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,790
把证词塞进结案陈词这么简单
some move to slip testimony in.

241
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,550
这关系到迈克的人生
This is Mike's life.

242
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,880
那是他的故事  必须要他自己来讲
It's his story and he needs to be the one to tell it.

243
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,130
至今为止他做的每件事都是在为这一刻做准备
Everything he's done up until now has prepared him for this,

244
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,410
而且我可以很肯定的说
and I'm telling you,

245
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,840
他准备好了
he's ready for it.

246
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,600
辩方准备好做结案陈词了吗
Is defense ready for closing statements?

247
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,090
迈克
Mike?

248
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,090
你还好吗
You okay?

249
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,800
罗斯先生
Mr. Ross?

250
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,980
是的  法官大人
Oh, uh, yes, Your Honor.

251
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,130
陪审团的各位女士们  先生们
Um, ladies and gentleman of the jury,

252
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,940
我想我们
I think most of us...

253
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,280
你们中的大多数在早前的庭审中都听说了
You guys heard evidence earlier in the trial

254
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,060
我可以过目不忘
that I have a photographic memory,

255
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,470
确实如此  但在具体操作中
and I do, but the way it works--

256
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,930
我并不是将我所看到的所有东西都记住
I don't just take a snapshot of something.

257
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,270
而是我要先阅读
See, I read it

258
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,810
然后理解它
and then I understand it,

259
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,590
一旦我理解了
and once I understand it,

260
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,030
我就不会忘记
then I never forget it,

261
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,470
我试图记住我的陈述词
but I've been trying to memorize my speech,

262
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,590
但我记不住
but I can't

263
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,700
因为这都是胡扯
because it's bullshit,

264
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,930
因为我
because I...

265
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,040
我简直一团糟
I am bullshit.

266
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,220
事实上  我确实是个骗子
You see, the truth is--is that I am guilty of being a fraud.

267
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,520
我这辈子都想要成为一个律师
My whole life I have wanted to be a lawyer

268
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,950
然后去帮助那些像克利福德・丹纳一样的人
so that I could help people like Clifford Danner.

269
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,580
那些无从获得支持的人
People who have no one else to fight for them.

270
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,590
那些不被信任的人
No one who believes in them,

271
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,010
但与此同时  我作为律师所做的事
but instead, all I've done as a lawyer

272
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,500
只是日夜不停的工作
is work night and day

273
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,990
好让那些富有的人获得更多财富
to put money into the hands of rich people.

274
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,610
我被赋予了一种天赋  但我却浪费了它
I was given a gift and I wasted it,

275
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,990
我为自己感到羞耻
and I'm ashamed of myself.

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,070
同时我还不知收敛
And--and as a final insult,

277
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,990
将这位悲伤地女士拖到众人面前
I paraded this mourning woman out in front of you

278
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,270
只是为了让你们喜欢我
just as a way to get you to admire me.

279
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,830
我很抱歉  格洛丽亚
I am so sorry, Gloria.

280
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,640
我能承诺的
And all I can say 

281
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,650
只有无论这些人
is that I promise you,

282
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,580
裁定我有罪与否
whether these people find me innocent or not,

283
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,720
我都会将我的余生
I am gonna spend the rest of my life

284
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,390
致力于为世界上所有的克利福德・丹纳而战
fighting for the Clifford Danners of this world.

285
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,480
我不会再浪费我的天赋了
I will not waste that gift again.

286
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,640
不管你们相不相信
You could believe it or not,

287
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,600
但我是个律师
but I am a lawyer,

288
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,410
而且我会一直做下去
and I always will be.

289
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,270
谢谢
Thank you.

290
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,060
这真是件有趣的事情
Well, it's an interesting thing, really,

291
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,110
看着罪犯们是如何玩弄我们的感情的
how criminals can play with our emotions.

292
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,210
迈克・罗斯能说会道
Mike Ross is articulate

293
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,150
很有煽动力  也很有激情
and persuasive and passionate

294
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,780
听着他的总结陈词
and listening to his closing argument,

295
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,300
我自己差点都想放他一马了
I almost want to let him go myself,

296
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,310
唯独有一个问题  他是个骗子
except for one thing: he's a liar.

297
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,840
他并没有一周一次往返于哈佛
He didn't commute to Harvard one day a week

298
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,240
却可笑地声称自己那么做了
as he so laughably claims.

299
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,390
他没上过大学
He didn't go to college.

300
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,290
没有任何纸质文件能证明他被录取
There is no paper record of his enrollment,

301
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,400
也没有他申请法学院的文件
no applications to law school,

302
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,340
年册里没有他的照片
no picture in the yearbook,

303
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,890
也没有他的班级排名
no class rankings,

304
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,980
甚至没有一个人记得他
no one at all who even remembers him.

305
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,630
除了他那个负债累累的朋友
Except for that one indebted friend

306
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,610
满嘴跑火车
with a lot to lose,

307
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,370
假如你们相信他的证词的话
and if you believe his testimony,

308
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,440
我这还有一堆谎言可以说给你们听
I got a bridge over Brooklyn I'd like to sell you.

309
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,270
不管他承不承认
And whether he says it or not,

310
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,150
他就是指望着
he's banking on the fact

311
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,800
你们将这事看作是一起无受害人犯罪
that you are gonna think this is a victimless crime,

312
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,740
但假如你们宣告他无罪
but if you acquit him,

313
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,630
你们就是允许大家说
you are giving permission to everyone to say

314
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,920
"嘿  我要去装成一个律师"
"hey, I'm gonna pretend to be a lawyer."

315
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,020
"我想说自己是个医生"
"I think I'm gonna say I'm a doctor."

316
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,970
"你猜怎么着
"Hell, you know what?

317
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,090
今天我要装成一名飞行员"
Today, I'm gonna pose as a pilot."

318
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,810
想象一下有一天你在手术台上醒来
Imagine if one day you woke up on the operating table

319
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,000
却发现那个要划开你的胸腔的人
to discover the man who was about to crack open your chest

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,480
不是个真正的医生
is not really a doctor.

321
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,080
有罪
Guilty.

322
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,650
有罪
Guilty.

323
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,680
有罪
Guilty.

324
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,570
你们可得弄清楚
Make no mistake about it,

325
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,550
迈克・罗斯觉得自己比你们厉害
Mike Ross thinks he's better than you.

326
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,800
他觉得自己不用和你们遵守一样的规矩
He thinks he doesn't have to play by the same rules,

327
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,280
但我们知道他是要的
but we know he does.

328
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,430
因为  陪审团的女士们和先生们
Because, ladies and gentleman of the jury,

329
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,960
迈克・罗斯...
Mike Ross...

330
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,440
是个骗子
is a fraud.

331
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,470
迈克...
Mike...

332
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,240
迈克...
Mike...

333
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,630
迈克
Mike.

334
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,210
她很厉害  哈维
She was good, Harvey.

335
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,080
-没错  但你也是啊  -你做得很好
- Yeah, so were you. - You were great.

336
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,370
她更厉害  她所说的一切都是真的
She was better. Everything she said was true

337
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,910
而陪审团也知道这一点
and the jury knows it.

338
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,000
不  他们不知道
No they don't.

339
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,140
听着  从我遇见你的那天起
Look, ever since the day I met you,

340
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,100
你就一直能看见人性中的闪光点
you have always seen the good in people,

341
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,300
而我们只需要陪审团中有一个人
and we only need one person on the jury

342
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,590
能感受到你的闪光点
to feel that way about you.

343
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,180
-假如他们感受不到呢  -无所谓
- And what if they don't? - It doesn't matter.

344
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,830
因为无论如何我们也无法改变局面了
Because we can't do anything about it anyways.

345
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,010
所以我们出去吧
So, let's get out of here.

346
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,910
-我不能  -什么叫你不能
- I can't. - What do you mean you can't?

347
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,610
我是说  在陪审团回来前我不能离开
I mean, I can't leave until that jury comes back.

348
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,280
迈克  他们也许几天都回不来
Mike, they might not come back for days.

349
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,160
我不知道该怎么和你说  哈维
I don't know what to tell you, Harvey,

350
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,460
但我不能离开这里
but I can't leave here.

351
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,880
没关系的  哈维
It's okay, Harvey.

352
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,170
听着
Look,

353
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,110
迈克  假如我们真的没时间了
Mike, if we really don't have time,

354
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,700
我不想把时间浪费在这里
I don't want to waste it here.

355
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,990
瑞秋  假如我离开了
Rachel, if I leave,

356
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,090
我满脑子只会想着
all I'm gonna be thinking about

357
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,800
仲裁室里发生了什么
is what's happening in that jury room.

358
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,560
那我去给我俩弄点吃的来
Then I am going to go and get us some food

359
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,220
然后我们一起吃点东西
and we're gonna have a bite to eat

360
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,700
因为我不会白白浪费这段时间的
because I'm not gonna let this time go to waste.

361
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,250
好吧
Okay.

362
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,230
-怎么了  -什么怎么了
- What? - What do you mean what?

363
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,720
我想知道你的想法
I want to know what you think.

364
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,540
我觉得一场重量级比赛
I think I saw a heavyweight fight

365
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,370
马上就要见分晓了
that's gonna come down to the goddamn cards.

366
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,400
你有不同的看法吗
You see it any different?

367
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,400
我的看法是我的命运掌握在了陪审团手里
What I see is my fate in the hands of a jury,

368
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,900
而我不喜欢这样
and I don't like it.

369
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,980
不然你以为我为何
Why the hell do you think

370
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,940
大部分时间都选择和解而不愿上庭
I cut so many deals instead of going to trial?

371
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,000
吉布斯唯一会接受的和解协议
Well, the only deal that Gibbs is going to cut

372
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,790
就是把我们整死
is the one that hangs us out to dry.

373
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,160
我不知道你怎么想
And I don't know about you,

374
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,030
但我可不喜欢就这样坐在一旁
but I don't feel like just sitting by

375
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,610
等着这件事出结果
while this thing goes to verdict.

376
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,060
你以为我喜欢吗
You think I do?

377
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,650
听着  没有其他办...
Look, there's no other w--

378
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,160
等等
Hold on a second.

379
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,610
我们可以把这弄成是无效审判
We could go get us a mistrial.

380
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,930
那样有什么好处
What good would that do?

381
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,470
无效审判不过是缓兵之计
A mistrial's just gonna kick the can down the road

382
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,880
直到迈克再次被审
till Mike gets tried again.

383
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,780
听我说
Listen to me.

384
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,330
在迈克想要代理自己时
when Mike wanted to represent himself,

385
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,700
吉布斯跳起来
Gibbs jumped out of her chair

386
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,640
说我们是在试图把这弄成无效审判
saying that we were trying to get a mistrial.

387
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,250
然后她要求我们放弃申请无效审判的权利
Then she demanded we waive our rights to one completely.

388
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,980
而她之所以这么做
And the only reason she'd do that

389
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,770
是因为她没有权利
is because she doesn't have authorization

390
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,090
再办一次这个案子
to try this case again.

391
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,080
这意味着
Which means,

392
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,520
无效审判不仅仅是缓兵之计
a mistrial isn't just kicking the can down the road.

393
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,310
的确  这可是毁灭性武器
No, it's blowing it to kingdom come.

394
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,480
唯一的问题是
The only problem is,

395
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,220
我们没有理由促成无效审判
we don't have grounds for a mistrial.

396
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,140
那你就最好出去找一些理由
Well, then you better go out and find some.

397
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,430
而且你最好在陪审团回来前就找到
And you better do it before that jury comes back.

398
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,510
我想跟你说的就是这个
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

399
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,660
我的律师不在场
My lawyer's not here.

400
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,010
那可不是我的问题
That's not my problem.

401
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,100
那为什么他告诉我
Then why did he tell me that

402
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,430
假如我和你说他来不了
if I told you he couldn't make it,

403
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,450
你就会让我延期之类的
you'd give me a continuance or something?

404
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,270
我告诉你我会怎么做  迪亚兹先生
I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Diaz.

405
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,610
既然珀金斯不在这里
Since Perkins isn't here,

406
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,780
我来帮帮你好了
I'll help you out.

407
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,310
与其上庭  然后
Instead of going to trial and winding up

408
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,490
判一个五年徒刑
with a five year sentence,

409
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,940
我当场就能让你减到三年半
I'll let you cop to three and a half right here.

410
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,290
五年
Five years?

411
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,010
我们只是偷了几台电视
We stole some TVs.

412
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,930
连犯三次  就是五年
For the third time, and that's five years.

413
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,420
我只是给他们开车的
I was only driving the car, man.

414
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,430
那你可以自己开车去监狱了
Then you can drive yourself to prison, man,

415
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,940
但我不会同意延期审理的
but I'm not giving you a continuance.

416
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,280
抱歉打断
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt,

417
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,710
但延不延期他说了不算  法官说了才算
but he doesn't give you a continuance, the judge does.

418
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,160
而且你可以自动获得延期
And you're entitled to one automatically

419
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,960
如果这是你的律师第一次没有出现
if this is the first time your attorney didn't show.

420
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,260
-你是什么人  -不关你的事
- And who the hell are you? - That's not your concern.

421
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,470
这也不关你的事
And this is not your concern.

422
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,910
我正把它变成我的事
Yeah, well, I'm making it my concern

423
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,270
因为我不愿意看着检察官
since I don't like watching prosecutors

424
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,330
欺骗没有律师的被告人
take advantage of unrepresented defendants.

425
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,910
我不过是向他提出了一个协议
All I'm doing is offering the man a deal.

426
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,760
-没有骗他  -胡说八道
- I'm not taking advantage. - That is bullshit.

427
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,480
你明知他的律师没让他
You know full well his lawyer didn't tell him

428
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,890
向你申请延期
to ask you for a continuance.

429
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,610
而是让他向法官申请
He told him to ask the judge for one.

430
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,640
你却想诓骗他三年半的牢狱之灾
Now you're gonna try and bully him into three and a half years

431
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,950
就为了一起在我听来算是轻微的盗窃罪
for what sounds to me like a simple misdemeanor theft.

432
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,970
你根本不了解这个案子
You don't know shit about this case.

433
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,950
我就要了解了  把相关文件给我
Well, I'm about to. Hand over the case file.

434
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,160
我什么都不会给的
I don't have to give you anything.

435
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,510
你又不是他的律师
You're not his attorney.

436
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
迪亚兹先生  我叫迈克・罗斯
Mr. Diaz, my name is Mike Ross.

437
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,860
你是愿意让我为你辩护
Now, do you want me to represent you

438
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,570
还是仍想让那个连你的听证会都不来的混蛋
or do you want to stick with this asshole Perkins

439
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,050
珀金斯继续为你辩护
who didn't even show up to your hearing?

440
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,840
他是我的律师
He's my lawyer.

441
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,470
唐娜  你得马上帮我个忙
Donna, I need your help and I need it right now.

442
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,660
怎么了  陪审团回来了吗
What's going on? Is the jury back?

443
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,980
没  我需要知道斯特芬尼・利斯顿是否还在
No, I need to know if Stephanie Liston still works

444
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,190
-联邦检察官办公室工作  -在  怎么了
- at the U.S. Attorney's office. - She does, why?

445
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,720
我需要陪审团名单
I need the names of the jurors.

446
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,210
哈维  如果你在考虑干扰...
Harvey, if you're even thinking about tampering--

447
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,530
不  我没想干扰陪审团
No, I'm not thinking of tampering with the jury.

448
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,370
我只是得找出申请裁决无效的理由
I just need to find grounds for a mistrial.

449
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,400
裁决无效
A mistrial?

450
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,600
你告诉迈克他成功了是骗他的吗
You told Mike he killed it. Was that a lie?

451
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,030
-不是  -那你为什么
- No, it wasn't. - Then why are you

452
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,030
-突然又犹疑了  -这叫以防万一
- so suddenly having doubts? - It's called hedging.

453
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,460
不  这叫违法行为
No, it is called breaking the law

454
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,530
我不想参与
and I don't want any part of it.

455
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,150
见鬼  唐娜  我是在保护迈克
Goddamn it, Donna. I'm trying to protect Mike.

456
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,340
那你应该合法地申请判决无效
Then maybe you should be getting a mistrial legally

457
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,050
而不是让我去做你要求的事
instead of having me do what you're asking.

458
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,920
-我们没时间了  -我不管
- We don't have time. - I don't care!

459
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,280
你这是怎么了
What the hell's wrong with you?

460
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,440
-我  -对  你
- Me? - Yes, you.

461
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,390
你到底站哪边儿
Whose side are you on?

462
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,140
你居然怀疑我
Oh, don't you dare ask me that.

463
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,920
你明知我会为了你和迈克去犯法
You know damn well that I would break the law for you and Mike,

464
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,170
但你却让我
but you are asking me

465
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,400
去让我的朋友犯法
to have my friend do it,

466
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,050
-我不会这么做的  -唐娜
- and I am not going to. - Donna--

467
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,760
哈维  就算我去找斯特芬尼
Harvey, even if I did ask Stephanie

468
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,830
而且她答应了  但这不可能
and she said yes, which she never would,

469
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,700
你就又把无辜的人
you would have to drag innocent people

470
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,340
牵扯进这个烂摊子了
through the mud to get this done.

471
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,230
我认识的那个哈维
And the Harvey I know

472
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,890
可不是这种人
isn't that kind of person.

473
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,530
唐娜  出什么事了
Donna, what is going on?

474
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,560
-你怎么不高兴  -我没不高兴
- Why are you so upset? - I'm not upset.

475
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,210
你说"我没不高兴"的时候
When you say, "I'm not upset,"

476
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,890
是你演出来的吗  因为烂透了
is that you acting? Because it sucks.

477
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,510
你有事吗  路易
What do you want from me, Louis?

478
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,510
我只想让你少废话  告诉我出了什么事
I want you to cut the bullshit and tell me what's wrong.

479
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,790
我看见你离开哈维的办公室
I just saw you leave Harvey's office

480
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,780
五秒钟以后  他也走了
and five seconds later, I saw him do the same thing.

481
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,850
路易  事情就是哈维希望我
Okay, Louis, what's wrong is Harvey wants me

482
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,370
从我在联邦检察官办公室的朋友那里
to get the names of the jurors from my friend

483
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,670
弄到陪审团名单
in the U.S. Attorney's office.

484
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,710
-他想干扰陪审员吗  -他想争取裁决无效
- He's trying to tamper? - He's trying to get a mistrial.

485
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,460
那你为什么不帮他
Well, then why the hell aren't you helping him do it?

486
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,690
-什么  -你没听错
- What? - You heard me.

487
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,480
你为什么不竭尽所能帮他
Why aren't you doing whatever you can do help him?

488
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,890
难以置信你居然对我说这种话
I can't believe you just said that to me.

489
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,680
唐娜  听我说  如果哈维这么做
Donna, listen to me, if Harvey's doing this,

490
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,630
说明他觉得自己要输了
it means he thinks he's going to lose.

491
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,950
如果他觉得自己要输
And if he thinks he's gonna lose,

492
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,180
就说明他一定会输
it means he is gonna lose.

493
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,420
如果迈克被定罪
And if Mike goes down,

494
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,960
所有人都得给他陪葬
everybody goes down with him.

495
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,280
你就一点都不在乎吗
Don't you care about that at all?

496
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,840
我真有点受够了被人问
I'm getting a little tired of people asking me

497
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,540
我在不在乎  因为我在乎
whether I care or not. Because I do,

498
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,470
但还没在乎到为了保自己
But not enough to push women and children aside

499
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,760
就拉无辜的人下水
to get on a lifeboat.

500
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,730
如果你找我就是为了这个
So, if that's all you came in here to ask me,

501
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,180
别费口舌赶紧走吧
why don't you be on your way?

502
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,240
我买了些面包
Okay, I got us some bread,

503
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,990
奶酪  一点红酒和一张野餐垫
cheese, a little bit of wine, and a picnic blanket.

504
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,120
我们可以去外面...
So, I feel like we should just go outside--

505
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,010
-我去不了  -什么叫去不了
- I can't. - What do you mean you can't?

506
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,090
陪审团回来了吗
Did the jury come back?

507
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,160
没有  我遇见一个被告
No, I, uh, I met a defendant.

508
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,390
因为小偷小摸被抓了
He got caught in the act of some petty larceny,

509
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,810
他们想逼他认罪  所以我...
and, uh, they're trying to railroad him, so I--

510
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,240
所以你就接了这个案子
So, you're taking a case?

511
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,660
瑞秋  他只是想偷偷地
Rachel, he tried to sell a couple of TVs

512
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,930
卖几台电视  现在却面临五年的徒刑
out of the back of a truck. Now he's facing five years.

513
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,530
这栋楼里某个地方  正有12个人
And somewhere in this building there are 12 people

514
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,120
决定着你是不是个骗子
deciding whether or not you're a fraud

515
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,420
而你却坐在这里做着
and you're sitting here doing the exact thing

516
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,760
他们指控你的事
that they're accusing you of.

517
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,880
他们就在我眼前
They were right in front of me.

518
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,070
他的律师没来
His lawyer didn't show up--

519
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,000
-你是怎么了  -瑞秋
- What is wrong with you? - Whoa, Rachel, hey--

520
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,280
你不知道我害怕吗
Don't you understand that I am scared,

521
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,520
我还努力支持你
and that I am trying to be supportive

522
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,910
强装着勇敢
and to keep a brave face,

523
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,830
尽管我可能会失去你  迈克
but that I could lose you, Mike?

524
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,600
我理解你想待在这里
So, I understand you wanting to be here,

525
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,000
但我无法理解你不想陪着我
but I don't understand you not wanting to be with me.

526
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,370
过来
Come here.

527
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,150
我也害怕
Look, I'm scared too.

528
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,130
所以我才不能回家
That's why I can't go home.

529
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,500
我不知道我是如何卷进这场纷争  但是
And I don't know how I got into this, but...

530
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,820
我知道我必须这样做  瑞秋
I know that I need to do this, Rachel.

531
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,840
你对陪审团说的那些话都是认真的  对吗
You really meant what you said to the jury, didn't you?

532
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,870
没错
Yeah.

533
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,970
而且你说过你爱上我
And you said that you fell in love with me

534
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,610
是因为我想帮助别人
because of me wanting to help other people.

535
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,300
那这个人需要我的帮助
Well, this guy needs my help.

536
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,460
而且这或许是我最后一次可以这样做了
And it may be the last time I can do something like this.

537
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,820
那么  我们一起想办法帮助他
Well, then let's figure out a way to help him together.

538
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,850
午饭吃的什么  大卫
What's for lunch, David?

539
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,620
藜麦沙拉
Quinoa salad.

540
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,440
那好  慢慢享用
Well, enjoy it,

541
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,210
因为这将是你担任纽约市检察官的最后一顿饭
because it's gonna be your last meal as a U.S. Attorney.

542
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,640
迈克・罗斯答应过我
Mike Ross promised me

543
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,970
如果我给他那些通话记录
that if I gave him those phone records,

544
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,480
他不会对任何人讲
he wouldn't say anything to anyone.

545
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,440
我可不是迈克・罗斯
I'm not Mike Ross,

546
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,980
在我看来
and the way I see it,

547
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,510
我没有理由不把你肮脏的过去告诉给吉布斯
there's no reason for me not to tell Gibbs about your shady past

548
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,230
除非你给我一个理由
unless you give me a reason.

549
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,040
那我应该怎么办
And how am I supposed to do that?

550
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,530
打包起你的午饭
You pack up your lunch,

551
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,180
把它带到街边的那个法院咖啡馆
you take it down the street to the courthouse cafe,

552
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,650
当他们在两个小时后出来在那儿喝咖啡时
and you share a table with whatever juror shows up

553
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,000
你就和随便哪个陪审员坐在一起
when they break for coffee in about two hours.

554
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,030
这是干什么
What's this for?

555
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,240
拿去给随便哪个陪审员买一杯咖啡
For when you buy juror number whatever a cup of coffee.

556
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,550
老天啊  你想让我制造一场无效判决
Jesus christ, you want me to give you a mistrial?

557
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,030
这样做我可能会失去工作
I do that, I could lose my job.

558
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,260
但你不那样做  两小时后你会失去自由
You're gonna lose your freedom in two hours if you don't.

559
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,600
这是敲诈勒索
This is blackmail.

560
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,510
我说这叫赎罪
I call it atonement,

561
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,670
你将在今天接受应得的惩罚
and today's the day you face the music.

562
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,780
-你说得对  -关于什么
- You were right. - About what?

563
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,170
我真不应该为了达到目的
I shouldn't have been willing to hurt innocent people

564
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,910
而伤害一些无辜之人
to get done what I needed to get done.

565
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,250
好吧  但听上去你还是做了
Well, it sounds like you got it done anyway.

566
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,000
没错  只要凡妮莎拿到我需要的照片
I did, and you're gonna get a call from Vanessa

567
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,120
你就会接到她的电话
as soon as she gets me some pictures I need.

568
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,820
哈维  你刚才还在说你不应该
Harvey, you just said that you shouldn't have been willing

569
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,940
伤害无辜之人  
to hurt innocent people, and--

570
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,870
我没有伤害任何无辜之人  唐娜
I didn't hurt any innocent people, Donna.

571
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,130
我找了一个有罪之人
I found a guilty one.

572
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,340
那好  那我会告诉杰西卡
Well, then I will go tell Jessica

573
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,330
凡妮莎一打电话来我就告诉你
and I will let you know the second Vanessa calls.

574
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,230
唐娜
Donna.

575
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,950
什么  哈维
What, Harvey?

576
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
谢谢
Thanks.

577
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,560
真不敢相信我们找到了
I can't believe we found that.

578
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,920
真不敢相信你做到了
I can't believe you did.

579
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,470
瑞秋  我们可能可以用这个优势
Rachel, this might give us the leverage

580
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,440
确保迪亚兹根本不用坐牢
to make sure Diaz doesn't do any jail time at all.

581
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,410
-你真这样想吗  -没错
- Do you really think so? - Yeah, I do.

582
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,820
而且我一点不感到意外
And it doesn't surprise me

583
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,560
因为我同样觉得你会成为一名出色的律师
'cause I also think that you're gonna make a great lawyer.

584
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,040
那么  我们把时间花在这上面
Well, then spending our time doing this

585
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,000
也许并不是一个坏主意
wasn't such a bad idea after all.

586
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,600
迪亚兹先生  你准备好进行辩护了
Mr. Diaz, are you ready to enter a plea?

587
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,660
在辩护之前  法官大人  我想提交一份申请
Before we do, Your Honor, I'd like to enter a motion

588
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,930
撤销对迪亚兹先生的汽车的搜查
to invalidate the search of Mr. Diaz's vehicle.

589
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,560
-什么  -搜查令的取得
- What? - The warrant was obtained

590
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,320
全是因为我当事人和他表兄之间的一通电话
because of a phone call between my client and his cousin,

591
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,130
而且没有任何证据表明亚历山大先生
and there's no evidence that Mr. Alexander

592
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,680
有权窃听那通电话
had authorization to tap that call.

593
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,750
法官大人  我们有其他证据支撑搜查令
Your Honor, we had other sources for our search warrant.

594
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,130
-那到底是什么  -亚历山大先生
- And what exactly were they? - Mr. Alexander?

595
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,430
反对  法官大人
Objection, Your Honor.

596
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,110
吉布斯女士  这个案子
Ms. Gibbs, this case isn't

597
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,410
并不在司法部的管辖内
under the Justice Department's jurisdiction,

598
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,850
那么  你到底在反对什么呢
so, what exactly are you objecting to?

599
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,330
我反对的是这个人根本不是律师
I'm objecting to the fact that this man is not a lawyer.

600
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,480
法官大人  那是谎言
Your Honor, that is a lie.

601
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,650
现在  陪审团正在对他进行定罪
And as we speak, a jury is finding him guilty.

602
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,540
在他们定罪之前  我的律师证编号有效
And until they do, my bar number is active.

603
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,790
这太荒唐了  法官大人
This is ridiculous, Your Honor.

604
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,820
他这是在愚弄整个法庭
He is making a mockery of this entire courtroom,

605
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,300
{\an8}奈特法官

606
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,290
我强烈要求在对他的审讯结果出来以前
and I urge you to at least delay this case

607
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,680
你至少应该延迟审理本案
until his jury comes back.

608
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,710
法官大人  我之所以要为迪亚兹先生辩护
Your Honor, the only reason I'm representing Mr. Diaz,

609
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,700
是因为法院指派的律师没有出现
is because his court-appointed lawyer didn't show up,

610
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,470
然后那个人企图迫使他仓促地
and then that man attempted to railroad him

611
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,910
签订一份离谱的认罪协议
into an outrageous plea deal.

612
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,710
吉布斯女士  他在你的审理中可能是名骗子
Ms. Gibbs, he may be a fraud in your court,

613
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,290
但是既然他还没有被认定任何罪名
but since he hasn't been convicted of anything,

614
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,750
他在我的法庭内就是一名律师
he isn't one in mine.

615
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,200
除非亚历山大在此能够出示证据
And unless Mr. Alexander here magically finds his voice,

616
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,480
批准通过罗斯先生
Mr. Ross's motion

617
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,470
申请排除对他当事人的汽车搜查证据的动议
to exclude the search of his clients vehicle passes.

618
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,590
那个女人说的是真话吗
Is it true what that woman was saying?

619
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,680
没错  他们正在审查要不要毁掉他的人生
Yes, they're deliberating on his fate right now.

620
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,170
我才不关心他们在审查什么
I don't give a shit if they're deliberating.

621
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,540
他到底是不是假冒的
Is he a fake or not?

622
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,660
你亲眼看到了  他正要为你达成协议
You saw what he just did, and he's about to cut you a deal

623
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,820
或许让你的牢狱之灾从四年变成几个月
from four years behind bars to maybe a few months.

624
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,870
那么你认为呢
So what do you think?

625
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,410
他说什么了
What'd he say?

626
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,010
他现在太生气没办法达成协议
He's too pissed off to make a deal right now,

627
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,920
但相信我  他会冷静下来  然后达成协议
but trust me, he'll calm down, and then he will.

628
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,970
迈克  你要去哪儿
Mike, where are you going?

629
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,690
我要试着为我自己达成协议
I'm gonna go try and make a deal of my own.

630
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,540
你走得太快
You ran out of there so fast

631
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,080
我都没机会和你说话
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.

632
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,260
你到底想干吗  罗斯先生
What exactly do you want, Mr. Ross?

633
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,110
我想跟你签个协议
I want to make a deal.

634
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,760
你终于准备好出卖斯佩克特先生了
You finally ready to turn on Mr. Specter?

635
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,150
不  但我愿意承认有罪
Nope, but I am ready to plead guilty

636
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,650
而且永不做律师
and never practice law again

637
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,900
只要你答应
if you agree

638
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,430
不再对付任何皮尔森-斯佩克特的合伙人
to not go after any of the partners at Person Specter.

639
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,170
在我第一次遇见他的时候
That's the same bullshit your boss said to me

640
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,360
你老板也说过这句废话
when I first met him.

641
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,630
你不做律师了
You're done practicing,

642
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,410
我就应该让你全身而退吗
so I should just let you get away with it?

643
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,650
既然我那时没有听他的话
Why would I listen to you now

644
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,400
为何现在要听你的呢
if I didn't listen to him then?

645
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,660
因为你都写在了脸上
Because you've got it written all over your face.

646
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,530
看见我做律师让你恶心
Seeing me be a lawyer makes you sick.

647
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,210
对吗  如果我赢了
Right? And if I win,

648
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,430
我会继续当律师
I'm gonna keep being a lawyer,

649
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,390
那样会让你一辈子都恶心
and it's gonna make you sick for the rest of your life.

650
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,310
不行  理由不够充分
No deal. It's not a good enough reason.

651
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,370
行  那试试这个
Okay, then let's try this one.

652
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,090
你在联邦检察官办公室很长时间
You've been at the same level at the U.S. Attorney's office

653
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,250
没升职了
for a long time.

654
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,630
起诉一个公认的骗子
Now, a person who can't get a conviction

655
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,850
还没法给他定罪的检察官
against a man that everyone thinks is a fraud,

656
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,000
就走投无路了
well, that's a person who's going nowhere.

657
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,960
这是你挽回颜面的机会
This is a chance for you to save face.

658
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,330
我不需要挽回颜面
I don't need to save face

659
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,940
因为他们会判你有罪
because they're gonna find you guilty.

660
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,270
你确定吗
Are you sure about that?

661
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,190
你连说服一个法官让我离席都做不到
'cause you couldn't convince one judge to make me stand down,

662
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,840
凭什么觉得自己能说服十二个陪审员呢
so what makes you think you're gonna convince 12 jurors?

663
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,060
你要知道  迈克
You know what, Mike?

664
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,320
事实是
The truth is,

665
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,940
你本可以成为好律师的
you would have made a good lawyer,

666
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,670
但你并不是
but you're not one,

667
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,650
我会把你送进监狱
and I'm gonna put you away.

668
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,640
有什么事  唐娜
What can I do for you, Donna?

669
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,860
哈维让我告诉你
Harvey wanted me to let you know that 

670
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,950
只要接下来几个小时没有判决
as long as they don't reach a verdict in the next few hours,

671
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,030
-你这个案子就会成为无效判决  -无效判决
- you'll have a mistrial. - I'll have a mistrial?

672
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,620
-你在想什么  唐娜  -没什么
- What's on your mind, Donna? - Nothing.

673
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,330
大概就是我从没想到会看到有一天
I guess I just never thought I'd see the day

674
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,140
你认为哈维会输
when you thought Harvey was gonna lose.

675
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,860
谁说我觉得哈维会输
And who says I think Harvey's going to lose?

676
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,350
-无效判决啊  -不
- A mistrial says it. - No,

677
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,100
这只说明我不想在十二个陌生人身上冒险
it says I'm not willing to take a chance on 12 complete strangers.

678
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,600
这说明你对他没信心
It says you don't have faith in him.

679
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,060
唐娜  这话说得有点离谱
Donna, you don't know what you're saying.

680
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,590
是吗  我知道我不是名律师
Don't I? I know I'm not a lawyer,

681
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,080
但如果迈克无罪  当然不会对他
but isn't it true that if Mike gets found innocent,

682
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,070
进行再次审理吗  但如果判决无效
there's no double jeopardy, but if a mistrial happens,

683
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,890
他们未来可能还会查他
they might come after him again one day?

684
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,260
没错  唐娜
Yes, Donna, that is true,

685
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,640
但我和哈维都坚信那不会发生
but Harvey and I are banking that never happens.

686
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,590
-那如果发生了呢  -那我很遗憾
- And what if it does? - Then I'm sorry,

687
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,540
但事实是  是迈克・罗斯
but the truth is, Mike Ross is the reason

688
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,330
当初让我们陷入困境
why we're in this mess in the first place,

689
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,580
如果现在要在
and if it's a choice

690
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,790
我和他之间选一个以后能高枕无忧的人
between his peace of mind down the road and mine today,

691
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,570
我会选自己
I'm choosing mine.

692
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,940
还有事吗
Now, is that all?

693
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,780
路易・利特  真巧
Louis Litt, what a coincidence,

694
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,170
我刚准备给你办公室打电话  假装是你表亲
I was just about to call your office, say I was your cousin,

695
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,700
问你决定要不要接受我的提议
and ask if you'd decided to take me up on my offer.

696
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,320
我回答你之前  我想知道
Before I give you an answer, I want to know,

697
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,090
如果我能向你证实哈维清楚迈克的身份
if I give you proof that Harvey knew about Mike,

698
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,330
-你会给我豁免权吗  -要看情况
- will you give me immunity? - Well, that depends.

699
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,250
你有什么证据
What do you have?

700
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,400
什么叫我有什么证据
What do you mean, what do I have?

701
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,380
我就足够了
I have me.

702
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,070
这还不够充分
Well, that's not good enough.

703
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,590
那你到底找我干什么
Well, then what the hell did you come to me for?

704
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,830
因为我期待的不只是
Because I was expecting something more

705
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,620
想要自救之人的证词
than the testimony of a man who's saving his own ass,

706
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,110
那对我毫无用处
which gets me nothing.

707
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,720
毫无用处  我会给你证词
Nothing? I'd be giving you my word.

708
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,420
我不需要你的证词  我需要证据
And I don't need your word. I need proof.

709
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,050
该死  我没有证据
Well, goddamn it, I don't have any proof.

710
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,450
那你对我没有用处
Well, then you're no good to me.

711
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,210
我现在为了搞垮你和你合伙人
And now I'm in the position of having to work that much harder

712
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,930
我不得不更加努力工作
to get both you and your partners,

713
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,200
请见谅  我得继续工作了  路易
so, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to it, Louis.

714
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
唐娜  你马上开始准备
Donna, I need you to start prepping a motion

715
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,680
迈克申请裁判无效的动议
for Mike to ask for a mistrial,

716
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,690
这是我们明早要做的第一件事
And we're gonna need to do it first thing in the morning.

717
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,310
哈维  我觉得裁判不会无效
Harvey, I don't think there's gonna be a mistrial.

718
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,140
这话是什么意思
What the hell are you talking about?

719
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,970
我刚和凡妮莎通完电话
I just got off the phone with Vanessa.

720
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,970
大卫・格林没现身
David Green never showed.

721
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,720
不管什么事  路易
Whatever it is, Louis,

722
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,850
我都没空
I don't have the time.

723
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:13,840
你最好抽空
Well, you better find the time

724
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,830
因为安妮塔・吉布斯要跟我做交易
because Anita Gibbs just offered me a deal.

725
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,280
我觉得你会狠狠拒绝她
And I assume you told her to shove it up her ass.

726
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,960
没错  但我其实想问
I did, but what I really wanted to say was,

727
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,360
"在哪里签字"
"Where do I sign?"

728
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,790
你刚跟我说了什么
What the hell did you just say to me?

729
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,490
你有没有考虑过
Did you ever think for one second,

730
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,290
如果迈克被定罪会怎样
what's gonna happen if Mike gets convicted?

731
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,990
迈克不会被定罪
Mike is not gonna get convicted.

732
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,120
-你怎么这么确定  -因为我要申请
- How could you be so sure? - Because I'm gonna go get us

733
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,100
-该死的裁判无效  -那还不够
- a goddamn mistrial. - That's not good enough.

734
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,590
我想知道你打算怎么做
I want to know how you're gonna do that.

735
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,570
-与你无关  -与我有关
- None of your business. - It is my business.

736
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,020
如果你要违反更多法律
If you're gonna go and break some more laws

737
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,960
就像你当初雇那个骗子一样
like you did when you hired the fraud in the first place.

738
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,150
你到底想干什么  路易
What the hell do you want, Louis?

739
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,650
你想让我同意你去做交易码
You want me to give you permission to cut a deal?

740
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,940
我希望你去自首
I want you to give yourself up.

741
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,440
-你疯了吗  -我很清醒
- Are you out of your mind? - No, I am in my mind.

742
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,040
如果你申请不到无效裁判  判决反咬一口
You can't get a mistrial, that verdict comes back the wrong way,

743
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,960
整个律所的人都会因为你的所作所为
everyone in this entire firm goes to jail

744
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,290
进监狱
because of what you did.

745
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,330
-回家吧  路易  -不  不行
- Go home, Louis. - No, no, no,

746
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,370
我要你亲口说出来
I want you to say it.

747
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,870
你私自雇了一个骗子
You went out on your own, you hired a fraud,

748
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,000
整个律所为此付出代价
and this whole firm's paying for it.

749
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,570
-闭嘴吧  -只有你
- Shut the hell up. - You and you alone

750
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,620
要为接下来的灾难负责
are responsible for the carnage of what's to come.

751
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,380
-路易  -你说啊
- Louis-- - Just say it!

752
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,120
你听着  我或许雇了个骗子
You listen to me. I may have hired a fraud,

753
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,360
但你才是那个本有可能告发他
but you're the one who had the chance to turn him in

754
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,530
却利用他的秘密实现你一直以来的目的人
and you used his secret to get what you always wanted.

755
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,250
所以  别半夜十一点跑来这里
So, don't come here at the 11th hour

756
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,670
把账赖到我头上  这是你自作自受
trying to blame me for having to sleep in the bed that you made.

757
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,380
我不想进监狱  哈维
I don't want to go to prison, harvey.

758
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,160
那就别挡路  让我想办法
Then get out of my way, and let me do what I do.

759
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,610
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

760
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,140
跟你谈谈
I came to talk.

761
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,520
我不得不说
I gotta hand it to you,

762
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,740
你本可以做个好律师
you would have made a good lawyer,

763
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,860
但你比我认为的更出色
but you're even better than I gave you credit for.

764
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,040
我考虑了你说的
You got in my head.

765
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,350
你要接受我的提议吗
You came here to take my offer?

766
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,290
我是来给你我自己的提议
I came to make an offer of my own.

767
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,310
你说你想要给我机会挽回颜面
You said you were giving me a chance to save face,

768
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,530
但如果我让你免受惩罚
but I let you get off with no punishment.

769
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,060
就我的职业生涯来看
As far as my career goes,

770
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,680
那和你被判无罪也没什么区别
I might as well have let them find you innocent.

771
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,890
你想怎样
What do you want?

772
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,970
你认罪  坐两年牢
You plead guilty, do two years in prison,

773
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,540
我就放过你的朋友们
and I won't go after any of your friends.

774
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,070
我是不会因为我没犯过的罪
There's no way I agree to prison time

775
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,350
而去监狱坐牢的
for a crime I didn't commit.

776
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,730
我们现在不是在庭上  迈克
We're not in the courtroom right now, Mike,

777
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,950
所以废话少说
so let's cut the bullshit.

778
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,540
你我心知肚明你是犯了事的
We both know you did this.

779
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,180
如果你不想付出相应的代价
So if you don't want to pay,

780
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,820
那就接受我一开始的提议
then you take me up on my original offer.

781
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,900
根本不用坐牢
You do no time,

782
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,210
我要的回报也只是一个你们律所的命名合伙人
and all I need in return is one name partner at your firm.

783
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,420
但我也告诉你了那是不可能的
And I told you that's never gonna happen.

784
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,150
那你可能想跟你的未婚妻谈谈
Well, maybe you want to talk to your fiancé

785
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,880
因为她的表情表明
because the look on her face says

786
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,690
她情愿把他们扔给狼群
she'd rather throw one of them to the wolves

787
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,620
也不愿看你坐牢
then see you in prison.

788
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,640
所以决定权在你
So it's up to you.

789
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,700
你可以接受我两个提议中的任何一个
You take either one of my deals,

790
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,790
也可以去陪审团那里碰碰运气
or you take your chances with the jury.

791
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,210
但记住
Just remember,

792
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,620
时间不等人
tick tock.

793
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,140
哪里来"两个提议"
What did she mean, "Either deal"?

794
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,160
她针对我的提议又提了一个
She countered my offer.

795
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,270
-多久  -瑞秋
- How long? - Rachel--

796
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,000
你要走多久
How long would you have to be away for?

797
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,700
-两年  -不  迈克
- Two years. - No, Mike.

798
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,520
-不  不行  -你知道
- No, you can't. - Do you know

799
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,250
如果我被判有罪  要蹲多少年吗
how much time I'm facing if I'm found guilty?

800
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:14,890
你不会被判有罪的
You're not gonna be found guilty.

801
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,060
七年
Seven years.

802
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,590
你不会被判有罪的
You're not gonna be found guilty.

803
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:20,100
我看到你上庭的样子了  你很棒的
I saw you up there. You were amazing.

804
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,900
你还是当初我爱上的那个
You were that same empathetic, brilliant man

805
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,820
那个善解人意  才华横溢的男人
that I fell in love with.

806
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,900
没道理陪审团的人看不出来
There's no way the jury didn't see that.

807
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,840
瑞秋  陪审团又没爱上我
Rachel, the jury is not in love with me.

808
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,720
万一他们看着我时看到的是
What if all they saw when they looked at me

809
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,240
那个自第一天接下这工作
was the same fraud that I've been

810
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,630
就一直在欺骗众人的我呢
since the first day I took that job?

811
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,620
这就是你为什么在考虑去坐牢吗
Is that why you're thinking about going to prison?

812
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,930
因为什么  因为你想惩罚自己
Because what? You want to punish yourself

813
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,100
而坐牢是唯一能让你不再愧疚的办法吗
and that's your only way to stop feeling guilty?

814
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,070
是的  可能有部分这个原因吧
Yes, maybe that's a part of it.

815
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,120
是吗  但听着好像就是这个原因啊
Okay, well it sounds like it's all of it.

816
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,710
我只知道  这是唯一有把握的方法
All I know, is it's the only sure way

817
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,010
让事情归于平息  并且能保证
to put this to bed and make sure that

818
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,310
受损失的只有我一人
the only person who is hurt by it is me.

819
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,690
那我呢
What about me?

820
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,080
我也只是爱你啊
Because all I did was love you!

821
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,510
如果你答应了什么送你去坐牢的协议
And if you take some deal that sends you to prison--

822
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,940
瑞秋  我们能撑过去的
Rachel, we can survive this--

823
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,610
该死的  迈克  这事儿他们也有一份啊
Goddamn it, Mike, they were in on it too!

824
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,500
我不会出卖他们的
I'm not gonna rat them out.

825
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,230
我不是劝你出卖他们
And I'm not asking you to.

826
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,820
我只是希望你能对自己多点信心
I'm just asking you to have faith in yourself.

827
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,380
好  我会的
Okay, I will.

828
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,250
你去哪儿了
Where the hell were you?

829
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,330
你是说我没在那家咖啡馆吗
You mean why I wasn't at the cafe?

830
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,930
我只是得出结论
I was just coming to the conclusion

831
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,960
你还是收回你的威胁  拿回家擦屁股去吧
that you could take that threat and shove it up your ass.

832
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,540
你以为我是在唬你吗
You think I'm bluffing you?

833
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,650
我管你是不是在唬我
I don't give a shit whether you're bluffing or not.

834
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,040
想到让迈克・罗斯上庭我就恶心
It made me sick to let Mike Ross back into a court.

835
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,280
我不会再让这种事发生了
I'm not letting that happen again.

836
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,840
我觉得你好像没有理解我明早打给
I don't think you understand what's gonna happen to you

837
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,070
安妮塔・吉布斯后你的下场
when I call Anita Gibbs tomorrow morning.

838
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,580
你没犯过错吗
You never made a mistake?

839
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,130
你没做过让自己后悔的事吗
You never did something you regret?

840
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,240
不然你以为我现在费心补救什么
What do you think I'm trying to fix right now?

841
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,720
听着  如果你不帮我的话
Look, if you don't help me,

842
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,920
那么我可是一点都不会后悔
making sure you never practice law again

843
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,810
确保你以后都干不成律师
isn't gonna be on my list of regrets.

844
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,910
我听过好多人说
You know, I've heard a lot of people talk

845
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,460
哈维・斯佩克特的厉害  说他战无不胜
about the great Harvey Specter, completely unbeatable.

846
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,820
但就我看来
From what I'm seeing,

847
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,320
他不过是一个恶霸  利用他人弱点
you're just a bully who uses other people's fears

848
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,740
来得到自己想要的东西
to get what he wants.

849
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,970
只可惜  今晚你不会得逞了
Well, it's not gonna happen tonight,

850
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,110
因为迈克・罗斯就要进监狱了
because Mike Ross is about to go to prison

851
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,830
而我也不会阻止此事
and I'm not going to stop him.

852
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:14,960
哈维  这大半夜的
Harvey, it's the middle of the night.

853
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,080
-你来这儿干吗  -我得见你
- What are you doing here? - I had to see you.

854
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,470
我知道你说过我不能再这么做了
I know you said I couldn't do this anymore,

855
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,910
但我得跟你谈谈
but I need to talk to you.

856
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,260
-谈什么  -谈我要怎么做
- Talk about what? - About what I have to do.

857
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,190
你准备自首了  是不是
You're gonna turn yourself in, aren't you?

858
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,770
路易  陪审团没有回来
Louis, the jury didn't come back,

859
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,130
既然他们已经回家了
and since they went home,

860
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,520
我现在也要回家
I'm going home.

861
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,060
不管什么事  明天早上再说
So, whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait until tomorrow.

862
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,720
明天就太迟了
Tomorrow could be too late.

863
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,400
什么太迟了
Too late for what?

864
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,080
这都是他的错
This is all his fault.

865
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,220
不是你起的头
You didn't start it.

866
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,720
也不是我起的头
I didn't start it.

867
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,100
是他起的头
He started it.

868
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,230
我不会背着哈维
I'm not having this conversation

869
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,730
-跟你谈这件事的  -没关系
- behind Harvey's back. - That's okay.

870
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,400
我已经跟他说过了
I already had it to his face.

871
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,100
希望能让他做出正确的选择
Tried to get him to do the right thing

872
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,040
然后自首  但他不愿意
and turn himself in, but he wouldn't.

873
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,630
我不会劝他去自首的
I'm not going to convince him to do that.

874
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,170
我知道  因为他从来都不听劝
I know, because he'll never be convinced.

875
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,080
所以我们才要一起去找吉布斯
Which is why we need to go to Gibbs together--

876
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,750
-路易  -该死的  杰西卡
- Louis-- - Goddamn it, Jessica,

877
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,570
我们没时间了
we don't have any time!

878
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,030
你有没有想到过
Did it ever occur to you

879
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,860
如果迈克被判有罪
that if Mike gets found guilty,

880
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,380
哈维会做的第一件事
the first thing Harvey is going to do

881
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,500
就是走进那里  为我和你挡下这一切
is walk in there and take the bullet for me and you?

882
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,320
-我没想到过  -可我想到了
- No, it didn't. - Well, it occurred to me.

883
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,750
如果我们现在背叛他
We turn on him now,

884
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,760
那我们也没有比丹尼尔・哈德曼
we're not better than Daniel Hardman

885
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,610
或者查尔斯・傅滋曼
or Charles Forstman

886
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,280
或任何一个你鄙视的人好到哪里去
or any of those other people you despise.

887
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,390
你还没看出来吗
Don't you see?

888
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,340
我们是可以互相保护的
We could protect each other.

889
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,620
你不是希望我们互相保护  路易
You don't want us to protect each other, Louis.

890
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,120
你是希望有人告诉你
You want someone to tell you

891
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,160
你的想法没有问题
that what you're thinking is okay,

892
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,390
但我不会那么说的
and I'm not going to do that.

893
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,890
杰西卡  拜托了
Jessica, please.

894
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,460
晚安  路易
Good night, Louis.

895
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,060
你因为某个作弊者说你
So you want to turn yourself in

896
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,860
是个恶棍就想去自首吗
because some cheater called you a bully?

897
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,780
不  唐娜  我自首是因为
No, Donna, I want to turn myself in

898
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,060
他说的没错  我不是不可战胜的
because he was right. I'm not unbeatable.

899
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,320
不  哈维  我觉得是他让你觉得愧疚
No, Harvey, I think he made you feel guilty,

900
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,980
而你没法看清情况了
and now you're not seeing clearly.

901
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,000
-唐娜  -哈维  如果不是迈克而是别人受审
- Donna-- - Harvey, if it were anybody other than Mike on trial

902
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,500
而你看了他的结案陈词
and you saw his closing,

903
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,590
你觉得陪审团会给他定罪吗
do you think that the jury would convict him?

904
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,310
我不知道  唐娜  但我不能
I don't know, Donna, but I can't afford

905
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,700
承受出错的后果
to be wrong about this.

906
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,320
那我问你一句
Then let me as you a question:

907
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,610
你为什么不跟阿加德医生聊这事
why aren't you talking to dr. Agard about this?

908
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,200
-你怎么知道她的  -我就是知道
- How do you know about her? - Because I do.

909
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,740
我还知道你上次做重大决定时
And I also know that the last time you had

910
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,100
是去找了她  而不是我
a huge decision to make, you went to her and not me.

911
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,450
因为上次是公事
Because that was about business

912
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,000
-这次是私事  -不 哈维
- and this is personal. - No, Harvey,

913
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,810
你没去找她是因为你知道
you didn't go to her because you know she won't try

914
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,860
她不会试图劝阻你  但我会
to talk you out of this, but I will.

915
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,010
-唐娜  -别那么做
- Donna-- - Don't do it.

916
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,810
别再自愿承担后果了
Don't fall on your sword again.

917
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,540
-我必须...  -你不必
- I have to-- - No, you don't.

918
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,140
我们可能赢不了
We might not win.

919
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,840
你不需要永远都做英雄
You don't always have to be the hero.

920
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,530
我那么做不是为了当英雄
I'm not doing it to be the hero.

921
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,070
那你为了什么
Then why the hell are you doing it?

922
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,090
因为是我自己犯的错
Because it's my goddamn fault.

923
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,080
不  哈维  不是你的错
No, Harvey, it's not.

924
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,530
那是你和迈克两人的错
It's Mike's fault just as much as it is yours.

925
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,770
那为什么要我来将他推进火坑
Then why should I be the one to throw him under the bus?

926
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,290
你不明白吗  我不是要你
Don't you get it? I am not asking you

927
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,670
将他推进火坑
to throw him under the bus.

928
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,110
我是请求你
I am asking you

929
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,620
相信你们两人
to believe that the two of you

930
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,250
值得被判无罪
are worthy of being found innocent.

931
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,820
如果我做不到呢
And what if I can't do that?

932
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,630
那你可以等早上再去吉布斯办公室
Then you can march yourself down to Gibbs's office

933
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,570
把自己交出去
in the morning and turn yourself in.

934
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,720
但我不希望你那么做
But I don't want you to do that.

935
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,230
为什么
Why not?

936
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,790
因为我觉得你应该被判无罪
Because I think you're worthy.

937
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,040
我也不希望失去你
And I don't want to lose you.

938
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:44,780
哈维
Harvey,

939
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,710
明早去法院
go to the courthouse in the morning,

940
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,500
跟迈克一起坐下来  等判决出来
sit with Mike until that verdict comes in,

941
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,200
让他看到你对他有信心
and show him that you have faith in him.

942
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,200
就像我对你有信心一样
Like I have faith in you.

943
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,500
你好
Hello?

944
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,550
对  我是
Yeah, this is him.

945
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,670
好  我马上到
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there.

946
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,320
陪审团怎么这么快就出来了
How's the jury back so early?

947
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,850
不是陪审团
Oh, it's not the jury.

948
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,840
是迪亚兹案的检察官
It's the prosecutor from the Diaz case.

949
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,000
他想跟我聊聊
He wants to talk.

950
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,940
我或许雇了个骗子
I may have hired a fraud,

951
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,080
但你才是那个有机会告发他
but you're the one who had the chance to turn him in,

952
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,470
却你利用他的秘密实现你一直以来的目的人
and you used his secret to get what you always wanted...

953
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,680
-利特先生  -别半夜十一点来这里
- Mr. Litt... - so don't come in here--

954
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,280
很抱歉打扰你
I'm sorry to interrupt,

955
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,490
但你表妹格特鲁德打来电话了
but your cousin Gertrude's on the phone.

956
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,540
她说她需要确定
She said she needs to know

957
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,160
你找到她那盘旧混音带没
whether you found that old mixed tape of hers.

958
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,680
告诉她没找到
Tell her I didn't.

959
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,120
告诉她肯定是被扔掉了
Tell her it must have gotten thrown out,

960
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,620
让她别再问我了
and to never ask me about it again.

961
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,580
-好的  -什么好
- Good. - What do you mean "Good"?

962
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,600
从这事一开始  我就想告诉安妮塔・吉布斯
I been wanting to tell Anita Gibbs to go to hell

963
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,510
让她下地狱去
since this whole thing started.

964
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,860
罗斯先生
Mr. Ross,

965
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,470
我想给你当事人一个协议
I'd like to make your client an offer.

966
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:32,990
我们在听
We're listening.

967
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,750
我们不想抓你  迪亚兹先生
We don't want you, Mr. Diaz.

968
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,140
你说你只是在开车  我们相信你
You said you were just driving the truck and I believe you,

969
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,480
我们已经抓到了
and we already have the two gentleman

970
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,950
两位犯下重罪的男士
who committed the actual felony.

971
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:45,290
所以你要做的  就是指证他们
So, all you have to do is testify against them,

972
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,530
-然后就可以走了  -什么
- and you walk. - What?

973
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,030
老天  不用坐牢吗
Holy shit. No jail time?

974
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,530
-不用  -好  那就够了
- No jail time. - Okay that's enough.

975
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,040
-我需要跟我当事人谈谈  -不  我不用谈
- I need a moment with my client. - No, I don't need a moment.

976
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,820
-我接受  -迪亚兹先生  听我说
- I'll take it. - Mr. Diaz, listen to me.

977
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,850
指证你的朋友在目前看来可能不是大事
Testifying against your friends may not seem like a big deal

978
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,530
但你今后一生都要背负
right now, but it's something you are gonna have to live with

979
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,980
-这个罪孽  -我什么都不欠他们
- for the rest of your life. - I don't owe them anything,

980
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,910
如果我能自己脱罪  我就做
and if I can get myself off, that's what I'm gonna do.

981
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,960
他给你这个协议
He's only offering you this

982
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,480
只是因为他没有起诉你们的证据
because he doesn't have a case against you.

983
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,330
他已经输掉两个案子  我会让他再输一次
He's a two-time loser. I'll make a case against him.

984
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,310
迪亚兹先生
Mr. Diaz...

985
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,880
把笔给我
Give me the pen.

986
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,830
你在犯大错
You are making a huge mistake.

987
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,540
我不这么想
Yeah, well, I don't think so,

988
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,640
如果你在我的立场  你也会做一样的事
and if you were in my shoes, you'd do the exact same thing.

989
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,030
我绝不会把朋友送进监狱的
I would never send my friends to prison.

990
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,300
如果他们给我定罪
Yeah, well, they find me guilty,

991
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,500
也一样会送我朋友进监狱
they're gonna send my friends to prison anyways.

992
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,210
哈维  谢天谢地
Harvey, thank God.

993
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,200
陪审团出来了  我们有一小时时间
The jury came back. We have an hour.

994
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,410
-迈克呢  -我不知道
- Where's Mike? - I don't know.

995
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,170
出什么事了
What's the matter?

996
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,600
哈维
Harvey?

997
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,040
我得走了
I have to go.

998
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,280
又回来了  不是吗
Another back, right?

999
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,200
我不在乎
I don't care.

1000
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,860
我准备好接受协议了
I'm ready to take your deal.

1001
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:44,920
哪个协议
Which one?
