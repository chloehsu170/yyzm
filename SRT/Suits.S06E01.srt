{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,020
听着他的总结陈词
Listening to his closing argument,

16
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,630
我自己差点都想放他一马了
I almost want to let him go myself,

17
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,440
唯独有一个问题  他是个骗子
except for one thing-- He's a liar.

18
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,910
他觉得自己不用和你们遵守一样的规矩
He thinks he doesn't have to play by the same rules.

19
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,080
但我们知道他应该
But we know he does.

20
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,060
-你做了什么  -我认罪了
- What did you do? - I pled guilty.

21
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,410
如果你以为我会让你这么做
If you think I'm gonna let you do this,

22
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,120
你就是疯了
you're out of your goddamn mind.

23
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,520
他是为了救律所达成协议
He cut a deal to save this firm.

24
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,760
他是为了不让我们进监狱达成协议
He cut a deal to keep us from going to prison.

25
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,780
把已经想走的人给伊凡
We give Evan people who already want to go,

26
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,090
我给安妮塔・吉布斯凶手名单交换迈克
and I give Anita Gibbs murderers in exchange for Mike.

27
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,110
如果没效果然后我们什么都没了呢
And what if it doesn't work and we lose everything?

28
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,380
那就这样了  但如果没尽力救他  我们是怎样的人
Then we do. But if we don't try to save him, who are we?

29
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,140
达成协议
Make the deal.

30
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,510
我不会让你因为
I am not letting you go to prison

31
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,910
我犯下的罪责进监狱
for a crime that I committed.

32
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,390
我也不能在你会被判无罪的情况下进监狱
I'm not letting you go when you're gonna be found innocent!

33
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,700
你究竟为何要骗我
Why the hell would you lie to me?

34
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,000
因为真相会击垮你
'Cause the truth would've broken you.

35
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,450
你知道吗  哈维
You know what, Harvey?

36
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,250
你如果想参加我的婚礼  告诉我
You want to come to my wedding, you let me know.

37
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,350
我不能再什么都替你做了
I'm not trying to take your place anymore.

38
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,330
我要让你做好准备  因为你太弱了
I'm trying to get you ready because you're weak.

39
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,150
-哈维  我不弱  -那好  打我啊
- Harvey, I am not weak. - Yeah? Well, hit me.

40
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,860
这就是你想要的吗
Is this what you want?

41
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,270
想要我恨你  想要我对你这样做吗
That I hate you and that you made me do this?

42
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,320
我们因为你而失去一切
We lose everything because of you!

43
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,420
我不是说我不想结婚
I am not saying that I don't want to get married.

44
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,740
你去读完法学院
You go finish law school.

45
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,540
然后  两年后我出来
And then in two years, when I get out,

46
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,970
如果你还想嫁给我
if you still want to marry me...

47
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,280
都走了
They're all gone.

48
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,200
在里面多加小心  迈克
Watch your back in there, Mike.

49
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,280
我会的
I will.

50
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,500
所有犯人的起床时间是早晨六点
General wake-up for all inmates is at 6:00 A.M.

51
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,570
那时你要站在床边
You will be standing next to your bed at that time.

52
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,100
如果没有  将会被处罚
If you are not, you will face disciplinary action.

53
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,980
每24小时至少会
At least five inmate counts

54
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,140
随机清点五次人数
will be held during each 24-hour period at random times.

55
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,780
每次清点人数时你要立正站好
You will stand still during every one of those counts.

56
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,560
如果没有  将会被处罚
If you are not, you will face disciplinary action.

57
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,940
如果你想进食可以在规定时间内就餐
You will be at meals on time if you want to eat.

58
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,220
不管有任何情况  你都需要按时上工
You will be at work on time, no matter what.

59
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,230
你必须让你的牢房保持清洁与整齐
You will keep your cell in a clean and sanitary condition.

60
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,110
如果你无法做到上述任何一点  将会
If you fail in any of these areas, you will face...

61
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,580
被处罚
Disciplinary action.

62
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,290
很好  你学得很快
Good. You're getting the picture.

63
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,350
能不能告诉我惩罚是什么
Do you mind if I ask what disciplinary action means?

64
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,900
既然你有种问
Since you got the balls to ask that,

65
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,670
我很确定你很快就会知道
I'm sure you're gonna find out soon enough.

66
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,800
-这是干什么用的  -你觉得呢
- What's this for? - What do you think it's for?

67
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,920
脱光衣服  把所有东西都塞进这个袋子
Strip naked, put everything you own inside that bag,

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,880
然后跟我走
then follow me.

69
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,920
哈维  你怎么在这
Harvey, what are you doing here?

70
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,560
我来告诉你我把他送过去了
I came to let you know that I dropped him off,

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,520
他的状态已经算不错了
and, um, he looks as good as he could look.

72
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,870
我认为他会没事的
And I think he's gonna be okay.

73
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,140
谢谢你
I appreciate that.

74
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,940
但你完全可以在电话里告诉我这些
But you could have told me that over the phone.

75
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,930
所以你到底来干什么的
So what are you really doing here?

76
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,700
我想他
I miss him.

77
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,950
我也想他
I miss him too.

78
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,580
你要去哪
Where the hell are you going?

79
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,060
你觉得我要去哪
Where do you think I'm going?

80
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,540
-我要回家  路易  -听着  你还不懂吗
- I'm going home, Louis. - Look, don't you get it?

81
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,750
他们都走了  一个都不剩
They're all gone-- every single one of them.

82
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,040
是啊  我们已经知道了
Yeah, well, we knew that already.

83
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,380
不  我觉得你还没明白
No, no, I don't think you understand.

84
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,410
我不只是说合伙人们
I'm not just talking about the partners.

85
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,420
我是说每个人  从会计
I'm talking about everyone, from the accountants

86
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,220
到秘书  还有给我擦鞋的人  唐娜
to the secretaries to the guy who shines my shoes, Donna.

87
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,340
全都走了
All of them, gone.

88
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,240
那你想我做些什么
And what exactly do you want me to do about it?

89
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,160
我想让你给哈维打电话
I want you to get Harvey on the goddamn phone.

90
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,560
-我不会那么做的  -为什么
- Well, I'm not gonna do that. - Why not?

91
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,900
因为今晚不适合给他打电话
Because tonight's not the night to call Harvey.

92
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,480
为什么  因为迈克
Why, because of Mike?

93
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,380
我不知道你们发现没有  但迈克已经走了
I don't know if you've noticed, but Mike is gone,

94
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,700
和所有的人一起
along with everybody else.

95
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,490
如果我们今晚想不出对策
And if we don't figure something out by tonight,

96
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,250
我们就会一无所有
we are gonna be left with nothing.

97
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,440
我没有说不想对策  路易
I didn't say we weren't gonna figure something out, Louis.

98
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,650
我只是说不找哈维
I said we're not calling Harvey.

99
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,030
那我们要做什么
Well, then what the hell are we gonna do?

100
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,650
现在我要回我的办公室
Right now I'm gonna go to my office

101
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,640
给自己来一杯
and fix myself a goddamn drink.

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,740
我第一次见他吗
The first time I met him?

103
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,920
你觉得我会怎么想  我
What do you think I thought? I...

104
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,830
我认为他是个白痴
I thought he was an idiot.

105
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,840
在他进门面试不到十秒
Imagine how I felt

106
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,890
就从他的公文包里掉出来一堆大麻
when a bunch of weed spilled out of his briefcase

107
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,820
想象一下我当时的感受
ten seconds after he walked into his interview.

108
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,690
我知道  你吓坏了  拿起电话
I know. You were so horrified, you got on the phone,

109
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,750
然后报了警
and you called the police.

110
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,210
等等  你没这么做
No, wait. You didn't do that.

111
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,560
你给了那个白痴一份工作
You offered the idiot a job.

112
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,340
那是因为听完他的故事
That's because after I heard his story,

113
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,530
我才知道他原来不是个白痴
I knew he wasn't an idiot after all.

114
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,600
而那一早上过去
And I knew by the end of that first morning

115
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,220
我就知道他和我认识的人都不一样
that he wasn't like anyone I'd ever met,

116
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,610
要是我不小心  就会陷入大麻烦
and that if I wasn't careful, I was gonna be in trouble.

117
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,620
-敬麻烦  -敬麻烦
- To trouble. - To trouble.

118
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,010
瞧瞧  路易给我留言了
Look at that. Louis left me a voice mail.

119
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,030
我不明白  你好像还很高兴
I don't understand. You seem happy about that.

120
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,870
因为我最喜欢的消遣之一
That's because one of my favorite pastimes

121
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,700
就是听路易的留言
is to listen to one of Louis's messages.

122
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,190
要是他在郁闷呢
What if he's upset about something?

123
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,540
他永远都在郁闷
He's always upset about something.

124
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,070
所以听他的留言
That's why one of my favorite pastimes

125
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,950
才是我最喜欢的消遣之一
is to listen to one of Louis's messages.

126
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,840
该死的哈维  给我接电话
Damn it, Harvey, pick up the goddamn phone,

127
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,790
因为整个律所人去楼空了
because this entire firm is a ghost town,

128
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,300
我是很遗憾迈克进了监狱
and I'm sorry Mike's in prison,

129
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,820
但如果我们不想出对策
but if we don't figure something out,

130
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,320
你和你的小跟班的这次壮举
what you and your little sidekick did

131
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,660
就是我们的落幕了
is gonna be the end of us.

132
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,170
还有别给我说什么今晚不合适的鬼话
And don't give me some bullshit about tonight isn't the time,

133
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:01,970
因为
because--

134
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,770
我得走了
I got to go.

135
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,040
我知道  我也去
Yeah, I know. I'm coming with you.

136
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,660
瑞秋  你听到路易的话了
Rachel, you heard what Louis said.

137
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,610
今晚肯定不会好过  你还是留下吧
This is gonna be a rough night. You need to stay here.

138
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,390
哈维  不管我今晚在哪肯定都不会好过
Harvey, it's gonna be a rough night no matter where I am.

139
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,770
至少如果和你在一起
And at least if I'm with you,

140
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,270
我还可能有机会派上用场
there's a chance that I could be of some use.

141
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,600
那你最好穿衣服  我们时间不多
You better get your coat, because we don't have much time.

142
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,700
然后呢
Now what?

143
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,240
然后穿衣服  等着
Now you get dressed, and you wait.

144
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,340
还想再喝点什么吗
Would you like some more drinks?

145
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,700
要不要碟开胃菜  或者松露薯条
Can I offer you an appetizer, maybe some truffle fries,

146
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,030
还是我们可以谈谈工作了
or are we allowed to talk business now?

147
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,860
好吧  路易  既然是你的建议让我们
All right, Louis, what do you think we should do,

148
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,400
落到了这个境地
since it was your recommendation

149
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,190
那你认为我们现在该怎么做
that landed us in this mess in the first place?

150
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,350
我当时那么建议是因为那是最后一个
I recommended that because it was a last-ditch effort

151
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,420
避免迈克牢狱之灾的办法
to get Mike out of prison.

152
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,510
你也说了我们只有一半合伙人会投靠
And you also said we'd only lose 50%

153
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,180
伊凡・施密斯
of our partners to Evan Smith.

154
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,820
我怎么能知道她有本事
How could I have known that she had the capacity

155
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,660
招走一半多呢
to bring on more than that?

156
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,600
你还不懂吗  其他人没有投靠伊凡・施密斯
Don't you get it? The rest didn't go to Evan Smith.

157
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,290
他们只是离开了这里去了别处
They just walked the hell out and went somewhere else.

158
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,420
那我们可以告他们
Then we can sue their asses.

159
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,930
哪里有律师  有资源  有钱告
With what lawyers, what resources, and what money?

160
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,140
因为你可能还没注意到
Because I don't know if you noticed,

161
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,420
但我们律所已经因为你的建议被掏空了
but this firm has been gutted because of your recommendation.

162
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,510
不  杰西卡  它是因为我的建议被掏空的
No, Jessica, it was gutted because of mine.

163
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,530
该死的  路易  我说了让你别找他的
Damn it, Louis. I told you not to call him.

164
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,870
我还是找了  因为他也是合伙人
Well, I did. Because he's a partner,

165
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,440
而且如他所说  提出免除竞业条款的
and like he just said, he was the one

166
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,480
本来就是他
who wanted to sever the noncompetes in the first place.

167
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,010
没错  路易  是我
You're right, Louis. I did.

168
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,220
但我不是来
But I didn't come down here

169
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,870
确认哈维该负责任的
to play Pin the Blame on the Harvey.

170
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,150
我来是为了想办法解决问题
I came down here to figure out what the hell we're gonna do.

171
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,280
那就解决啊
Then let's get to it.

172
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,330
-有事吗  -抱歉打扰了
- May I help you? - Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt,

173
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,510
但前台没有人
but there was no one at reception,

174
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,760
这是您点的餐
and I have your order here.

175
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,910
你逗我呢吧
You got to be kidding me.

176
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,500
你说有急事把我叫来
You call me down here for an emergency,

177
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,320
居然还有闲情逸致点外卖
and then you take the time to order Chinese food?

178
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,810
我没点外卖  你个白痴
I didn't order anything, asshole.

179
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,860
所以别跟我张牙舞爪的
So you crouch your tiger, hide your dragon,

180
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,550
否则我就把你丢出去
or I'm gonna Wang Chung your ass out of here.

181
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,320
路易  镇定  显然这是误会
Louis, calm down. Clearly, there's some mistake.

182
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,700
这律所没人点过外卖
No one at this firm has ordered any food.

183
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,370
我很确定地方没错
Well, I'm pretty sure this is the right place,

184
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,190
因为门上写着杰西卡・皮尔逊
because the name on your door says Jessica Pearson,

185
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,820
这份外卖就是杰西卡・皮尔逊的
and this order is for a Jessica Pearson.

186
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,560
-她就是杰西卡・皮尔逊  -路易
- Yeah this is Jessica Pearson. - Louis!

187
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,380
怎么了
What?

188
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,460
他们知道我其实不是
They know I'm not really here

189
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,210
来送蛋卷的  白痴
to bring you an egg roll, asshole.

190
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,800
我是来送这个的
I'm here to serve you with this.

191
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,420
-那是什么  -集体诉讼
- What is that? - It's a class action.

192
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,570
我们因为迈克・罗斯接触过的所有案子被告了
We're being sued for every case Mike Ross has ever touched.

193
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,700
所以他们才跑光了
That's why they all left.

194
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,380
他们知道会有这事  所以都离开了
They knew this was coming, and they got out

195
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,720
这样他们就能说
so they could all have it on record

196
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,150
诉讼发生时他们已经离开公司了
that they were gone before the suit came down.

197
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,030
那我们需要知道是谁告诉他们的
Then we need to know who the hell tipped them off.

198
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,590
谁说的都不重要
It doesn't matter who tipped them off.

199
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,990
重要的是  如果我们输了
What matters is, if we lose this suit,

200
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,220
绝对付不起罚金
we can't handle the money.

201
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,670
他们要多少
How much are they suing us for?

202
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,440
-1个亿  -该死的
- $100 million. - God damn it.

203
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,680
我们得把那些合伙人找回来
We need to get those partners back.

204
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,520
我说了  找不回来的
I told you, we're never gonna get them back.

205
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,260
而且现在我们连他们去了哪都不知道
And right now we don't even know where they went.

206
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,050
我知道
I do.

207
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,690
你是怎么做到的
How the hell did you pull that off?

208
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,500
因为律师之间不交心
Because lawyers don't talk to lawyers,

209
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,800
但秘书之间常八卦
but secretaries talk to secretaries.

210
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,210
这张表上列明了大家的去向
That is a list of who went where.

211
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,310
好了  我们今晚就需要书面记录
Okay, we need a paper trail tonight--

212
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,810
需要发违约通告
notices of breach of contract--

213
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,980
要正式声明那些合伙人
and we need to get on record

214
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,730
并不是离开了就一了百了了
that those partners aren't off the hook.

215
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,100
现在发违约通告已经晚了
It's too late to send out notices.

216
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,630
我们已经接到诉讼文书了
We already got served with the lawsuit.

217
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,140
他刚刚没有记录时间
He didn't record the time.

218
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,190
唐娜  我桌上的雪茄盒里有五千美元
Donna, there's $5,000 in the cigar box on my desk.

219
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,000
去把它拿过来
Get it now.

220
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,000
等等  你这又是要去哪里
Wait. Where the hell are you going?

221
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,240
我要下楼
I'm going downstairs

222
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,330
告诉那个送文书的他可以把钱全拿走
to tell that server he can have every nickel of it

223
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,490
只要他声明那份文书是两小时之后才送来的
to say he didn't deliver that thing for another two hours.

224
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,150
假设哈维成功
Assuming Harvey doesn't shit the bed,

225
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,590
我们就有两个小时来想办法
we've got two hours to figure out

226
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,860
怎样让这表上的每个合伙人都收到文书
how we're gonna serve every partner on this list.

227
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,830
把表给我
Give me that list.

228
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,660
他们一定会收到文书的
They can consider themselves served,

229
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,160
因为路易・马洛・利特从不在战斗中让步
because Louis Marlowe Litt never backs down from a fight.

230
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,210
丹伯里联邦惩教所  
Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury.

231
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,550
您好  我打电话来想问问...
Yes, I'm--I'm calling to check on an--

232
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,360
犯人的情况
Inmate?

233
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,950
没错  他叫迈克・罗斯  他...
Yeah. His name is Michael Ross, and he--

234
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,550
抱歉  女士
I'm sorry, ma'am.

235
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,680
我不能透露犯人的相关信息
I can't give out information regarding inmates.

236
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,940
那您至少能告诉我
Would you at least be able to tell me

237
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,100
他是否被接收入狱了吗
if he's been processed yet?

238
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,140
假如他是自己过来报到的
If he surrendered himself,

239
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,550
那就已经入狱了
then he has been processed.

240
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,570
好的  那意味着他现在在牢房里还是...
Okay, so does that mean that he's in a cell now or--

241
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,850
女士  我是监狱管理员  不是酒店前台
Ma'am, I'm a prison administrator, not a hotel concierge.

242
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,940
我也不知道任意时刻中某个犯人的具体情况
I don't know the whereabouts of any given inmate at any given time.

243
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,460
好吧  那您能告诉我我什么时候能见他吗
Okay, would you be able to tell me when I can see him?

244
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,460
你是他配偶或直系亲属吗
Are you his spouse or immediate family?

245
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,110
不是
No.

246
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,200
那你就得申请  然后等审批
Then you'll have to go through the approval process.

247
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,430
但他没有任何直系亲属了
But he doesn't have any immediate family,

248
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,780
而我是他的未婚妻
and I'm his fiancée.

249
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,670
除非你们有正式的结婚证书
And unless you have a filed marriage certificate,

250
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,280
不然就得等到下个月了
you'll have to wait till next month.

251
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,310
下个月
Next month?

252
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,310
我...我能请问一下您的名字吗
Look, am I--am I allowed to ask your name?

253
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,630
我叫露丝
My name is Ruth.

254
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,320
露丝  迈克和我...
Ruth, Mike and I were...

255
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,010
本来应该今天结婚的  但我们没结成
supposed to be married today, but we weren't.

256
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,520
我忍不住一直想着他
And I can't stop thinking about him,

257
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,250
要是不知道他是否安好
and I'm not gonna be able to sleep

258
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,410
我完全无法入睡
unless I know that he's gonna be okay.

259
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,070
他可是在监狱里啊  女士
He's in prison, ma'am.

260
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,020
这还真不好说
I really couldn't say.

261
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,620
抱歉
I am sorry.

262
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,620
没什么比监狱蓝衣更能让你意识到
Nothing like prison blue to make you realize

263
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,410
人靠衣装这句话是错的  是吧
the clothes don't make the man, huh?

264
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,770
-是克拉克典狱长吗  -我吗
- Warden Clark? - Me?

265
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,040
不是
No.

266
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,950
谁告诉你你会见到典狱长的
Who told you you were going to meet the warden?

267
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,540
没有人  我只是以为...
Uh, no one. I-I just thought--

268
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,190
以为这会和监狱题材的电影一样
That this was going to be like a prison movie.

269
00:10:49,190 --> 00:11:00,410
{\an8}台词和接下来的海报盖住的洞的梗
都出自《肖申克的救赎》

270
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,510
"爱信上帝信上帝
"Put your trust in the Lord,

271
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,450
但你的贱命是我的了"这类的狗屁
but your ass belongs to me" type shit.

272
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,550
你看过《肖申克的救赎》
You know "Shawshank"?

273
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,520
你当然看过《肖申克的救赎》
Of course you know "Shawshank."

274
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,510
你可是在监狱里工作的
You work in a prison.

275
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,920
不  兄弟  我看过《肖申克的救赎》
No, brother, I know "Shawshank"

276
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,410
是因为这是有史以来最伟大的电影  给
because it's the greatest movie ever made. Here...

277
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,230
这是什么
What's this?

278
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,860
你的心理评估表
Your psychological evaluation.

279
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,370
我什么要进行心理评估
Why do I need a psychological evaluation?

280
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,660
因为联邦监狱系统是这么规定的
Because the federal penitentiary system says you do.

281
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,790
等下我回来的时候  假如镜子上有个洞
Now, when I get back, if there's a hole in the mirror

282
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,690
上面盖着丽塔・海华丝的海报
covered by a Rita Hayworth poster,

283
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,280
我可不会高兴的
I will not be happy.

284
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,570
行了  路易  冷静下来
Okay, Louis, calm down.

285
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,950
你哑了几次火  可能还中风了
You've had a few misfires, possibly had a stroke,

286
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,950
但你可以的
but you can do this.

287
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,290
你输入了有关信息
You've entered the requisite information.

288
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,080
你完美地校准了字体
You calibrated the typeface perfectly.

289
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,860
你现在只需要按下"发送"键
All you have to do is press "send,"

290
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,460
然后那些贱人们就要被"利击"了
and those sons of bitches are about to get Litt the hell up.

291
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,750
-我操你...  -你在干什么
- God damn mother-- - What the hell are you doing?

292
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,320
我只是在排查故障  怎么了
I'm just doing a little troubleshooting. Why?

293
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,420
那可是40万美元的硬件
That is a $400,000 piece of hardware,

294
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,890
你没有权力...
and you have no business even--

295
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,480
等等  你还留在这里干什么
Wait a second. What are you still doing here?

296
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,970
干任何称职的技术人员该干的事
What any IT officer worth his salt would do.

297
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,660
我在维护我们的系统  这样在外界看来
I'm maintaining our system, so it appears we're still

298
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,230
我们还是一个正常运转的律所
a functioning law firm to the outside world.

299
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,180
你能在两小时之内把法律通告
Can you electronically serve legal notice

300
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,920
电子送达给各位合伙人吗
to every partner in the next two hours?

301
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,650
只要你有他们的正式工作地址
As long as you've got their official business addresses,

302
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,110
我两分钟后就能搞定
I can do it in the next two minutes.

303
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,700
正好我手头就有这些信息
Well, it's a good thing I have them right here.

304
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,850
无意冒犯  但我真的比较习惯单干
Um, no offense, but I'm really more of a lone ranger.

305
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,390
你说什么
Excuse me?

306
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,350
你别趴在我身上盯着
I can get this done in a more efficient manner

307
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,960
我的效率更高
without you looking over my shoulder.

308
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,860
我当年看我的第一本《花花公子》时
Well, that's what I told my mother

309
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,210
也是这么和我妈说的
when I looked at my first "Playboy."

310
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,140
当时行不通  现在也行不通
But it didn't happen then, and it's not gonna happen now.

311
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,510
这都无关紧要了  因为...
Well, that doesn't matter because...

312
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,620
我们遇到麻烦了
we have a problem.

313
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,440
所以你的意思是  在这个办公室里
So you're saying, in this office,

314
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,760
一直以来
at any given moment,

315
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,160
都藏着十万美元
there's $100,000 hidden away.

316
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,200
-就是这个意思  -藏在哪里
- That's what I'm saying. - Where?

317
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,280
我才不会告诉你
I'm not telling you.

318
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,080
不管你们两个在忙什么
Whatever the hell you two are in the middle of,

319
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,220
都得停一停了
it's gonna have to wait,

320
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,260
因为尽管秘书之间常八卦
because secretaries may talk to secretaries,

321
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,000
但骗子也专骗傻子
but liars talk to idiots.

322
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,210
路易  你这话是什么意思
Louis, what the hell are you talking about?

323
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,360
我的意思是那个列表纯粹就是扯淡
I'm saying that that list is a bucket of bullshit,

324
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,550
而伟大的唐娜・鲍尔森
and the mighty Donna Paulsen--

325
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,680
完全没搞清楚状况
she doesn't know her ass from her elbow.

326
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,740
说话注意点  路易
Watch yourself, Louis.

327
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,240
我没必要注意  哈维
I don't need to watch myself, Harvey.

328
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,420
我不知道你有留意到没
See, I don't know if you've noticed,

329
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,130
我们可是被人索赔一亿美元
but we're being sued for a $100 million.

330
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,270
合伙人都走了  我们却只能眼睁睁看着
The partners are gone, and we can't stop them.

331
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,660
也许我们不必阻止他们
Maybe we don't have to stop them.

332
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,270
什么意思
What are you saying?

333
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,130
我现在想知道的是咱们加起来有多少身家
What I want to know right now is what we're all worth.

334
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:13,760
什么  你在说笑吗
What, are you kidding?

335
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,080
你怎么不干脆拿电牛棒捅我菊花呢
Why don't you just jam a cattle prod up my ass?

336
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,120
这样对我伤害还小点
It would be less invasive.

337
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,340
你再乱来
I'll jam my fist in your face

338
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,820
我就一拳打到你脸上
if you don't start getting with the program.

339
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,010
又来了  暴力解决一切  死性不改
There you go, resorting to violence, like you always do.

340
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,100
就因为你不想承认这整件事
Because you don't want to admit this whole thing

341
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,500
都是因你的错而起
is your fault in the first place.

342
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,760
我的错吗  要不是我把迈克招进来
My fault? If I hadn't brought Mike in,

343
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,660
你到现在还只能跟个初级合伙人一样
you'd still be here sniveling around

344
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,260
在这里哭天喊地
like a goddamn junior partner.

345
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,750
要不是我把唐娜送回给你
And if I hadn't given Donna back to you,

346
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,830
你的恐慌症到现在都好不了
you'd still be having panic attacks

347
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,850
就跟个娘们一样
like a goddamn little girl.

348
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,450
-路易  -你这个狗屁东西
- Louis! - You smug son of a bitch.

349
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,710
够了
That's enough!

350
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,370
我刚目送自己心爱的男人入狱
I just watched the man that I love go to prison

351
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,790
好让你们不受牵连
so none of you have to.

352
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,440
结果现在五分钟不到...
And it hasn't been five minutes...

353
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,930
你们就已经吵得不可开交了
And you're already ripping each other apart.

354
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,840
-瑞秋...  -让我说完
- Rachel... - Let me finish.

355
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,410
我本来想今晚一个人静静
I thought I wanted to be alone tonight.

356
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,620
但我想还是算了
And then I realized that I didn't,

357
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,880
因为我要和家人在一起
because I wanted to be with my family.

358
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,260
但不说平时  如果今晚你们还不能
But if you can't keep it together tonight...

359
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,880
团结在一起  那我想...
of all nights, then as far as I'm concerned...

360
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,640
你们都可以下地狱了
you can all rot in hell.

361
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,110
我来把她说不出口的话给说了吧
Well, I'm gonna say what she won't.

362
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,330
这都是你的错
This is all on you.

363
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,710
路易  这里也是我今晚最不想来的地方
Louis, this is the last place I wanted to be tonight too,

364
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,670
但我还是回来拯救我的律所了
but I came back here to save my firm anyway.

365
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
如果你还是死性不改
But if you're gonna be the same old Louis

366
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,150
还是要跟我像平时一样闹
and we're going to do the same old dance,

367
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,080
那你也可以抱着律所一起下地狱了
then maybe you and this firm can both go rot in hell.

368
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,000
路易  我不想听你说那话
Louis, I don't want to hear it.

369
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,870
很好  因为我也不是要来说那话的
Well, that's good, because I'm not here to say it.

370
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,530
你是说你专门跑下来
Are you saying you didn't come down here

371
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,170
不是为了跟我抱怨哈维的吗
to tell me Harvey can go to hell?

372
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,700
我跑下来是为了跟你说
I'm saying I came down here to tell you,

373
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,070
如果哈维想一走了之的话...
if Harvey wants to go...

374
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,310
-我们就放他走吧  -路易
- we should let him. - Louis.

375
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,650
杰西卡  你曾经跟我说过
Jessica, you once told me,

376
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,400
无论发生什么事情
no matter what happens,

377
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,790
皮尔逊会一直把利特看作自己的合伙人
Pearson will always consider Litt her partner,

378
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,880
这就意味着不管哈维如何...
which means whatever happens with Harvey...

379
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,770
我们都会同舟共济
we can do this together.

380
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,650
你怎么看  你我联手
What do you say-- you and me?

381
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,870
皮尔逊-利特律师事务所
Pearson Litt.

382
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,460
你不愿意
You say no.

383
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,390
-不是的  路易  -我早该知道了
- No, Louis-- - I should have known.

384
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,520
你一直都不喜欢我
You never wanted me.

385
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,210
你想要的只有那珍贵无比的哈维
All you ever wanted was your precious Harvey.

386
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,240
路易  你根本不知道我想要什么
Louis, you have no idea what I want.

387
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,410
我会犹豫也不是因为你
And my hesitation has nothing to do with you.

388
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,300
那到底是怎么回事
Then what exactly does it have to do with?

389
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,250
路易...
Louis...

390
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,800
一直以来我都在不惜一切代价
I have put everything I have into keeping this firm afloat

391
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,610
保护着这家律所
for as long as I can remember.

392
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,050
但你看看这里
Well, now look around you.

393
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,530
这艘船不是岌岌可危  而是已经沉到海底了
The ship isn't sinking. It sunk.

394
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,870
我都不知道自己是否有能力
And I don't know if I have it in me

395
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,380
把它从大洋深处
to pull it back up

396
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,120
给捞回来了
from the bottom of the ocean.

397
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,210
你终于回来了
Finally.

398
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,840
什么
Excuse me?

399
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,140
他们三小时前就跑过来把那东西给拿走了
They came and took that thing away three hours ago.

400
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,460
而我却只能坐在这里玩自己的手指
I've been sitting here twiddling my thumbs ever since.

401
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,130
你不是在玩手指
You were not twiddling your thumbs.

402
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,570
你是在等我浏览测试结果
You were waiting for me to go over the results of that thing.

403
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,730
然而从结果看  你就是在胡扯
And the results are you are full of shit.

404
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,320
-你说什么  -你没听错
- Excuse me? - You heard me.

405
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,120
每个问题我都是如实作答的
I answered every one of those questions honestly.

406
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,030
我没说你不诚实
I didn't say you didn't.

407
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,900
既然如此  我想你不怎么清楚状况
Well, in that case, I guess you didn't get the memo.

408
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,470
这监狱里关的都是骗子
We're in a prison filled with con men.

409
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,940
所有人的话都不可信
Everyone here is full of shit.

410
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,540
但你和他们之间的区别在于
And the difference between you and them

411
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,750
他们知道自己在说谎
is they know they are.

412
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,210
你的话我已经听不懂了
What does that even mean?

413
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,260
意思就是  他们知道自己没有耐心
It means that they know they don't have the patience

414
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,870
合法赚取到自己想要的东西
to earn what they want,

415
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,450
因此才去从别人手中去偷
and that's why they go out and steal it from other people.

416
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,690
你就是因为这个才冷落我这么久
So that's why you left me in here all that time,

417
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,390
就是为了证明我没有耐心
just to prove that I have no patience.

418
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,300
第二项测试  自恋倾向
Evaluation number two, narcissistic tendencies.

419
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,280
世界不是围着你转的
The world does not revolve around you.

420
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,190
我没必要听你说这番话
You know what? I don't have to listen to this.

421
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,630
没错  因为我今天的工作结束了
No, you don't, because my day is done.

422
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,000
我要回到家里
And I'm going to go home,

423
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,030
给自己倒杯冰镇啤酒
pour myself a cold beer

424
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,160
然而你只能待在
while you get settled in cell 42

425
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,660
D区南边的42号牢房里
on the south end of D block.

426
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,790
我懂了
Yeah, I get it.

427
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,600
我不再是那个迈克・罗斯了
I'm no longer Mike Ross.

428
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,680
我只是编号为53296的囚犯
I'm just inmate number 53296.

429
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,570
不  你依旧是迈克・罗斯
No, you're still Mike Ross.

430
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,010
而我的任务是让你在刑满释放时
But my job is to help you become a better version of him

431
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,850
成为一个更好的你
when you leave than when you came in.

432
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,440
如果你相信我  就有可能实现
And if you trust me, that just might happen.

433
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,510
相信你
Trust you?

434
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,660
你上次进来时装作跟我跟我同一战线的样子
You came in here before acting like you were on my side.

435
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,210
我们来把话说清楚
Let's get one thing straight.

436
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,900
我什么都没有装
I didn't act anything.

437
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,180
你步伐轻盈地走进来
You waltzed in here thinking

438
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,200
以为这会跟监狱电影的桥段一样
this was gonna be like some prison movie.

439
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,040
然而现实并非如此  接受现实吧
Well, it's not, so get that through your head.

440
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,510
这不是监狱电影  哥们
It's not a movie, brother.

441
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,380
是监狱
It's just prison.

442
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,680
{\an8}皮尔森-斯佩克特-利特
律师事务所

443
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,040
你敢按那按钮
Don't you dare push that button.

444
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,240
哈维  你今晚不能走
You're not leaving, Harvey, not tonight.

445
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,420
-不  我要走  -如果你真的要走
- Yes, I am. - Well, if you really mean that,

446
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,870
那真是让我大失所望
then you're not the man I thought you were.

447
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,880
你说什么
What did you just say to me?

448
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,170
我是说  隐藏在这套昂贵的西装
I said that underneath that expensive suit

449
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,390
和完美履历这些光鲜艳丽的外表背后的
and that perfect record is a coward

450
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,390
是一个打算在此生最大战役中当逃兵的懦夫
ready to run from one of the biggest fights of his life.

451
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,360
我没有逃避什么  唐娜
I am not running from anything, Donna,

452
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,690
我现在也不想听你说这些
and I don't need this right now.

453
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,690
不  哈维  这番话就该现在讲给你听
No, Harvey, right now is exactly when you need this,

454
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,070
因为到了明天  一切都来不及了
because tomorrow's gonna be too late.

455
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,110
我知道自己在干什么
I know what I'm doing.

456
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,380
那不妨说出来让我听听
Then why don't you enlighten me?

457
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,460
因为我
Because I, for one,

458
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,740
就十分想知道你在干什么
would love to know exactly what you're doing.

459
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,620
我要回家从此不再回头
I'm gonna go the hell home and never look back.

460
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,710
那明天怎么办
And what about tomorrow?

461
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,800
我不在乎明天会怎样
I don't care about tomorrow.

462
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,490
也许你该为明天担忧了
Well, maybe you should start caring about tomorrow,

463
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,490
否则的话
because if you don't,

464
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,810
三周后你清醒过来
you're gonna wake up three weeks from now,

465
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,230
就会意识到
and you're gonna realize that this

466
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,290
这是你这辈子最大的错误
was the biggest mistake of your life,

467
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,610
你所做的就是在放弃
and all you did was give up

468
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,460
迈克入狱所换来的一切
exactly what Mike went to prison to save.

469
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,790
迈克入狱不是为了挽救这该死的律所
Mike did not go to prison to save this goddamn firm.

470
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,920
没错  哈维  他是为了救我们
No, Harvey, he went to prison to save us.

471
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,300
然而如今你又要抛下我们不管
And now you're walking out on us.

472
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,080
如果你真的要走  那你告诉我
And if you're gonna do that, then tell me,

473
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,840
他的拯救还有何意义
what did he save us for?

474
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,440
我们来把话说清楚
Let's get one thing straight.

475
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,600
你步伐轻盈地走进来
You waltzed in here thinking

476
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,710
以为这会跟监狱电影的桥段一样
this was gonna be like a prison movie.

477
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,120
然而现实并非如此
Well, it's not.

478
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,080
罗斯
Ross.

479
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,870
这不是监狱电影  哥们
It's not a movie, brother.

480
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,280
是监狱
It's just prison.

481
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,580
是监狱
It's just prison.

482
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,510
罗斯
Ross.

483
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,620
听到我说话了吗
Did you hear me?

484
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,810
第一天来就想找不自在吗
We gonna have trouble your first night?

485
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,120
-不想  -那就快进去
- No. - Then get in there.

486
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,030
还有件事...
One more thing...

487
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,480
你今晚不许再出这间牢房了
you're not authorized to leave this cell the rest of the night.

488
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,480
抱歉  杰西卡
Jessica, I'm sorry.

489
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,530
我以前就坐在这个位子
You know, this used to be my desk.

490
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,450
桌子换了  但位置没变
Different desk, same spot.

491
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,360
杰克森坐那  伯恩斯在那个位子
Jackson was there, Burns was there,

492
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,240
克莱曼坐在门旁边
and Kleiman was by the door.

493
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,490
他不喜欢坐门旁边
He hated being by the door.

494
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,250
这几个名字我都没听说过
I don't know any of those names.

495
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,940
因为他们很久前就辞职了
Because they got out a long time ago,

496
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,180
因为不是所有人都喜欢这种生活
because this life isn't for everyone.

497
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,700
而这种生活对某些人来说格外艰辛
And it's harder on some than it is on others.

498
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,430
-我不懂  -我的意思是...
- What are you saying? - I'm saying that...

499
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,780
对于女人来讲  规则是不同的
for women, the rules are different.

500
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,020
你不能和所有人成为朋友
You can't be everyone's friend

501
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,840
邀请他们喝茶  因为
and invite them to tea because...

502
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,060
温柔等于软弱
warm means you're weak.

503
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,940
我不愿意软弱
I wasn't gonna be weak.

504
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,660
但这事的另一面是
But now the flip side to that is,

505
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,250
如果你很坚强  人们会认为你很冷漠
if you're strong, they think you're cold.

506
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,080
所以他们都走了
And that's why they're all gone...

507
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,520
因为他们把我看作
because they see me as...

508
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,500
一个毫无情感  控制欲很强的人
as unfeeling and manipulative.

509
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,110
我已经受够
I'm tired of it.

510
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,680
他们错了
Well, they're wrong.

511
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,670
你之所以这么说是因为
You're just saying that

512
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,890
你看到了我现在这个样子
because you're seeing me like this.

513
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,490
不  与这件事无关
No, that has nothing to do with it.

514
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,330
我父亲告诉我
My dad told me

515
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,390
他今天来教堂的唯一原因就是
that the only reason he came to the church today

516
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,330
你告诉他如果他不去
was because you told him if he didn't,

517
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,010
他就将永远失去我
he would lose me forever.

518
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:40,970
你那么做并不是
And you didn't do that

519
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,910
因为你想控制什么局面
because you were trying to manipulate some situation.

520
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,300
你那么做因为你在乎
You did it because you care.

521
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,440
也正因为你那样做了
And because you did it,

522
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,750
我会永远忠诚于你
I will be loyal to you forever.

523
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,520
有什么事吗  哈维
What can I do for you, Harvey?

524
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,710
我来是想跟你说对不起
I came to tell you that I'm sorry.

525
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,940
你确实该说
You should be.

526
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,560
我知道
I know.

527
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,270
那你是要臭骂我一顿
So you gonna give me a tongue lashing,

528
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,060
还是来想办法逃脱眼下的困境
or you want to figure out how we can get out of this jackpot?

529
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,640
我认为现在你和我还有路易
I think that right now you and me and Louis

530
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,560
应该找个屋子抽根烟  和好
should get in a room and smoke a peace pipe.

531
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,750
你说的是我想的那个意思吗
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

532
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,910
当然了
I sure as hell am.

533
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,010
那这么晚了  我们去哪
And where exactly are we gonna get that shit

534
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,860
能弄到
this late at night?

535
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,410
因为办公室的茶水小弟早就走了
'Cause the coffee cart guy is long gone.

536
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,560
正巧了
It just so happens

537
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,570
有时我就是喜欢自己泡咖啡
I like to brew my own coffee from time to time.

538
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,740
我去喝一杯吧
I'm gonna go get a drink.

539
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,250
那是非法的  你知道
That stuff's illegal, you know.

540
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,790
把那个放下
Put that down.

541
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,600
-对不起  我没有想要  -碰我的东西
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-- - Touch my stuff?

542
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,700
真好笑  我可没看见那张照片自己跳到你手上
Funny, I didn't see the picture jump into your hands by itself.

543
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,670
听着  我只是
Look, I was just--

544
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,960
放松  我逗你的
Relax, I'm just giving you shit.

545
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,230
那是我的小侄女  很好的孩子
That's my little nephew-- sweet kid,

546
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,010
跟石头一样没脑
dumb as a box of rocks.

547
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,800
欢迎来到丹伯里  你叫什么
Welcome to Danbury. What's your name?

548
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,640
迈克  迈克・罗斯
Mike. Mike Ross.

549
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,610
弗兰克・加洛
Frank Gallo.

550
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,680
迈克  看来咱俩在很长一段时间里
Well, Mike, looks like we're gonna be sharing

551
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,640
需要共享这个小套间了
this little condo for a while.

552
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,380
想跟我说说你是为什么进来的吗
Feel like telling me what you're in for?

553
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,370
我知道了  你不确定能不能信任我
I get it. You don't know if you can trust me.

554
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,580
事实上  你不能信任这里的任何人
Listen, truth is, you shouldn't trust anybody in here.

555
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,860
只是我刚问你的是你犯了什么事
Except I just asked what you did,

556
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,370
很显然他们已经逮到你了
and they obviously already caught you,

557
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,430
你能有什么损失呢
so what's the harm?

558
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,380
如果没有损失
Well, if there's no harm,

559
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,010
那你为什么不告诉我你为什么进来呢
then why don't you tell me what you're in for?

560
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,120
那说来话长了
That could take a while.

561
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,750
我不知道你是什么情况
I don't know about you,

562
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,850
但我接下来的两年都很闲
but I'm free for the next two years.

563
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,900
小心点
Careful.

564
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,970
你看  你已经告诉我你要呆多久了
See, now you've told me how long you're in for.

565
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,440
开始透露了信息  到最后你就会连
Starts there, ends with you telling me

566
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,470
你是生来贫穷的黑人孩子的底都透露给我
you were born a poor black child.

567
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,210
-你看过《混蛋》  -是啊  你也看过
- You know "The Jerk"? - Yeah, you know "The Jerk"?

568
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,000
我小时候看过很多电影
Yeah, I watched a lot of movies growing up.

569
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,810
我们在这里会看很多电影
We watch a lot of movies in here.

570
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,640
好吧  你想听我的故事
All right, you want to know my story?

571
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,740
那要从我犯事的很久以前开始讲
It starts long before I did what I did,

572
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,420
因为我不是个生来贫穷的黑人孩子
because I wasn't born a poor black child,

573
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,060
但我确实是个贫穷的孩子
but I was born poor,

574
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,790
这也让我非常想变得富有
which made me susceptible to wanting to be rich.

575
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,560
我当然会为我自己考虑
Of course I'm thinking about myself.

576
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,650
怎么  你就不会吗
What, you wouldn't?

577
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,710
拜托  为了救你自己  你都能
Please, you'd throw a giraffe off of Noah's Ark

578
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,320
把诺亚方舟的长颈鹿挤下去
just to save your sorry ass.

579
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,540
没准就是因为你的某个祖先
The world's probably without unicorns

580
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,660
世界上才没有独角兽的  我
because of one of your ancestors, and I--

581
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,630
能让我先说完吗  我的天哪
Will you just let me finish a thought, for God's sake?

582
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,420
路易  你在干什么
Louis? What exactly are you doing?

583
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,990
你看我像是在干什么
Well, what does it look like I'm doing?

584
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,250
我在和我死去秘书的骨灰
I'm having a discussion about the fate of the firm

585
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,100
讨论律所的命运问题
with my dead secretary's ashes.

586
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,490
好吧  既然不是什么过于怪异的事就算了
Well, as long as it's not something weird.

587
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,930
那你们两个在过去的这半个小时又做了什么呢
What exactly have you two been doing the last half hour?

588
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,040
你马上要做的事
The same thing you're about to do.

589
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,220
不可能  我才不会抽大麻
No way, I'm not doing the Mary Jane.

590
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,050
-你会的  -我才不会吞云吐雾
- Yes, you are. - I'm not huffing and puffing.

591
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,610
-路易  这是唯一的方法  -不  我不做违法的事
- Louis, it's the only way. - No, I'm not doing the dirty.

592
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,650
没事的  交给我
It's okay. I got this.

593
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,980
我是说  路易不想抽  也许诺玛想呢
I mean, if Louis doesn't want to smoke it, maybe Norma does.

594
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,150
你敢
Don't you dare.

595
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,310
放松  路易
Relax, Louis.

596
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,510
这又不会害死她
It's not like it's gonna kill her.

597
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,920
哈维  这不是闹着玩的  好吗
Harvey, that is not funny, okay?

598
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,140
你会把她骨灰弄脏的
You're gonna get ashes in her ashes.

599
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,380
那你自己来抽啊
Then why don't you just smoke it yourself?

600
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,990
-灭了火  -就不
- Put that out. - Nope.

601
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,880
倒数三个数我要把这支大麻点了  一
I'm gonna light this joint on the count of one...

602
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,460
-哈维  我告诉你  -二
- Harvey, I'm telling you. - Two...

603
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,710
-哈维  -三
- Harvey! - Three.

604
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,040
你改主意了吗
Did you pull your back out?

605
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,460
把那玩意给我
Give me the goddamn thing.

606
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,740
我了个天
Jesus Christ.

607
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,180
这就是电脑的精髓
That's the thing about computers.

608
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,310
你想删除什么都行
You can delete whatever you want,

609
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,440
但数据永远不会真正消失
but it's never really gone.

610
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,080
如果你没做最后那次交易
So, if you had just stopped one trade sooner,

611
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,880
他们可能永远抓不到你
they might never have even caught you.

612
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,730
没错  我本可以最后三四五次交易都不做
Yeah, I could've stopped five, four, three trades sooner.

613
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,880
都不会抓到我  但你怎么知道什么时候停手
They might not have. But how do you know?

614
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,050
我告诉你什么时候停手
I'll tell you how you know.

615
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,140
当你有了足够的钱
You stop when you have enough money

616
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,440
送你孩子读完大学的时候
to put your kids through college.

617
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,020
是  但读什么样的大学
Yeah, but what college?

618
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,010
如果他们想读医学院呢
And what if they want to go to med school?

619
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,780
如果他们想要一辆车呢
And what if they need a car?

620
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,530
就这样想着想着
And then somewhere along the way,

621
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,380
你不再考虑他们是否需要车
you stop thinking about if they need a car,

622
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,450
转而开始考虑"我需要一辆车"
and you start thinking, "I need a car."

623
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,470
就在这时你被抓了
And that's when you get caught,

624
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,080
因为不管你是否承认
because whether you want to admit it to yourself or not,

625
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,740
你从没在第一时间考虑到他们
you were never thinking about them in first place.

626
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,710
不管你是否考虑到了
And whether you were or weren't,

627
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,040
一旦你开始  便难以收手
once you start, you don't stop.

628
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,090
这真是个精彩的故事  弗兰克
That's one hell of a story, Frank.

629
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,110
是啊  这是监狱
Yeah, well, this is prison.

630
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,170
每人都有个精彩的故事
Everyone's got a hell of a story.

631
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:34,410
行了  今晚先讲这个故事
Anyway, that's enough for one night.

632
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,080
我要睡觉了
I'm gonna go to bed.

633
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,560
我的故事是源于我奶奶
My story started with my grandmother.

634
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,110
她病了
She was sick,

635
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,070
需要钱
and she needed money...

636
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,930
我找了个办法挣钱给她治病
and I found a way to get it for her.

637
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,500
我了个去
Holy shit.

638
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,490
这玩意简直棒呆了
This is the best thing ever.

639
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,360
我爱死你俩了
I love the both of you so much.

640
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,090
-看你干的好事  -哈维  我们要成功了
- This is your doing. - Harvey, we're making progress.

641
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,480
天哪  这是我吃过的最好吃的蛋卷
Holy shit. This is the best egg roll ever.

642
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,060
老天爷  我要离开这里
Jesus Christ, get me out of here.

643
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,430
真是太爽了
This is so awesome.

644
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,020
自从我得了奥林匹克数学竞赛冠军
I mean, I haven't been this stress-free

645
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,560
并且埃斯特去了减肥夏令营的那一周之后
since I took gold in the Math-lympics

646
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,280
我从没有这么放松过
and Esther went to fat camp in the same week.

647
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,630
埃斯特去过减肥夏令营
Esther went to fat camp?

648
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,070
他们管那个叫小提琴全明星夏令营
They called it Violin All-Stars,

649
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,580
但我们都知道它的真正意思
but we all know what that's code for.

650
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,990
如果你想象她穿着女生校服的样子
And if you so much as picture her in a school-girl outfit.

651
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,870
拜托  路易  我们都觉得挺好的
Come on, Louis, we're all feeling good.

652
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,250
难道你想给我说你从来没有不小心
You telling me you never slipped up

653
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,670
掉进一段不恰当的关系吗
and had an inappropriate relationship?

654
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,870
-路易  我不想知道答案  -有过
- Louis, I do not want to know the answer to that. - I did.

655
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,830
那是我人生中最丢脸的一晚
It was the most shameful night of my life.

656
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,170
-哈维  别问  -你为什么丢脸
- Harvey, don't-- - What exactly was so shameful about it?

657
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,570
她是个律师助理
Well, she was a paralegal,

658
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,880
我和她一起洗泥浴了
and I took mud with her.

659
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,830
我不懂
I don't understand.

660
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,430
你是说你玷污了她的名声
Are you saying you sullied her reputation?

661
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,740
不  我是说我玷污了泥浴
No, I'm saying I sullied the concept of mud.

662
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,840
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

663
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,110
怎么  我需要用扩音器吗
What, do I need a bullhorn?

664
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,630
我做了一次草率的泥浴
I had a premature muddification.

665
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,610
这是什么鬼意思
What the hell does that mean?

666
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,920
我想我们都明白他的意思了
I think we all know what that means.

667
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,280
意思是我在泥里没克制住激情
It means I couldn't hold my mud.

668
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,260
我还是不懂到底什么意思
I still don't know what that means.

669
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,180
你在泥浴里上大号了
Did you take a shit in the mud?

670
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,160
没有  这太恶心了
No, that's disgusting.

671
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,530
好吧  这个对话有不恶心人的部分吗
Well, what part of this conversation isn't disgusting?

672
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,580
我知道我会后悔问这个的
I know I'm gonna regret asking this.

673
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,160
到底是谁
Who exactly was it?

674
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,560
我不能告诉你
I cannot tell you that information.

675
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,820
那太好了  因为事实上我不...
Okay, good, because the truth is, I don't--

676
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,970
是米西・迪特勒
It was Missy Dietler.

677
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,950
路易  我要问你个问题
Louis, I'm gonna ask you a question.

678
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,640
希望你如实回答
I want you to tell me the truth.

679
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,570
米西・迪特勒知道你没克制住自己吗
Does Missy Dietler know you couldn't hold your mud?

680
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,550
当然不知道
Oh, heavens no.

681
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,650
那个土耳其泥浆厚到
The Turkish silt was thick enough

682
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,270
让她不会感觉到...
to prevent her from feeling it, so...

683
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,280
厚到能掩盖你射完就睡觉吗
Was it thick enough to hide you wanting to go sleep after?

684
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,710
天哪  她知道了
My God, she knew.

685
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,230
我得告诉你  路易  他们都知道
I got news for you, Louis. They always know.

686
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,080
你说的太对了
Oh, you're so right.

687
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,050
真是太对了
You're so right.

688
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,170
她
She--

689
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,930
我需要一刻钟静一静
I need 15 minutes to myself.

690
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,020
就这样
And that's it.

691
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,490
我做了个交易  然后我就到这了
I cut a deal, and now I'm here.

692
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,360
等等
Wait a second.

693
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,190
如果你是个冒牌律师  他们肯定给过你机会
If you're a fake lawyer, they had to give you a chance

694
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,350
把其他人抖出来这样你就不用坐牢了
to turn on someone to get out of it.

695
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,550
他们给了
They did.

696
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,360
所以为什么你没有这样做
So why the hell didn't you do it?

697
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,470
因为这样做的话我的良心会过不去
Because I wouldn't have been able to live with myself.

698
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,120
那外面可有人欠你一个大人情
Somebody out there owes you a lot.

699
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,530
没错
Yeah, well...

700
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,550
但我也欠他很多
I owe him a lot too.

701
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,890
所以
So, what, you're--

702
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,900
你是个好人还是
you're like a-a good guy or something?

703
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,580
我是吗
Am I?

704
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,860
你什么意思
What do you mean?

705
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,390
我今天在圣坛抛下了我爱的女人
I left the woman I love at the altar today.

706
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,420
你为什么这样做
Why'd you do that?

707
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,140
因为我不想让她以后后悔
Because I didn't want to chain her to me

708
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,690
现在留在我身边
if there was even the chance that she would regret it.

709
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,010
没错  你就是个好人
Then, yeah, you're a good guy.

710
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,510
谢谢你  弗兰克
Thanks, Frank.

711
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,040
大家都走了的好处之一就是
One thing about everyone being gone...

712
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,060
我们可以在里这想干嘛就干嘛
we got the run of the place.

713
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,890
我从来不知道这里的天花板是这样的
I never knew what the ceiling looked like in here.

714
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,290
我们好像《早餐俱乐部》一样
It's like "The Breakfast Club."

715
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,200
你有过不引用电影的时候吗
Do you ever not quote a movie?

716
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,400
没有  如果你对此有意见的话  亲爱的
No, and you got a problem with that, frankly, my dear,

717
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,680
我一点都不在乎
I don't give a damn.

718
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,070
你就是个笨蛋
You're an idiot.

719
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,580
你觉得路易和我会和好吗
You think Louis is gonna be okay with me now?

720
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,470
我想我们马上就能知道了
I think we're about to find out.

721
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,660
哈维  有关之前我说的
Harvey, what I was saying before...

722
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,140
路易  你不需要说任何话
You don't need to say anything, Louis.

723
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,050
我不会把它告诉任何人的
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

724
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,230
这不是我要说的
That's not what I was gonna say.

725
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,740
那不是唯一的我有过的不恰当关系
It's not the only inappropriate relationship I ever had.

726
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,540
我把你说知道迈克没去过法学院录了下来
I recorded you saying that you knew about Mike,

727
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,390
而且我差点把录音给了安妮塔・吉布斯
and I almost gave it to Anita Gibbs.

728
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,410
-你知道这件事吗  -不知道
- Did you know about this? - No.

729
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,980
但当他试图拉我一起把你交给吉布斯时
But I suspected when he tried to get me

730
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,960
我就有所怀疑了
to turn you in to Gibbs with him.

731
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,150
你是怎么样回复他的要求的
And what exactly was your response to that request?

732
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,270
她说我们没有必要这样做
She said we didn't need to do that,

733
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,220
如果真的到了那一步
and if it came to it,

734
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,860
你会替我们两个顶罪的
you would take the bullet for both of us.

735
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,500
-我会的  -哈维  我很抱歉
- I would have. - I'm sorry, Harvey.

736
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,900
我差点毁了你的生活
I almost ruined your life.

737
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,790
你不需要道歉  路易
You don't need to be sorry, Louis.

738
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,980
事实上是  当我决定录用迈克时
The truth is, I'm the one that ruined all of our lives,

739
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,350
我就成了那个毁了我们生活的人
when I hired Mike.

740
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,440
而且我从未对此向你们道歉
And I never apologized to either one of you for it,

741
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,710
但我现在会了
but I will now.

742
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,860
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

743
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,120
所以
So...

744
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,080
我们和好了吗
we good?

745
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,970
我们和好了
We're good.

746
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,120
很好  现在既然你们两人已经和好了
All right, now that the two of you have made peace,

747
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,230
让我们想想该如何打赢这场战争
let's figure out how we're gonna win this war,

748
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,980
就从弄清楚我们有多少战争资金开始
which starts with knowing how much we have in our war chest.

749
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,410
这是什么意思
What exactly does that mean?

750
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,020
意思是  现在是回答
It means it's time

751
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,590
她两小时前问的问题的时候了
to answer the question that she asked two hours ago.

752
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,990
我们到底有多少钱
How much money do we have?

753
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,780
又是这个问题
This again?

754
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,770
路易  今晚经历了这么多事之后
Louis, after everything we've been through tonight,

755
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,450
写下我们各自有多少钱
how hard could it be for us to write down

756
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,100
能有多难呢
how much we're worth right now?

757
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,240
再给我一刻钟静一静
I need another 15 minutes to myself.

758
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,730
-又来  -哈维  让他去吧
- Again? - Aw, Harvey, let him go.

759
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,950
他可能没有我们有钱
He probably doesn't have as much as we do,

760
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,710
这会让他感觉自己很脆弱
and it's a vulnerable thing for him.

761
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,960
很脆弱
"Vulnerable"?

762
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,650
他刚刚才告诉我们他在泥巴里打飞机
He just told us he jerked off in the mud an hour ago.

763
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,690
你不会认为他现在就在那么做吧
You don't think he's gonna do that right now, do you?

764
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,570
根据他告诉我们的
Based on what he told us,

765
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,580
他用不了一刻钟
he doesn't need 15 minutes for that.

766
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,530
你想打电话给她吗
You want to call her?

767
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,040
什么
What?

768
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,360
你的未婚妻  你想打给她吗
Your fiancée, you want to call her?

769
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,970
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

770
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,300
我是说我来这儿第一夜时
I'm talking about my first night in here.

771
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,010
我记得当时满脑子想的都是
I remember thinking what I wouldn't give

772
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,290
只要能告诉詹妮弗我很好  我什么都愿意做
to let Jennifer know I was okay.

773
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,930
事情是  我当时不行  但你现在可以
The thing is, I couldn't, but you can.

774
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,080
我以为我们在这不能有手机
I thought we weren't allowed to have phones in here.

775
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,610
嗯  我之前还不被允许做内幕交易呢
Yeah, well, I wasn't allowed to make inside trades either.

776
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,160
但我做了  现在我在监狱里
But I did, and now I'm in here.

777
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,730
他们还能拿我怎么办
What else are they gonna do?

778
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,660
谢谢  但是
Uh, thanks, but...

779
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,020
我只是
I just...

780
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,740
我现在还不能
I just can't right now.

781
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,820
你什么时候想打了  手机就在这
Whenever you want, phone's right here.

782
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,180
试着睡一下吧
Let's try to get some shut-eye, man.

783
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,230
你还好吗
You okay?

784
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,670
到处都是他
He's everywhere.

785
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,640
到处都有他的影子  唐娜
He's all around here, Donna.

786
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,470
我们第一次见面的地方在公司的过道
The first place we met was down the hallway.

787
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,850
我们第一次接吻的地方是在图书馆
And the first time we kissed was in the library.

788
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,980
我在离这50英尺的地方见了他的祖母
And I met his grandmother 50 feet from here.

789
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,990
就在这  他把一切都告诉我了
And right here, he told me the truth.

790
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,740
-瑞秋  -他就站在
- Rachel-- - He was standing

791
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,900
你现在的位置  我当时对他很生气
right where you are, and I was upset with him

792
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,040
为什么我自己都不记得了
about something that I don't even remember.

793
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,970
然后他跟我说他失去了一切
And then he told me that he had lost everyone in his life,

794
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,180
还告诉我他是个冒牌货
and then he told me he was a fraud.

795
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,920
然后我们...
And then we... Mm.

796
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,270
-你会撑过去的  -我知道
- You're gonna get through this. - I know.

797
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,310
我只希望我能见到他
I just wish I could see him.

798
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,860
什么意思  你可以见他啊
What do you mean? You can see him.

799
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,930
我不行  我给监狱打了电话
No, I can't. I called the prison.

800
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,810
你今晚给监狱打了电话
You called the prison tonight?

801
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,850
是的  我想知道他是不是还好
Yes, because I wanted to know if he was okay.

802
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,730
可他们...
And they...

803
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,580
他们什么信息都不给我
they wouldn't give me any information.

804
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,570
我就问了探视的事
So then I asked them about visitation,

805
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,920
可他们说我得等
and they said that I had to wait,

806
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,630
我得进一个名单里  然后...
and I had to get on a list, and--

807
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,650
要多久
How long?

808
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,710
至少一个月
At least a month.

809
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,300
我不知道能说什么
I don't know what to say.

810
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,690
你总是知道该说什么的
You always know what to say.

811
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,930
这次真不知道
Not this time.

812
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,280
抱歉  女士们
Excuse me, ladies.

813
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,880
很抱歉打扰了  但我觉得我们有麻烦
Sorry to interrupt, but I think we might have a problem.

814
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,980
-怎么了  本杰明  -我们被黑客攻击了
- What is it, Benjamin? - We're being hacked.

815
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,210
你写了个很不错的数额嘛
Oh, that's a tidy little sum you got there.

816
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,820
你也不错啊
You're not doing so bad yourself.

817
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,210
是啊  我是不错
No, I am not.

818
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,020
对于两个一无所有的人来说是不错
Not bad for two people that came from nothing.

819
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,430
我不是一无所有  你知道
I didn't come from nothing, and you know it.

820
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,110
写下那个数字肯定感觉还是很不错
Bet it still feels pretty good to write that number down.

821
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,190
那是当然了
Oh, it sure does.

822
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,290
你还有点嗨呢  是吗
You're still a little high, aren't you?

823
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,610
当然
I sure am.

824
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,690
好了  你们想知道我的净资产
There. You wanted you wanted to know my net worth.

825
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,630
就是这个了
You got it.

826
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,190
-天呐  -你是谁啊
- Holy shit. - Who are you?

827
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,320
-你是国王吗  -不  我只是不傻
- Are you a king? - No, I'm just not an idiot.

828
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,580
你们都拿钱干什么了
What the hell have you been doing with your money?

829
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,080
路易  我们也不是穷人
Louis, we're not exactly poor.

830
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,370
那是玻利维亚跟英国说的话
That's what Bolivia says to the U.S.,

831
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,500
可一旦北约开战  他们完全没用
but if NATO goes to war, they're not kicking in dick.

832
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,680
如果你这么有钱
Well, if you're so damn rich, why didn't you pony up

833
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
当初有机会的时候为什么不付唐娜的工资
for Donna's salary when you had the chance?

834
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,200
你知道"财务责任"这个词怎么拼吗
Do you even know how to spell "Fiscal responsibility"?

835
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,320
我知道怎么拼"小气"
I know how to spell "Cheap."

836
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,860
好了  够了
All right, that's enough.

837
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,580
至少现在我们知道
At least now we know

838
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,680
我们有足够的钱来支持一阵了
we have enough to fund ourselves for a while.

839
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,270
你俩有有钱叔叔吗
You guys have two rich uncles?

840
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,840
因为如果这律所倒了  我是不会支撑你俩的
'Cause I'm not carrying your asses if this thing drags out.

841
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,590
路易  这是团队合作  而且我对上帝发誓
Louis, this is a team effort, and I swear to God,

842
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,870
如果你不帮我们
if you don't come through on this--

843
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,340
我不愿打扰你们的"早餐俱乐部"活动
I hate to interrupt your "Breakfast Club" Moment,

844
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,610
但你们得清醒一下
but you need to sober up.

845
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,260
-唐娜  怎么了  -据本杰明说
- Donna, what is it? - According to Benjamin,

846
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,960
合伙人们不光是走了
the partners didn't just leave.

847
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,160
他们还在挖我们所有客户墙角
They're coming after every client we have.

848
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,120
好  告诉我最新情况
All right, give me an update

849
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,350
用最简单的英语
and give it to me in plain English.

850
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,440
我找到了办法中断了黑客攻击
I was able to shut the hack down,

851
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,560
但没能赶在他们拿到三个你们的客户资料之前
but not before they got all three of your clients' files.

852
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,250
该死  他们要今晚就搞垮我们
Shit, they're trying to put us in the ground tonight.

853
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,290
那我们要在这事开始之前就阻止他们
Then we have to stop it before it even gets started.

854
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,040
唯一的问题是
Well, the only problem with that

855
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,390
我们不知道他们现在在外面
is that we don't know what bullshit story

856
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,510
到处宣扬什么说法
they're out there selling right now.

857
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,470
那我们得想办法知道  还得快
Then we need to figure it out. We need to figure it out fast.

858
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,330
是主线
It's the main line.

859
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,270
我们怎么办
What should we do?

860
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,720
唐娜
Donna.

861
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,090
皮-斯-利律所  有什么可以帮您
Pearson Specter Litt, may I help you?

862
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,020
请稍等
One moment, please.

863
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,530
找你的  吉姆・雷诺兹
It's for you. It's Jim Reynolds.

864
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,590
是德克尔制药  别接  他要离开
That's Decker Pharmaceutical. Don't take it. He's leaving us.

865
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,650
路易  他是我最老的客户
Louis, he's my oldest client.

866
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,760
我不能躲他的电话
I'm not ducking his call.

867
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,450
-杰西卡  -开免提
- Jessica. - Put him on speaker.

868
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,670
吉姆  有什么要我帮忙吗
Jim, how can I help you?

869
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,360
你可以跟我说说到底什么情况
You can tell me what's going on there.

870
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,520
我听说了很多流言
I've been hearing a lot of rumors,

871
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,480
我需要听你说实话
and I need to hear the truth from you.

872
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,130
好的吉姆  你想听事实是吗
All right, Jim, you want to hear the truth?

873
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,730
我们下午出去了一趟  回来的时候
We went out for the afternoon, and when we got back,

874
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,660
所有合伙人都不见了
every partner in the place was gone.

875
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,120
但我跟你说
But I'm telling you,

876
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,900
冠名合伙人还都在
the name partners are still here,

877
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,540
而我们依然可以为你和董事会服务
and we can still service you and the board.

878
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,790
我知道你可以
I know you can.

879
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,720
那你打来不是跟我们说要走的吗
Then you're not calling to say that you're leaving us?

880
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,990
我来告诉你  我收到了通告
I was calling to tell you I've been sent notice.

881
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,170
他们在拆解你的律所
They're bifurcating your firm,

882
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,950
而其他合伙人跟皮-斯-利律所
and the other partners have nothing to do

883
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,980
再没有关系了
with Pearson Specter Litt anymore.

884
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,450
谢谢  吉姆  我跟感激  也不会忘记这份情
Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it, and I won't forget it.

885
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,910
杰西卡  如果你在月末时
Jessica, if you're not back on your feet

886
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,870
没能站稳脚跟
by the end of the month,

887
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,800
我就拦不住董事会了
I won't be able to hold off the board.

888
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,170
如果我们在月末时没能站稳脚跟
If we're not back by the end of the month,

889
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,190
我会亲自打给董事会引咎辞职
I will call the board and resign from service myself.

890
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,550
这不是好事吗  他们没想要趁机占便宜
Isn't this good? They're not trying to poach.

891
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,060
-是坏事  -什么意思
- It's just as bad. - What do you mean?

892
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,430
这意味着他们现在已经不在乎客户了
It means they don't care about clients right now.

893
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,330
他们在拆解律所
They're bifurcating the firm

894
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,590
是因为他们想拿回合伙人的买入金
because they want their buy-ins back.

895
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,260
他们黑进我们的电脑获取客户信息
And they hacked us to get our clients' information

896
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,990
这样他们就能发布通告
so that they could deliver notice.

897
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,430
我们得在明天之前转移
We need to move the money that we have

898
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,970
所有账户里的钱
in every account by tomorrow.

899
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,270
我们用不着转移  我们得利用它们
We don't need to move it. We need to use it.

900
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,490
如果你在想我认为你在想的事
If you're thinking what I think you're thinking,

901
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,010
那你真是天才
you're a genius.

902
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,170
你在说些什么
What are you talking about?

903
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,050
我们可以用他们的钱
We can use their buy-ins

904
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,950
和解公司所面临的集体诉讼
to settle the class-action lawsuits.

905
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,810
然后他们就不能要回所有的钱
And they won't be able to sue us for the money back

906
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,440
因为钱已经没了
because it'll already be gone.

907
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,760
你真的是个天才
You really are a genius.

908
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,260
谢谢  哈维
Thanks, Harvey.

909
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,290
我还是强调一下我才是那个
Uh, might I point out that I was the one

910
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,830
一开始让你们注意到公司系统
that brought the hacking to your attention

911
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,390
被黑这件事  所以...
in the first place, so...

912
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,570
还是告诉我你在想什么吧
You might as well tell me what's on your mind.

913
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,460
我在这里都可以感觉到
I can hear you staring at the wall

914
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,170
你一直盯着墙
from all the way over here.

915
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,010
你怎么解决的...
How do you handle it...

916
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,620
离开詹妮弗这么久
Being away from Jennifer for so long?

917
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,560
相信对方  探望对方
Trust each other, visit each other,

918
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,530
不问你不想知道答案的问题
and don't ask questions you don't want answers to.

919
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,950
听起来挺难的
That doesn't sound like fun.

920
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,720
不过对你来说应该没那么难吧
Yeah, well, it shouldn't be that hard for you.

921
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,800
你才进来待两年
You're only here for two years.

922
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,360
我还要待五年
I'm here for five more.

923
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,810
-天哪  -还用你说
- Jesus. - You're telling me.

924
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,380
也许我该给瑞秋发条短信
You know, maybe I'll just send Rachel a text...

925
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,360
让她知道我没事
you know, let her know that I'm okay.

926
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,900
当然的  孩子
Sure thing, kid.

927
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,580
发完了就还给我
Just give it back when you're done.

928
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,370
既然我们要重新开始
Well, now that we're starting fresh,

929
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,320
能不能把那副丑鸭画拿下来
can we please finally get rid of that hideous duck painting?

930
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,670
-不行  路易  -为什么不行
- No, Louis, we can't. - Why not?

931
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,970
因为它就像是你
Because it's like you.

932
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,120
虽然让人受不了  但终究是家人
I can't stand it, but it's part of the family.

933
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,770
说起家人  格蕾琴去哪了
Speaking of family, where's Gretchen?

934
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,990
我不敢相信她也抛下了我们
I can't believe she would walk out on us too.

935
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,940
她没有  本来今天我们要去参加婚礼
She didn't. We were supposed to be at the wedding,

936
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,980
所以我放她假让她去看正齿医生了
so I gave her the day off to go to the orthodontist.

937
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,640
-正齿医生吗  -是啊  她都60多了
- Orthodontist? - Yeah, the woman's in her 60s.

938
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,190
还带着牙套
She still wears a retainer.

939
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,420
好了  计划是这样
All right, we have a game plan.

940
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,560
明天早上我们
Tomorrow morning, we offer them

941
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,930
拿出十分之一的钱摆平集体诉讼
ten cents on the dollar to settle these suits.

942
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,590
从现在开始
And from this point on,

943
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,330
我们都要为了这个公司
we are all committing to giving this firm

944
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,610
拼尽全力
every ounce of blood, sweat, and tears we have.

945
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,970
什么
What is it?

946
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,860
我刚收到了一条迈克的短信
I just got a text from Mike.

947
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,320
怎么说的
What does it say?

948
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,250
他说他安顿了下来
It says that he's settling in

949
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,760
然后他和室友相处很融洽
and that he's getting along well with his roommate...

950
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,780
还有他说他会没事的
And that he thinks he's gonna be okay.

951
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,550
也许他是会没事
Maybe he's gonna be okay,

952
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,230
但他室友就有麻烦了
but his roommate's in for trouble.

953
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,290
敬麻烦
To trouble.

954
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:42,980
敬麻烦
To trouble.

955
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,980
什么
What?

956
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,910
她回你短信了
She texted you back.

957
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,400
她说什么
What did she say?

958
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,330
她说她收到了你的短信  她很想你
She says she got your text, she misses you,

959
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:05,000
还有她很高兴你和室友相处融洽
And she's glad you get along with your roomate.

960
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,330
谢谢你  弗兰克
Thanks, Frank.

961
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,000
谢谢你做的一切
For everthing.

962
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,100
好了  走吧
All right, let's go.

963
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,220
快  你得在下一班查房之前离开  
Come on, you got to get out before next shift.

964
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,530
换房的事不能让他们发现
They can't know I let you switch.

965
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,310
等等  换什么
Wait, switch what?

966
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,270
这就是我的牢房  你们给我的牢房
I'm in the right cell. I'm in the one you gave me.

967
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,820
是啊  但这不是他们给我的房间
Yeah, but this isn't the one they gave me.

968
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,060
什么
What?

969
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,070
这是你的房间  但不是我的
You're in the right cell. I'm not.

970
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,570
你到底在说些什么
What the hell are you talking about?

971
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,410
今晚我告诉你的唯一一件真事
Only thing I told you tonight that's true

972
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,580
是你不能相信这里的任何人
is that you shouldn't trust people in here.

973
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,590
但是你信了  现在我知道了你的一切
But you did. Now I know all about you.

974
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,120
你为何要这样做
Why the hell would you do that to me?

975
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,270
你说你本来你可以让另一个人进来的
You said you could've turned on a guy to get out of here

976
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,050
但是你没有因为你觉得自己亏欠他
but you didn't because you owe him.

977
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,730
好吧  我也欠那个够娘养的
Well, I owe that son of bitch too.

978
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,450
-哈维  -是啊  哈维・斯佩克特
- Harvey.  - Yeah, Harvy Specter.

979
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,510
13年前送我进了这里  
Put me away 13 years ago.

980
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,010
自那以后我做梦都想报复他
I've been dreaming about getting him back ever since.

981
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,190
然后我在报纸上看到了你
Then I read about you in the paper.

982
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,920
我意识到
I realized that

983
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,100
即使不出监狱我也可以报仇
I could get back at him without leaving these walls.

984
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,360
混蛋
You son of bitch.

985
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,710
放松  迈克
Get it easy, Mike.

986
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,610
记得我知道你的一切
You remember I know about you.

987
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,420
还有你女朋友的电话号码
And I get your little girlfriend's number right here.
