{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on "Suits"...

15
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,050
因为我已经追查萨特三年了
I've been after Sutter for three years now.

16
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,630
这个狡猾的混蛋
This guy's one slippery son of a bitch.

17
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,530
等等  威廉・萨特吗
Wait a second, William Sutter?

18
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,300
他上周来找过我让我为他辩护
He came to me a week ago to take him on.

19
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,050
你一旦做了任何威胁到我的事
You cross one line that puts me in jeopardy,

20
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,630
我就会把这件事叫停
I'm gonna pull the plug on this whole thing.

21
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,940
我需要在汉普顿买一栋又大又贵的房子
I need a large, expensive home in the Hamptons.

22
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,610
你为什么要买一栋度假住宅
Why are you buying a vacation home?

23
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,730
因为我告诉塔拉・梅瑟
Because I told Tara Messer

24
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,850
我在那里有一处房产
that I have a property out there,

25
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,270
而且我雇了她来重新装修
and I hired her to remodel it for me.

26
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,180
可恶  哈维  我不会在这个案子上和你串通
Damn it, Harvey, I'm not colluding on this,

27
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,460
你居然来这里
and you're in here trying to get me

28
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,270
怂恿我对你自己的客户提起公诉
to bring an indictment against your own client.

29
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,220
因为你提起公诉后  我会打赢官司
Because when you bring that indictment, I'm gonna beat it,

30
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,260
可你不起诉
and if you don't bring it,

31
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,950
且继续调查我的客户  我就会去告你
and continue investigating my client, I'm gonna sue you.

32
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,140
我觉得最可笑的是
I think it's pretty goddamn funny

33
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,510
你口口声声说你不信任我  但你才是那个
that you don't trust me, when you're the one

34
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,360
连进来的原因都不敢告诉我的人
that won't even tell me what you're in here for.

35
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,220
好  我接受
Okay. I'll do it.

36
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,950
-你说什么  -你的法律援助案件
- Excuse me? - Your pro bono.

37
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,570
明早带文件来
Bring me the file tomorrow morning.

38
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,100
你这招接得很漂亮  肖恩
It was a good fix, Sean.

39
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,850
你的招出得也不错  哈维
It was a good move, Harvey.

40
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,560
想去喝一杯吗
Want to get a drink?

41
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,630
不如就在这儿喝怎么样
Why don't we just have one here?

42
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,780
为什么  目前为止
Why? As of right now,

43
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,940
你还没有针对我客户的动作
you have no action pending against my client.

44
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,150
但明早就有了
But as of tomorrow, I do,

45
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,700
因为明早起诉书就要提出了
'cause those indictments are coming down in the morning.

46
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,100
凯文  你做了什么
Kevin, what did you do?

47
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,340
我跟妻子吵了一架
I got in a fight with my wife.

48
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,120
我喝醉了  开着车  差点撞死人
I got drunk. I got into my car, and I almost killed someone.

49
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,800
我错过了上千次早晨抱抱我的孩子的机会
I'm missing 1,000 chances to hug my kids in the morning

50
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,570
晚上亲吻我妻子的机会
and kiss my wife good night,

51
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,570
只是因为我没有控制好自己
all because I couldn't control myself.

52
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,450
你跟你妻子是因为什么吵的架
What were you fighting with your wife about?

53
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,160
我不能说  不能说
I can't. I just can't.

54
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,640
哈维  你在这干什么
Harvey. What are you doing here?

55
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,810
迈克  坐下  我得跟你说件事
Mike, sit down. I need to tell you something.

56
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,240
怎么了
What's going on?

57
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,560
我在想办法把你弄出去
I'm working on getting you out of here.

58
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,160
对  我知道
Yeah, I know you are.

59
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,090
我不是指为卡荷尔做的事
I'm not talking about what we're doing for Cahill.

60
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,990
我是说别的
I'm talking about something else.

61
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,420
哈维  这里这么多人
Harvey, we're in a room full of people.

62
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,820
你不能在这提卡荷尔
You can't be talking about Cahill.

63
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,940
如果凯文知道了
If Kevin finds out--

64
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,590
他现在知道也无所谓了
It doesn't matter if Kevin finds out now.

65
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,650
他完了
He's done.

66
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,310
你说他完了是什么意思
What do you mean, "He's done?"

67
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,700
瑞秋死了
I mean Rachel's dead...

68
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,470
是凯文杀了她
and Kevin killed her.

69
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,690
什么
What?

70
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,450
是真的
It's true.

71
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,970
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

72
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,090
你在骗我
You're lying to me.

73
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,110
该死  他跟你说了是他干的
Goddamn it. He told you he did it.

74
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,230
-放屁  -他喝醉了
- Bullshit. - He got drunk.

75
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,880
开着车
He got in a car.

76
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,890
撞死了你爱的女人
He murdered the woman you love.

77
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,770
-别说了  -而你下半辈子
- Stop saying that. - And now you're going

78
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,180
就要跟他一起困在这里了
to be stuck in here with him for the rest of your life.

79
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,980
别说了  凯文不会那么对我的
Stop it. Kevin would never do that to me.

80
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,400
-迈克  醒醒吧  -不
- Mike, wake up. - No.

81
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,180
-迈克  -不
- Mike. - No.

82
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,740
-醒醒  醒醒  -不
- Wake up. Wake up. - No!

83
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,480
-迈克  醒醒  -不不不
- Mike, wake up. - No, no, no, no, no.

84
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,670
迈克  醒醒
Mike, wake up.

85
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,330
你没事吧
Hey, you okay?

86
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,420
-没事  我没事  -你确定
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. - You sure?

87
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,930
你好像做了个很可怕的梦
'Cause that was some dream you were having.

88
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,040
我没事
I'm fine.

89
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,430
我接着睡了
Just going back to sleep.

90
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,130
哈维  太好了  你来了
Harvey, good, there you are.

91
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,500
-怎么了  -萨特刚刚打来
- What's going on? - Sutter just called.

92
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,160
让我猜猜  起诉书出来了吧
Let me guess, the indictments came down?

93
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,810
他一小时之前就要你去他办公室了
He wants you in his office an hour ago.

94
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,920
我去跟他说你在路上了
I'll tell him you're on your way.

95
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,210
不  跟他说你找不到我
No. Tell him you couldn't reach me.

96
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,700
你要他紧张  但是为什么
You want him to start sweating, but why?

97
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,140
因为人一紧张
Because when people start sweating,

98
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,190
就会开始跟他的律师说实话
they start talking to their lawyer.

99
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,010
我让雷去待命
I'll tell Ray to be on hold.

100
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,700
不  让他把车开过来
No, tell him to pull around.

101
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,400
你不是说你不去萨特那边吗
But you just said you weren't going to Sutter's.

102
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,500
的确  我要去别的地方
I'm not. I'm going somewhere else.

103
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,250
看看谁来了  大明星啊
Oh, look who it is, the man of the hour.

104
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,580
-你收到我的起诉书了吗  -当然收到了
- Did you get my indictments? - I sure as hell did.

105
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,560
既然派对已经开始了
Now that the party's started,

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,360
你告诉我凯文・米勒知道些什么吧
why don't you tell me what Kevin Miller knows?

107
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,760
-你在说什么  -你咬定这个人
- What are you talking about? - You went after the guy

108
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,270
想要他出卖萨特
to try to get him to flip on Sutter,

109
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,790
你觉得他能给你什么证据
so what'd you think he was gonna give you?

110
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,470
-我才不会告诉你  -为什么
- I'm not gonna tell you that. - Why not?

111
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,130
因为我一开始就跟你说了
Because I told you when I started this thing,

112
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,320
-我不会跟你串通的  -我们这不是串通
- I'm not gonna collude. - We're not colluding.

113
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,680
这叫发现
It's called discovery.

114
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,600
你赶快告诉我  凯文・米勒到底知道些什么
So why don't you tell me what the hell Kevin Miller knows?

115
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,660
凯文设计了一个交易软件
He developed the trading programs

116
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,810
萨特声称是靠那个软件获得了高额回报
that Sutter claims to use to get his superior returns.

117
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,490
那这个软件肯定没什么用
Then that program's got to be full of shit,

118
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,020
不然的话
because if it isn't--

119
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,410
萨特就没有做内部交易
Then Sutter's not inside trading,

120
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,630
而他绝对是做了内部交易
which he sure as shit is.

121
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,450
所以你想要凯文作证
So you're looking to have Kevin testify

122
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,970
那个软件是狗屁  而萨特也是知情的
that software is bullshit, and Sutter knows it.

123
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,770
-没错  -那让我问你
- Bingo. - Then let me ask you this,

124
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,040
你是以什么罪名把凯文抓进去的
what exactly did you put Kevin away for?

125
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,220
你又是为什么要知道答案
And why do you need to know that?

126
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,640
因为这也许可以帮我们弄清楚
Because it might help us figure out

127
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,290
他的弱点是什么
what his weak spot is.

128
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,570
我们给他的罪名是
We got him on vehicular assault while

129
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,550
醉驾撞人
driving under the influence.

130
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,340
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

131
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,300
你之前怎么没想着告诉我们一声
Why didn't you think to tell us that?

132
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,590
我为什么要说
Why would I?

133
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,860
迈克的父母就是被一个醉酒的司机撞死的
Mike's parents were killed by a drunk driver.

134
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,380
我怎么可能知道这一点
And how the hell was I supposed to know that?

135
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,690
我不知道  要是你能在
I don't know. It would have been nice

136
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,980
我们把迈克送回去和他同住之前
to know what this asshole did,

137
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,350
知会我们一声这个混蛋做了什么就好了
before we sent Mike back into a cell with him.

138
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,220
你今早怎么了
Hey, what happened to you this morning?

139
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,380
什么意思
What do you mean?

140
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,710
-你没去吃早餐  -我不饿
- You skipped breakfast. - I wasn't hungry.

141
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,410
-只是因为这个吗  -你想说什么
- That all it was? - What are you talking about?

142
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,440
拜托  迈克  你昨晚做了个噩梦
Come on, Mike, you had a nightmare last night.

143
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,900
然后今早一直在回避我
You've been avoiding me all morning,

144
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,720
现在又表现得很怪异  到底怎么了
and you're acting weird right now--what's going on?

145
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,910
没什么
Nothing's going on.

146
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,610
那你到底为什么吓出了一身冷汗
Then why the hell were you in a cold sweat,

147
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,680
咕哝着什么有人没发现
muttering something about someone not finding out,

148
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,320
然后还喊了我的名字
and then calling out my name?

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,660
好吧凯文  你想知道这是怎么回事是吧
All right, Kevin, you want to know what's going on?

150
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,680
我梦见你撞死了瑞秋
I had a dream that you killed Rachel in a car accident.

151
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,580
那也许就是今早
That's probably why I don't particularly

152
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,450
我不太想理你的原因
feel like hanging out with you this morning.

153
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,980
是因为你和我讲过的你父母的事
Because of what you told me about your parents,

154
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,110
-迈克 我真的很抱歉  -真的吗
- Mike, I'm really sorry. - Are you?

155
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,230
这是什么意思
What--what's that supposed to mean?

156
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,920
昨晚你告诉我你差点撞死了一个人
I mean, last night you told me you almost killed someone.

157
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,650
你对此感到抱歉吗  
Are you sorry about that?

158
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,450
你在说笑吗
You got to be kidding me.

159
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,900
你做了个梦  然后就来质问我
You have a dream, and now you're questioning

160
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,600
我是否为那晚的事感到抱歉
if I feel bad about what I did that night?

161
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,480
你还没回答我你是否感到抱歉
You still haven't answered whether or not you do.

162
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,710
知道吗  假如你需要冲我发火
You know what? You need to be pissed off

163
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,780
来调节心情  没问题
at me to deal with your shit, you go right ahead.

164
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,710
但我对那晚发生的事感到无比的悔恨
But I feel horrible about what happened that night,

165
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,470
而且我告诉你
and for your information,

166
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,370
我撞的那个人如今已经痊愈了
the guy that I hit is fully recovered right now,

167
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,710
而我却依然在这里赎罪
and I'm still in here paying for this shit.

168
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,280
准备开香槟庆祝吧  路易
Break out the champagne, Louis.

169
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,280
汉普顿的房子九十天之后就是你的了
That house in the Hamptons is gonna be yours into 90 days.

170
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,120
-他们接受我的报价了  -没错
- They accepted my offer? - That they did.

171
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,260
我有比香槟更好的庆祝方式...
Well, then I have something much better than champagne...

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,600
木材
Wood.

173
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,620
我真看不出来这怎么就比香槟好了
I don't really see how that's better than champagne.

174
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,810
你当然看不出来
Of course you don't.

175
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,440
因为你不知道我正在为塔拉
Because you don't know that I'm having a replica

176
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,850
搭建一个我房子的模型
of my house made for Tara,

177
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,800
这样她就能看见自己的设计成真了
so she can see her designs come to life.

178
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,610
路易  这一招真甜啊
Louis, that's actually really sweet.

179
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,370
我知道
I know.

180
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,680
现在  我只需要选择完美的木材
Now, all I need to do is pick the perfect wood.

181
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,420
我没明白
I don't follow.

182
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,900
唐娜  你所选择的木材
Donna, the kind of wood you get

183
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,080
能完全展示出
says everything you need to know

184
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,060
你是一个什么样的男人
about what kind of man you are.

185
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,640
是软还是硬
How hard or soft it is.

186
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,970
使用的时候能弯曲到什么程度
How much it bends when you're working it.

187
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,670
以及它是如何的坚定...
How firm it is compared--

188
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,530
我明白了  路易
I got the picture, Louis.

189
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,770
不  我觉得你没明白
No, I don't think you do.

190
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,290
让塔拉爱上我的木材
Making Tara love my wood

191
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,960
是让她爱上我的第一步
is the first step toward making her love me.

192
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,690
-好了  路易  冷静点  -不
- Okay, Louis, calm down. - No.

193
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,630
我并不想冷静下来
I don't really want to calm down,

194
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,150
因为我满脑子都是我的木材
because all I can think about my wood.

195
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,380
那告诉我
So tell me,

196
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,560
你一天之中
exactly how many different kinds of wood

197
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
看了多少种不同的木材
have you sampled in your day?

198
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,540
所有品种
All of them.

199
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,580
红木  栗木  胡桃木  各种木
Mahogany, chestnut, walnut, all the nuts.

200
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,350
乌木呢
Ebony?

201
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,760
别给我起乌木这个头
Don't even get me started on ebony.

202
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,440
当我看见乌木时
When I see ebony,

203
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,600
我只想抚摸它
all I want to do is put my hands all over it.

204
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,790
-老天  -我想住在里面
- Oh, God. - I want to live in it.

205
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,600
我想拍它  打它  摩擦它
I want to smack it and hit it, rub it down.

206
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,790
我真想吃了它
I just want to eat it.

207
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,370
有什么好笑的
What's so funny?

208
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,900
没什么...
Nothing. Um...

209
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,580
我只是觉得一个男人应该遵从自己的内心
I just think that a man needs to follow his heart

210
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,100
选择他感觉对的那种木材
and choose the wood that just feels right.

211
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,400
-感觉对的  -没错
- Feels right. - Yeah.

212
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,040
正是如此  唐娜...
That's it. Donna...

213
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,550
我需要你帮我感受我的木材
I need you to help me feel my wood.

214
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,790
老天爷啊
Oh, dear God.

215
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,200
该死的  朱莉
God damn it, Julie,

216
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,350
再给他办公室打一次电话
call his office again,

217
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,610
这次告诉他去找...
and this time tell him to find--

218
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,040
假如你说的是我的办公室
If you're talking about my office,

219
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,860
那就不必打电话了
there's no need.

220
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,500
我来了
I'm right here.

221
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,580
你怎么现在才来
What the hell took you so long?

222
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,900
-我之前没空  -我刚刚被起诉了
- I was unavailable. - Well, I just got indicted,

223
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,750
所以从现在开始  你必须有空
so from now on you make yourself available.

224
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,820
我明白了
I get it.

225
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,600
你刚开始觉得这不是玩笑
This all just got real for you,

226
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,930
所以你现在何不告诉我
so why don't you tell me right now,

227
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,100
其他部分有多真实
how real is the rest of it?

228
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,820
你在说什么
What are you saying?

229
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,390
我在说  卡荷尔声称
I'm saying, Cahill claims

230
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,920
你是赚不到你所赚的利润的
that you can't make the returns you do.

231
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,890
而你说你可以
You say you can,

232
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,130
所以我想知道你是怎么赚到的
and I want to know how you do it.

233
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,360
我们使用了一个自营交易算法
We use a proprietary trading algorithm.

234
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,930
-由谁开发的  -我的女婿
- Developed by who? - My son-in-law.

235
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,160
很好  那我们就可以把这个算法给卡荷尔了
Good, then we can give it to Cahill,

236
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,280
因为他刚刚申请到了传票
'cause he just subpoenaed it.

237
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,330
-不  我们不能给  -为什么
- No, we can't. - Why the hell not?

238
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,250
因为我赚钱最多的那些交易
Because the trades on which I make the most money

239
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,840
和那个程序无关
have nothing to do with that program.

240
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,000
你开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

241
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,040
你在承认自己有内线交易
You're admitting to inside trading?

242
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,950
我什么都没承认  只是有些时候
I'm not admitting to anything, except that sometimes

243
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,300
我的交易靠的是直觉
I trade with my gut.

244
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,090
那么威廉  我要告诉你
Well, I got news for you, William.

245
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,270
你这话在陪审团听来  会觉得你有罪
To a jury, that's gonna sound like you're full of shit.

246
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,390
那好  聪明人  拿起那份报纸
Okay, smart guy, pick up that journal.

247
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,410
说出一支股票的名字
Give me a stock.

248
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,470
纳斯达克  纽约证交所  什么都行
NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange, I don't give a shit.

249
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,560
随便选一个
Just pick one.

250
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,750
-骏科网络讯息  -骏科网络讯息
- All right, Computech. - Computech.

251
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,070
流通股票15.9亿股
1.59 billion shares outstanding.

252
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,040
昨日收盘于32  比较平稳
Yesterday's close, 32, flat.

253
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,920
今日开盘于33.25
Today's opening, 33 1/4.

254
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,260
市盈率17%
P/E's at 17.

255
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,550
年利润有望增长2%
Earnings expected to grow at 2% a year.

256
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,710
报纸上没说的是
What it doesn't say in there,

257
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,160
公司的利润不会增长
is that the earnings aren't gonna grow,

258
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,800
因为他们的首席执行官并不在乎
because the CEO doesn't give a shit,

259
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,340
这使得这个陷阱充满了迷惑性
which makes it a value trap dressed up like a princess,

260
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,550
我可不会去踩这样的无底洞
and I wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole.

261
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,010
你这伎俩很高超  威廉
That's a pretty neat trick, William,

262
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,260
但传票该来还是会来的
but it isn't gonna stop this subpoena.

263
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,520
这不是伎俩  这就是我的本事
It's not a trick. It's what I do.

264
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,590
你需要做的  就是阻止那个混蛋
What you're gonna do, is stop that son of a bitch

265
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,590
让他不要插手我的生意
from getting his hands on my program.

266
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,870
瑞秋  不管有什么事都先等等再说
Rachel, whatever it is, it's going to have to wait.

267
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,670
可你让我把今天早上
Okay, but you told me to bring you everything

268
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,100
把贝利案的所有材料都拿给你
I have on the Bailey case this morning.

269
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,320
很好  放我桌子上吧
Great. Leave it on my desk

270
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,020
我这周抽时间看看
and I'll get to it sometime this week.

271
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,110
抱歉  杰西卡
Oh, I'm sorry, Jessica,

272
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,900
我希望今天就能和你探讨一下案情
I was really hoping that we could go over it today.

273
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,310
我这会急着要出去
I was hoping to be out the door by now.

274
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,540
我知道我说过
Look, I know that I said

275
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,290
这案子不会耽误你太多时间  可是...
this wouldn't take up too much of your time, but...

276
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,200
瑞秋  我都答应你了  肯定会帮忙的
Rachel, I said I would do this, and I will,

277
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,280
-但你一定要有耐心  -我能理解
- but you just have to be patient. - I understand.

278
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,680
可伦纳德・贝利已经等了12年了
It's just, Leonard Bailey's been patient for 12 years.

279
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,350
我同情这个人
And I have sympathy for the man,

280
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,410
但今天不行
but today's not the day.

281
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,170
不用拿菜单了  来份科布沙拉就好
Don't bother with another menu. I'll just have a Cobb salad.

282
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,450
你这是要干什么
What do you think you're doing?

283
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,740
你觉得呢
What does it look like I'm doing?

284
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,810
我正在跟客户共进午餐
I'm having lunch with a client

285
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,220
讨论他的投资业务
to discuss his investment business.

286
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,840
你又没代理我的投资业务
You don't represent my investment business.

287
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,360
所以才应该共进午餐
Which is exactly why we need to have lunch.

288
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,650
不  我们没这个必要
No, we don't need to have anything,

289
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,660
因为我们有协议  
'cause the deal was Harvey gets me cleared

290
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,900
哈维帮我扫清刑事诉讼后
of criminal charges,

291
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,300
你才能接管我剩下的业务
then you get the rest of my business.

292
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,830
我不在乎那份之前的协议  威廉
I don't care what the deal was, William.

293
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,220
我在乎的是现在这份
I care what the deal is.

294
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,790
因为眼下你马上就要被起诉了
Because now that that indictment's come down,

295
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,310
哈维的全部精力都会花在你身上
Harvey is going to be spending all of his time on you.

296
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,620
-这与我无关  -那我就把它归结到你身上
- That's not my problem. - I'm making it your problem.

297
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,390
我们接管你的所有业务  不然就此收手
We get all of your business, or we handle none of it.

298
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,550
荒唐
Bullshit.

299
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,410
你们退出  这笔可观的服务费就泡汤了
You quit, you lose billables you can't afford to lose.

300
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,320
我们退出  别人会觉得我们意识到了
We quit, and it looks like we realized

301
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,490
你的案子注定是败局所以想撤退
your case was a loser and wanted distance from it,

302
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,010
这舆论你们也承担不起
which you can't afford.

303
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,350
你真的想以这种方式开始合作关系吗
You really want to start a business relationship this way?

304
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,370
我不在乎如何开始  威廉
I don't give a shit how it starts, William.

305
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,140
我只关心别人怎么看
I give a shit how it looks.

306
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,500
原来你是因为这个才来这
Oh, that's why you did this here.

307
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,530
你想让别人认为  你们已经代理我的公司了
You want it to look like you already represent my firm.

308
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,720
反应够快
Well, look at that.

309
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,830
看来你没雇错人
Looks like I'm worth hiring after all.

310
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,840
那我们究竟是合作呢
So are we actually going to talk business,

311
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,110
还是还是单纯的雇佣关系
or am I just gonna bill you for the pleasure of my company?

312
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,930
什么事  迈克
Mike, what can I do for you?

313
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,330
请你告诉我  你会不会用诚实疗法
You can tell me if you do straight-up therapy or not.

314
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,120
-为什么这么问  -你没回答我的问题
- What's on your mind? - You didn't answer my question.

315
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,520
我觉得没这个必要
I didn't think I needed to,

316
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,230
因为自从你入狱
since we've been doing straight-up therapy

317
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,470
我们一直都采用这种疗法
since you got here.

318
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,440
说吧  找我到底什么事
So, you want to tell me what you're here for?

319
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,600
我十一岁时  父母被一个醉酒的司机撞死了
My parents were killed by a drunk driver when I was 11,

320
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,490
然而昨天我发现
and yesterday I found out that

321
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,560
凯文在醉酒的状态下差点撞死了人
Kevin almost killed someone drunk driving.

322
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,620
因此我想让你帮我  在他面前表现得正常些
So I need you to help me act normal around him,

323
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,800
从而达到我的目的  最终离开这里
so that I can get what I need, so I can get out of here.

324
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,870
问题就出在这
Oh, well, that's gonna be a problem.

325
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,290
因为这种治疗的目的
Because the goal of therapy

326
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,640
不在于表现的正常  而是真正的正常
is not to act normal, it's to be normal.

327
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,770
我回到家跟心爱的女人在一起
Yeah, well, I'll be normal when I'm home

328
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,200
就会正常  也不会梦到
with the woman I love instead of dreaming

329
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,390
跟我住一间牢房的人杀掉了她
that the guy I'm sharing a cell with killed her.

330
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,040
-什么  -我昨晚做了个梦
- What? - I had a dream last night

331
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,710
梦到我不再需要告发凯文了
that I didn't have to inform on Kevin anymore,

332
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,490
因为他在一次事故中杀掉了瑞秋
because he killed Rachel in an accident.

333
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,220
我肯定是做梦的时候说梦话了
And I must have been talking about it in my sleep,

334
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,990
因为他今天问起我了
because he asked me about it today,

335
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,170
我给他讲了事故那段梦  然后我们就吵了起来
so I told him the accident part, and then we got in a fight.

336
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,220
-为什么吵起来  -我问他
- Fight about what? - I asked him

337
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,320
是否因为撞了人感到愧疚
if he even felt bad about the guy he hit.

338
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,350
也就是说你把责任推到了他身上
So you turned it back on him?

339
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,600
你这话什么意思
What is that even supposed to mean?

340
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,840
意思是  我觉得你找茬跟凯文打架
It means that I think you picked a fight with Kevin

341
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,100
因为你自己不愿意思考
because you didn't want to think about

342
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
为什么会做那种梦
why you had that dream.

343
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,650
我知道为什么
I know why I had the dream.

344
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,030
是因为他差点撞死别人
It's because he almost killed someone

345
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,190
而我父母就是被撞死的
the same way my parents were killed.

346
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,310
不  你做那梦  是因为你不愿意面对
No, you had the dream, because you don't want to deal

347
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,700
你对朋友的背叛
with what you're doing to your friend.

348
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,950
-又来这套  -没错  就是这套
- Oh, this again. - Yes, this again.

349
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,190
迈克  你觉得在你梦里
Mike, why do you think part of the dream was finding out

350
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,180
不再需要出卖他的原因是什么
that you didn't have to inform on him anymore?

351
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,920
该死  我来这里
God damn it, I did not come here

352
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,480
为的不是质疑我的决定
to second guess my decision.

353
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,390
你知道吗  我不在乎
Do you know what? I don't care.

354
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,200
因为如果我不告诉你这个行为的后果
Because I wouldn't be doing my job,

355
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,170
我就没有尽职尽责
if I didn't inform you that actions have consequences,

356
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,400
但看来你自认为
and you seem to think that

357
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,080
你所作所为的唯一结果
the only consequence of what you're doing

358
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,880
就是能提早出狱  其实不然
is getting out of here early, but it's not.

359
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,740
我觉得你对我所经历的事一无所知
I think you don't know shit about what I've been through.

360
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,200
真不该来找你帮我
It's a mistake coming to you for help.

361
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,320
这是第五个卧室
And this is the fifth bedroom,

362
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,640
我完全不介意你拆墙
and I'm completely open to you knocking down walls

363
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,210
或者封堵窗户
or removing windows, by the way.

364
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,150
不用  我喜欢窗户
No, I love the windows.

365
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,800
-窗户使得光线充足  -我同意
- They let in so much light. - I agree.

366
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,550
我们应该加一面玻璃墙  你觉得呢
We should add a wall of glass. What do you think?

367
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,240
我觉得这个地方太漂亮了
I think the place is beautiful,

368
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,530
谢谢你带来这些照片
and I appreciate you bringing these photos over,

369
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,940
但我们什么时候能亲自去看看
but when can we go see it in person?

370
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,810
-亲自去  -没错
- In person? - Yes, of course.

371
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,800
我得在开始绘图之前看一下空间布局
I need to see the space before I can start drafting anything.

372
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,480
我以为我们在开始之前
I was just thinking we could work closer together

373
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,530
能先紧密合作六十到九十天
for the next 60 to 90 days before you started that.

374
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,730
那样效率太低
That wouldn't be productive.

375
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,990
但我在接下来的七到十个工作日内
But I couldn't possibly make it out there

376
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,430
都去不了那里
in less than seven to ten business days.

377
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,630
那太可惜了
That's too bad.

378
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,440
我本来想后天去那看看的
I was gonna be out there the day after tomorrow.

379
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,790
我以为我们能看看房子
I was thinking we could see the space,

380
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,190
然后吃个午餐什么的
and then maybe go have lunch.

381
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,420
一起吃  午餐
Lunch? Together?

382
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,160
我没想过我们要分开吃饭
Well, I wasn't thinking of eating in separate restaurants.

383
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,050
当然不会
Ha! Of course you weren't.

384
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,600
后天没问题
Day after tomorrow's perfect.

385
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,650
-但我以为你不能  -我能  我会去的
- But I thought you couldn't-- - I can, and I will,

386
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,170
那我们后天下午  在我祖传的
and I will meet you at my ancestral home,

387
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,190
属于我一段时间了的别墅见
that I've owned for quite some time, day after tomorrow.

388
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,740
法官大人  我只是要求萨特先生提交
Your Honor, I'm simply requesting Mr. Sutter hand over--

389
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,370
你没权要求他提交的东西
Something he has not right to.

390
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,460
我有权力确保
I have every right to make sure

391
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,550
你的客户在法律要求范围内进行操作
that your client is operating within the law.

392
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,590
你是基于什么说他不在法律要求范围内呢
And what exactly is your basis to say that he isn't?

393
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,890
法官大人  当你打破本垒打记录
Your Honor, when you break the home run record,

394
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,670
但有人说"你的球棒有问题"时
and someone says, "Your bat is corked,"

395
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,250
你转身给他们看你的球棒并没问题
you turn it over to show it's not.

396
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,960
除非这个球棒正是你击出所有全垒打的原因
Except when that bat is the reason you hit all those homers,

397
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,530
因为一旦他拿到了球棒
because the second he gets it,

398
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,940
全世界的人都知道里面有什么了
everyone in the world's gonna know what's in it.

399
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,450
那我的客户还不如现在直接关门停业得了
And my client might as well go out of business right now.

400
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,070
这是个毫无证据支持的
That is a ridiculous supposition

401
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,980
可笑的假设
without a shred of proof to back it up.

402
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,420
这个证据如何
How's this for proof?

403
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,760
法官大人  六年前
Your Honor, six years ago,

404
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,340
卡荷尔先生做过像这次一样的非法调查
Mr. Cahill went on a fishing expedition just like this one.

405
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,980
这二者毫无关系
That has nothing to do with this.

406
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,700
是吗
doesn't it?

407
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,030
他传讯过凯斯勒投资公司的
He subpoenaed a proprietary trading program

408
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,580
一个自营交易软件
from Kessler Capital.

409
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,010
结果证明没有非法行为
It proved no wrongdoing,

410
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,790
十个月之后  他们就倒闭了
and ten months later they were out of business.

411
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,600
这跟我的传讯毫无关系
That has nothing to do with my subpoena.

412
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,660
我有一份来自凯斯勒先生的宣誓书说
And I have an affidavit here from Mr. Kessler saying

413
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,050
这和你的传讯有直接关系
it was directly because of your subpoena.

414
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,460
卡荷尔先生  他说的是事实吗
Mr. Cahill, is what he's saying true?

415
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,420
你对凯斯勒用过同样的手段
Did you go after Kessler in the same manner,

416
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,410
十个月后他倒闭了吗
and did he go under ten months later?

417
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,430
-是的  但是...  -没有但是
- Yes, but-- - No buts,

418
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,470
你还有其他证据向当庭提供吗
do you have any other evidence to present to the court?

419
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,750
目前没有了  法官大人
Not at this time, Your Honor.

420
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,990
那你的要求被驳回了
Then your request is denied.

421
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,530
原来你在这呢
There you are.

422
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,130
你在行政总厨干什么
What the hell are you doing in the executive kitchen?

423
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,060
你觉得我像在干什么  我在管事呢
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm being executive.

424
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,190
但你不是主管
But you're not an executive.

425
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,780
我决定了我自己是  我就是了
Until I made the executive decision that I was.

426
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,830
有什么我能帮你的吗
Now, is there something I can help you with?

427
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,770
有  我想让你先别惦记拿铁
Yeah. I want you to forget that latte

428
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,930
给我搞到自由进出新房子的权利
and get me unfettered access to my new home,

429
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,890
并且把房子前任住户的痕迹
after thoroughly cleansing it

430
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,590
清理得一干二净
of any trace of its former occupants.

431
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,280
你到底为什么想要我这么做
And why, exactly, do you need me to do that?

432
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,760
因为塔拉后天想看房子
Because Tara wants to see the house,

433
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,420
然后我们要共进午餐
and then have lunch with me the day after tomorrow.

434
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,540
路易  你的报价刚被接受
Louis, your offer was just accepted,

435
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,970
在公证史上从来没有
and there's never been a one-day escrow

436
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,070
一天就走完流程的
in the history of escrows.

437
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,200
你以为我不知道吗
You don't think I know that?

438
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,070
我前一个小时一直都在
I just spent the last hour

439
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,790
和五个不同的公证人员周旋
arguing with five different escrow officers.

440
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,800
我明白了
I get it.

441
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,640
你想让我推动人们
You want me to get people to do things

442
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,790
在一段不可能完成任务的时间内
they'd never be willing to do,

443
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,230
做他们永远不想做的事
in a timeframe that makes it impossible for them to do it in.

444
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,160
-完全正确  -那给我弄杯双份拿铁
- Exactly. - Then make me a double latte

445
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,960
然后别在这妨碍我干活
and get the hell out of my way,

446
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,780
因为我将要去执行主管决定
because I'm about to executive decision

447
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,660
让你能进那所房子了
your sorry ass into that house.

448
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,500
你喝什么呢
What are you drinking?

449
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,850
一瓶六十年的世界顶级纯麦威士忌
A 60-year-old bottle of the finest single malt in the world.

450
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,950
给我来一杯
Then get me a glass.

451
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,770
你先告诉我今天法庭上的事再说
Not until I know what happened in court today.

452
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,260
我这么跟你说吧
Well, let me put it this way.

453
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,050
卡荷尔今天晚上唯一能喝的
The only thing that Sean Cahill's gonna be drinking tonight

454
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,940
就是不走运牌的鸡尾酒
is a shit-out-of-luck daiquiri.

455
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,050
你是怎么办到的
How'd you get it done?

456
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,460
我给建立了一个
I established a pattern of him

457
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,420
他习惯没有足够证据就起诉形象
going fishing without enough bait.

458
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,180
那就喝一杯  然后赶紧回去
Then have a drink before you get back in there

459
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,930
让那混蛋再无还手之力
and knock the bastard out before he can throw another punch.

460
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,170
-你什么意思  -我的意思是
- What are you saying? - I'm saying,

461
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,370
我要你直接撤销这个案子
I want you to get this entire action dismissed.

462
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,570
威廉  这不是个好主意
William, that's a terrible idea.

463
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,650
对我来说是  因为他没有任何证据
Not to me, because he's got nothing.

464
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,400
这我不管
I don't care.

465
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,570
你的建议是个大错误
What you're suggesting is a mistake.

466
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,220
你还是没解释为什么
You still haven't told me why.

467
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,930
因为撤诉申请只有一次机会
Because you only get one shot at dismissal,

468
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,540
现在还不到时候
and now's not the time to take it.

469
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,520
我说到了  这不是建议
Well, I say it is. I'm not suggesting it.

470
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,980
我是在命令你这么做
I'm flat out telling you to do it.

471
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,400
我有今天的名声也不是因为被委托人威胁得来的
I didn't get where I am by letting my clients bully me.

472
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,220
我有今天的名声
And I didn't get where I am

473
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,960
也不是屈服于我的雇员得来的
by allowing my employees to dictate terms,

474
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,300
而且今天我已经屈服了一次
which I already did once today.

475
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,410
我不打算再来一次
I'm not gonna do it again.

476
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,470
你什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

477
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,930
意思是杰西卡・皮尔逊今天下午逼我把
It means Jessica Pearson convinced me to give your firm

478
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,630
其余的业务也交给了你们
the rest of my business this afternoon.

479
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,970
所以如果你不去
So if you don't move to

480
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,870
申请撤诉
have the charges against me dismissed,

481
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,470
我就让她代替你
I'll have her do it for you.

482
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,260
哈维  我正要出去
Harvey, I was just on my way out.

483
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,850
你不用出去了
Well, you can be on your way back in,

484
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,550
因为我刚从萨特那回来
because I just came from Sutter's.

485
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,530
看来他告诉你我们聊了两句的事了
I take it he told you about our little conversation today.

486
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,040
如果你所谓的聊了两句的意思是指
If, by conversation, you mean going behind my back

487
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,520
你背着我签了他的投资业务
and getting his investment business,

488
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,980
那么没错  他是告诉我了
then yeah, he told me.

489
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,500
我没有背着你干什么
I didn't go behind your back.

490
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,430
只是看到了一个机遇  采取了行动而已
I saw an opportunity, and I took it.

491
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,580
现在他也看到了一个机遇  采取了行动
Well, now he's seeing an opportunity, and he's taking it.

492
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,520
什么意思
What are you talking about?

493
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,020
他拿你们的合同威胁我
He's leveraging what you did

494
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,510
要我申请撤诉
to get me to move for an immediate dismissal.

495
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,010
我猜猜  你觉得能成功
And, don't tell me, you think it's gonna work?

496
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,080
肯定能成
I sure as hell do.

497
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,410
一旦成功
And the second it does,

498
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,510
迈克出狱的希望也就破灭了
Mike's chance at getting out goes with it,

499
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,590
托你的福
thanks to you.

500
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,040
镇定  小老虎
Hang on there, tiger.

501
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,050
你现在的处境不是因为我做了什么
You're not in this position because of something I did.

502
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,540
而是因为萨特
You're in it because of Sutter,

503
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,930
不管他有没有把业务给我们
and he'd be demanding you have this case dismissed

504
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,870
都会命令你申请撤诉
whether we have his other business or not.

505
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,280
-这不是重点  -不  哈维  重点是
- That's not the point. - No, Harvey, the point is,

506
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,010
我这几天在外面
I have been out there busting my ass

507
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,490
费尽力气给我们拉新业务
trying to find us new business for days,

508
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,300
你知道他们最爱问哪个问题吗
and do you know what they keep asking?

509
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,440
我们为什么还没拿到萨特的投资业务
Why don't we have Sutter's investment business.

510
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,710
一点没错  我们需要拿到它
Goddamn right. We needed it.

511
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,670
于是我拿到了  现在他们都不问了
I got it, and now they're not asking anymore.

512
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,190
那要是我们输掉了官司
Well, what's gonna happen when we lose this case,

513
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,710
失去了他的业务呢
and his business goes away?

514
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,820
到那时  我们已经恢复了元气
What happens is, we're already built back up by then,

515
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,710
所以别再来指责说
so instead of blaming me

516
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,450
是我害你陷入了萨特让你陷入的困境
for the position Sutter has put you in,

517
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,900
我建议你
I suggest you go ahead

518
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,590
想个办法自己解决
and find yourself a way out of it.

519
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,350
瑞秋  有什么事情吗
Rachel, what can I do for you?

520
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,760
我是希望您能为伦纳德・贝利做点事情
I was hoping you could do something for Leonard Bailey.

521
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,340
我拟写了动议  重开他的案子
I drafted a motion to reopen his case,

522
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,390
但我需要一个正式律师递交申请
but I need a current member of the Bar to file it.

523
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,830
你说能监督你办案子的
And what happened to the person you said

524
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,040
那个律师呢
was gonna take this on?

525
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,320
她得等到这周末才有时间
She can't get to it till later this week,

526
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,930
但我想尽快开始
but I want to get on this as soon as possible.

527
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,380
瑞秋  我很抱歉  但我说了
Rachel, I'm sorry, but I told you before,

528
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,660
我现在没有时间精力给这个案子
I don't have the resources to work on this case now.

529
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,540
教授  这个人的妻子放弃了他
Professor, this man has a wife who gave up on him

530
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,570
孩子也见不到面
and children that he doesn't see.

531
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,530
他的整个人生正在离他而去
His entire life is passing him by,

532
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,120
而唯一能给他一个找回人生的机会
and the only way for him to start getting it back

533
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,280
就是有一个人能在意一点
is to just have someone who cares enough about him

534
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,140
腾出半个小时时间做点事
that they give him a half hour of their time.

535
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,880
我看看动议
Let me see your motion.

536
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,810
写得很不错
This is well drafted.

537
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,750
谢谢
Thank you.

538
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,520
但恐怕不会成功
But I'm afraid it won't work.

539
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,190
什么意思  不会
What are you talking--no--

540
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,980
根本就没有理由给他定罪
look, there's no reason that he should have been convicted.

541
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,860
-您看看证据  -这不是重点  瑞秋
- Look at the evidence. - That's not the point, Rachel.

542
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,830
我办过很多这种案子了
I've worked on dozens of these cases,

543
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,800
不管你怎么想  重开旧案的标准
and like it or not, the standard to reopen

544
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,460
实际上比规定高出很多
is higher than what it says in the books.

545
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,710
你需要铁证才行
You need something undeniable.

546
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,590
那我该怎么做
Then what am I supposed to do?

547
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,650
你需要投入精力去找到一个铁证
You're supposed to use your gumption to find that something,

548
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,000
然后才能还他公正
and get Leonard Bailey the justice he's been waiting for.

549
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,930
哈维  很晚了
Harvey, it's late.

550
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,400
不管你来干什么  
Whatever you're doing here

551
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,220
都得等到明天再说
is gonna have to wait until morning.

552
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,230
-不行  -为什么
- It can't. - Why's that?

553
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,910
因为萨特要我即刻申请撤诉
Because Sutter wants me to move for an immediate dismissal.

554
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,760
什么
What?

555
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,430
是你让我提出诉讼的
You leveraged me into bringing this indictment,

556
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,620
现在你又要毁了它
and now you want to toss it?

557
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,060
我不想毁掉它  但我要是不申请
I don't want to toss it, but if I don't,

558
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,970
他就会换律师申请
he's gonna find someone else who will.

559
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,320
你来干什么  哈维
What are you doing here, Harvey?

560
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,590
没什么  吃晚餐而已
Nothing, I'm just finishing my dinner.

561
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,790
但是  我不喜欢扔垃圾
The thing is, I don't like to litter,

562
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,120
不如你帮我个忙
so why don't you do me a favor?

563
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,750
要是我走的时候忘了扔
If I forget this when I go,

564
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,800
能不能请你拿上去替我扔了
why don't you take it upstairs and throw it away?

565
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,090
包里放了什么  哈维
What's in the bag, Harvey?

566
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,960
一个包装纸  几张餐巾纸
A wrapper, couple napkins,

567
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,290
还有点薯条
and a few extra fries.

568
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,120
哈维  老实告诉我包里到底放了什么
What the hell is in the bag, Harvey?

569
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,910
放着你需要用来保护案子
What you needed to keep this case going,

570
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,940
而我一直不让你碰的东西
and I stopped you from getting.

571
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,630
妈的  你之前还说你会尽你一切所能
Damn it, you said you were gonna defend him

572
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,830
-帮他辩护  -那也是真的
- to the best of your ability. - And I meant it.

573
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,170
但我当时也知道  如果这和把救出迈克
But I also knew, if push came to shove,

574
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,670
有所冲突的话  我会选择救迈克
I'd do what I had to to get Mike out,

575
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,130
并且我能接受这么做
and I made my peace with it.

576
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,880
-可是我还没有如此觉悟  -你有的
- Yeah, well, I haven't. - Yes, you have.

577
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,850
你到底在说什么
What are you talking about?

578
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,520
你一直给我扯那些不和我共谋之类的调子
You've been giving me this song and dance about not colluding,

579
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,910
而且只要是让你相信我们不共谋的话
and it didn't matter what I said back to you,

580
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,060
无论我怎么回复你都无关紧要了
as long as it was something to let you believe we wouldn't.

581
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,050
因为那些陈词滥调不是为了我好  是为了你好
Because that song wasn't for me, it was for you.

582
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,250
为了我好  狗屁
For me? Bullshit.

583
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,730
这不是狗屁的  肖恩
I don't think so, Sean,

584
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,490
因为你不会只为了仕途晋升
because you don't break a guy out of prison

585
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,510
而帮人越狱
just to advance your career.

586
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,440
这案子对你意义重大
Look, this means something to you.

587
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,280
我不需要知道为什么
I don't need to know what it is,

588
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,930
但是它同样对我意义重大
but it means something to me too,

589
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,120
所以痛快承认我们同一战线
so let's just admit that we're in this together

590
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,560
完成这件事
and get this thing done.

591
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,930
拿走你的垃圾自己扔了
Take that garbage and throw it away.

592
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,530
现在能和我共饮一杯了吗
Now can I have champagne?

593
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,590
你让中介把别墅的钥匙给你了
You got the realtor to give you the key to the house.

594
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,070
不但如此  我还让他决定明天
Not only that, I got him to agree to take the Kellmans

595
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,460
十点到两点带科尔曼斯去
to brunch tomorrow from 10:00 to 2:00

596
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,240
吃庆功早午餐
to celebrate their big sale.

597
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,160
太好了  唐娜
Well, that is great, Donna,

598
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,850
但是我不但需要自由进出这座别墅
but I don't just need to get into the house.

599
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,460
我还要塔拉相信我是别墅的主人  意味着
I need Tara to believe that it's my house, which means--

600
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,430
意味着门上的锁盒不能有
No lock box on the door,

601
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,520
院子里的待售牌子不能有
no for sale sign in the yard,

602
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,120
别墅里的私人物品不能有
and no personal belongings in the house,

603
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,310
因此我们要十点零一分到达那里
which is why we are gonna be there at 10:01

604
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,370
好好把房子布置一下
to stage the shit out of that place.

605
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,930
而且我们要带着这堆东西去
and these are coming with us.

606
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,800
你把布鲁诺的照片重新装裱了
You reframed pictures of Bruno?

607
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,530
配合别墅的样式  是的
In the style of the house.

608
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,460
而且不只布鲁诺
And not just Bruno...

609
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,270
还有米卡多
Mikado.

610
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,520
太棒了  唐娜
That's perfect, Donna.

611
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,850
我只是觉得要让她了解你的为人
I just thought showing Tara your wood

612
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,220
让她看你有什么样的木头不是唯一的方法
wasn't the only way to show her what kind of man you are.

613
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,690
谢谢你  唐娜
Thank you, Donna.

614
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,300
不客气  路易
You're welcome, Louis.

615
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,330
我们居然也用上房间
Since when do we get a room

616
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,500
不用再通过那些低级电话机了
instead of having to use those damn phones?

617
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,820
因为我正式成为你法务团队的一部分了
Since I officially became part of your legal team.

618
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,320
-我的法务团队  -没错
- My legal team? - That's right.

619
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,140
我工作的事务所接下了你的案子
The firm that I work for is taking your case.

620
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,740
这么久以来...
After all this time.

621
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,010
谢谢
Thank you.

622
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,050
不客气
You're welcome.

623
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,790
但是我们还需要想办法重开你的案子
But we still need to get the case reopened,

624
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,260
为此我们需要找新的证据
and to do that we need to find something new.

625
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,810
我们要怎么做
So where do we get that?

626
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,410
我看了案件卷宗
I was going through the state's case file,

627
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,240
里面有审讯记录
and I read your police report.

628
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,360
你说那天晚上你和一个女人待在一起
You said there was a woman with you that night

629
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,570
她能证明你没有杀害那对夫妻
who can testify that you didn't kill that couple.

630
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,400
对的  叫玛利亚
That's right, Maria,

631
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,970
但那不是新的证据
but that's not new.

632
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,210
但对法庭来说它是新证据
Well, it's new as far as the court's concerned,

633
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,400
因为它从未被庭审承认呈供过
because it was never admitted at trial.

634
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,350
那就提交啊
Well, let's admit it.

635
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,220
没那么容易
It's not that easy.

636
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,100
我要知道它当时为何没被承认
I need to understand why it was never admitted.

637
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,850
因为那个女人突然在庭审前玩失踪
Because the damn woman up and disappeared before my trial.

638
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,800
而我的律师也没去想办法
My lawyer didn't do a thing.

639
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,650
你有不在场证明的证人
You had an alibi witness,

640
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,520
然而你的公诉人却让她走掉了
and your public defender let her get away.

641
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,640
我一直都是这么说的啊
That's what I've been saying.

642
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,930
玛利亚本来可以向陪审团证明人不是我杀的
Maria could have told the jury that I didn't do it,

643
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,570
但最后却没了证人
instead no one told them.

644
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,380
两周之后  我就被关起来了
Two weeks later, I'm in here,

645
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,750
时至今日我仍然被关在这里
and I've been here ever since.

646
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,240
你还有其他什么事情没有告诉我吗
Is there anything else I need to know?

647
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,440
那我就得去找玛利亚・戈麦斯了
Then I need to find Maria Gomez.

648
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,500
拜托  我现在真的不想说话
Look, man, please, I really don't want to talk.

649
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,080
没问题  因为是我有话要说
Good, 'cause I want you to listen.

650
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,230
我小时候  我以为我们过得还不错
When I was a kid, I thought we had it good.

651
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,180
也确实还行
And we did.

652
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,010
有好的房子  好的邻居
Had a nice house, nice neighborhood.

653
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,660
除了一件事
Except for one thing.

654
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,520
原来我的父亲
Turns out my father...

655
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,470
是个罪犯
was a criminal.

656
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,900
某一天他被抓了  蹲了监狱
One day he got caught. He went to prison.

657
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,390
我的生活因而分崩离析
My whole life fell apart.

658
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,290
你当时多大
How old were you?

659
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,780
15岁
15.

660
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,540
我告诉你
I'll tell you something.

661
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,650
我因为恨那个人毁了我的生活
I hated that man for doing what he did to me,

662
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,950
做了生活一团糟的15岁少年都会做的事
so I did what messed up 15-year-olds do.

663
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,660
-行为乖张  -乖张
- Started acting out. - Acting out?

664
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,780
兄弟  我当时的前景比这惨多了
Brother, I was on my way to a place worse than this.

665
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,770
最终  我妈妈强迫我去看心理医生
Finally, my mom made me see someone,

666
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,590
他让我意识到  如果当时我不做出改变
and he helped me realize that if I didn't change,

667
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,060
我会毁了自己的一生
I was gonna ruin my life.

668
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,930
因此我力求改正  把生活转向了正常轨道
So I straightened out and turned my life around.

669
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,050
这就是你选择这份职业的原因
And that's why you do what you do.

670
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,230
是的
Yeah.

671
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,120
你为什么要跟我说这些
Why are you telling me this?

672
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,150
因为那个人说服了我是因为
Because the way that man got through to me

673
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,250
他向我打开了自己的心扉
was to open up about himself,

674
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,360
我意识到如果我真的想要帮你
and I realized that if I really want to help you,

675
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,640
我也得这样做
I got to do the same.

676
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,470
好吧  我已经在尽力拖延了
All right, I dragged this out as long as I can,

677
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,230
但这个动议真的拟的差不多了
but I'm pretty much done drafting this motion.

678
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,330
所以我要你递交...
So I'll need you to proof it--

679
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,150
哈维  在那之前
Harvey, before I do that,

680
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,710
我想你得看看这个
I think you should take a look at these.

681
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,340
-什么  -卡荷尔申请了传票
- What is it? - Cahill issued subpoenas

682
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,600
要对威廉・萨特和凯文・米勒进行取证
to deposition William Sutter and Kevin Miller.

683
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,470
这个卑鄙的杂种
That sneaky son of a bitch.

684
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,500
你笑什么
Why are you smiling?

685
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,990
因为昨晚我去找了卡荷尔
Because last night I went to Cahill

686
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,260
想把萨特的交易程序给他
and tried to give him Sutter's trading program.

687
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,910
你做了什么
You did what?

688
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,020
这是我认为唯一能让
It was the only way I could see

689
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,930
这个案子不被撤销的方法
to stop the case from getting dismissed,

690
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,170
但是他没接受
but he wouldn't take it.

691
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,640
而这能给你争取时间
And this buys you time.

692
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,980
是的  前提是法官等卡荷尔
It does, if the judge waits to rule on our motion

693
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,870
取证完之后再判决我们的动议
until after Cahill conducts these depositions.

694
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,930
哈维  即使这样有用
Harvey, even if that works,

695
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,770
要是卡荷尔不能取证到足够的证据
what if Cahill doesn't get enough from the depositions

696
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,920
以让案件不被撤销呢
to keep the case alive?

697
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,950
那迈克出狱的机会也就没了
Then Mike's chance of getting out of prison is gone,

698
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,600
也就意味着要利用这个机会
which means Cahill's not the only one

699
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,910
得到点结果的人不只卡荷尔一个人
that needs to use this to try and get something.

700
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,660
我得承认  赞恩小姐
I have to admit, Ms. Zane,

701
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,390
当你说要查看贝利的案子
when you said you were looking into the Bailey case,

702
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,720
真是激起了我的好奇心
my interest was piqued.

703
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,150
这是很久以前的案子了
That was a long time ago.

704
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,040
明显你不做公设辩护人
Well, you've obviously come a long way

705
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,930
过得好了很多
since your public defender days.

706
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,820
在这种工作里你几乎看不到什么人性美好
You don't exactly see the best of humanity at that job,

707
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,610
这也就让你不能坚持很久
which makes it one you can only do for so long.

708
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,080
但你肯定不是来给我心理治疗的
But you didn't come here to be my therapist.

709
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,120
不  我想谈谈玛利亚・戈麦斯
No, I came to talk about Maria Gomez.

710
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,010
她怎么了
What about her?

711
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,650
我很好奇在有一个能做
I'm curious as to how you can have

712
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,190
不在场证明证人的前提下
an alibi witness on a murder case,

713
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,130
你的委托人还是成了死囚犯
and your client ends up on death row.

714
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,040
因为我并没有一个能做不在场证明的证人
Because I didn't have an alibi witness.

715
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,070
证人凭空消失了
I had a no-show who vanished into thin air,

716
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,990
而我也没有办法找到她
and I didn't have the resources to find her.

717
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,000
你也没想问问负责的警察为什么
And you didn't think to ask the police at trial

718
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,010
他们没有跟进伦纳德的不在场证明吗
why they didn't follow up on Leonard's alibi?

719
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,080
我想到了
I did think of it,

720
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,880
但他们总是一贯的说辞
and they would have said what they always say,

721
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,830
"每个杀人犯都说自己有不在场证明"
"Every murderer claims to have an alibi,"

722
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,710
如果我都提不出来  他们为什么要跟进
and if I couldn't produce her, why should they?

723
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,440
你至少可以要求延期受审
Well, you could have at least asked for postponement,

724
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,610
来找到她
to have time to find her.

725
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,500
我是可以  只是还有个小问题
And I would have, except for one thing.

726
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,740
我不确定一个有前科的瘾君子
I wasn't sure a drug addict with a prior conviction

727
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,820
能帮到伦纳德・贝利什么忙
would have done Leonard Bailey much good.

728
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,470
这是她的品格问题  跟案件事实无关
That's about her character, not the facts of the case.

729
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,840
她的品格就是案件事实
Her character is a fact of the case,

730
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,490
当我要求她说出事发那时他们
and when I pressed her as to what the two of them were doing

731
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,830
两个人在做什么
at the time of those murders,

732
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,750
她承认说他们磕了冰毒
she admitted they were both on meth,

733
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,430
而且还不是第一次
and it wasn't the first time.

734
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,330
而这也可能跟她为什么没有
Which, by the way, might have something to do with

735
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,220
上庭作证有关
why she never showed up at trial.

736
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,250
你想重开这个案子随你  赞恩小姐
So you can try to reopen this case if you want, Ms. Zane,

737
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,670
但我得提醒你
but I am telling you,

738
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,330
你是在浪费自己的时间
you're wasting your time.

739
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,210
什么情况
What's going on?

740
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,060
情况就是我们时间不多了
What's going on is, the clock's ticking.

741
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,630
萨特想要我把案子撤销
Sutter wants me to get the case dismissed.

742
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,640
-什么  这样的话我就...  -我知道
- What? If that happens, I'll-- - I know.

743
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,810
现在听我说
Now, listen to me.

744
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,230
我为我们争取了一点时间
I bought us a little time,

745
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,780
但我要你做件事
but I need you to do something.

746
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,140
好
Okay.

747
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,510
-什么事  -萨特还不知道这件事
- What is it? - Sutter doesn't know this yet,

748
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,940
但我和他明天会来这里
but he and I are gonna be here tomorrow

749
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,260
帮凯文准备取证流程
to have a practice deposition with Kevin.

750
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,260
所以我要你尽力利用
So I need you to do the best

751
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,450
肖恩・卡荷尔这件事让他们说话
Sean Cahill you have to get them talking.

752
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,870
你要我加入他们吗
You want me in the room?

753
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,710
我不觉得这是个好主意
I don't think that's a good idea.

754
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,660
你没听到我说的吗  我们没有时间了
Didn't you hear me? We're running out of time.

755
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,260
我听到了  但我不觉得现在
I heard you, but I don't think it's a good idea

756
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,490
让我和凯文共处一室是个好主意
for me to be in the same room as Kevin right now.

757
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,120
-酒驾的事情吧  -你早都知道
- The drunk driving. - You knew?

758
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,300
-刚知道  -那你也应该知道
- I just found out. - Well, then you also know

759
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,620
现在不是让我和他称兄道弟的好时候
it's probably not the best time for me to chum up to him.

760
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,090
我不是要你跟他做好哥们儿
I'm not asking you to chum up to him.

761
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,980
我是叫你让他发飙
I'm asking you to piss him off.

762
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,250
-你什么意思  -凯文知道一些事情
- What are you talking about? - Kevin knows something,

763
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,740
但他什么都不说
and he's not talking.

764
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,460
我们可以在这里坐等两年
So we could sit around here for the next two years

765
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,480
等着他主动告诉你  但我们也可以
waiting for him to tell you, or we can light a fire

766
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,090
激怒他  提醒他
under his ass by reminding him

767
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,640
萨特逍遥法外
that Sutter's out there,

768
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,120
而他却在蹲监狱
while he's in here.

769
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,490
你到底同不同意
Now, are you with me or not?

770
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,500
同意
I'm with you.

771
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,660
我想你是来告诉我好消息的吧
I take it you're here to give me the good news.

772
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,470
-恐怕不是  -我还以为我说清楚了
- I'm afraid not. - I thought I made myself clear.

773
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,790
如果你不提交动议撤销这个...
If you don't make a motion to dismiss this--

774
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,310
我已经提交了撤销动议
I did file a motion to dismiss,

775
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,080
但这并没什么用
but it doesn't matter,

776
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,020
因为卡荷尔提交了传票申请
because Cahill filed subpoenas

777
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,210
要向你和你女婿取证
to depose you and your son-in-law first,

778
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,300
在取证结束前
and until those depositions happen,

779
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,370
法庭都不会对动议做裁定
the court won't file on the motion.

780
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,440
该死
Goddamn it.

781
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,710
他怎么就知道在我们
How the hell did he know to do that

782
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,010
正要撤销案子的时候想到用这个办法的
when we're about to have the case thrown out?

783
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,010
我不知道  但我过来不是和你讨论这个的
I don't know, but that's not what I came here to talk about,

784
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,170
因为我们得把你和凯文・米勒
because we need to get you and Kevin Miller

785
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,770
弄到一个房间里来准备你俩的供词
in a room to prepare you for your deposition.

786
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,920
你想让我们去监狱
You want us to go to prison?

787
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,160
我想不到别的办法了
I don't see any other choice,

788
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,410
所以你现在最好打电话
so you should call whoever it is

789
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,460
给你今天早上约好要见的人
you were gonna meet this morning

790
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,390
  告诉他们你来不了了
and tell them you can't make it,

791
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,610
因为你和我要去一趟丹伯里联邦监狱
because you and I are going to Danbury.

792
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,180
你是真的想帮我吗
Were you really serious about wanting to help me?

793
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,240
为什么我觉得这不是个单纯的问题
Why do I get the feeling that's not a simple question?

794
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,310
因为我想知道你是不是愿意给我查看
Because I want to know if you're willing to give me access

795
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,980
某些记录的权限
to certain records.

796
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,860
抱歉  迈克  我不能泄露其他囚犯的信息
I'm sorry, Mike, I cannot give information on other inmates.

797
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,530
没关系  因为我想找的不是
That's okay, because those aren't the records

798
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,800
那些记录
I'm looking for.

799
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,850
你找到玛利亚了吗
Did you find Maria?

800
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,690
其实  我还没开始找她
You know, I haven't even started looking for her yet,

801
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,220
因为你骗了我
because you lied to me.

802
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,810
什么
What?

803
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,640
我没跟你撒谎
I didn't lie to you about shit.

804
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,220
但你显然也没告诉我你和玛利亚
Well, you certainly didn't tell me that you and Maria

805
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,520
在谋杀发生当晚嗑药嗑嗨了
were high the night of those murders.

806
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,920
-谁跟你说的  -乔治娜・凯西
- Who told you that? - Georgina Casey.

807
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,420
你去见我之前的律师了
You went to see my old lawyer?

808
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,000
是的  没错
Yes, I did.

809
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,390
所以你现在坐在那边看着我就好像在说
And now you sitting over there looking at me like,

810
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,540
"谁知道  也许那些人真的是他杀的"
"You know, maybe he could have killed those people after all."

811
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,060
伦纳德  我去会面之时
Leonard, when I went into that meeting,

812
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,110
是站在你这一边的
I was on your side.

813
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,560
而会面结束之后你就改变立场了
And you came out of it off it.

814
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,800
不  当那场会面结束  我产生了疑问
No, when I came out of it, I had questions.

815
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,600
好啊  那就问啊  我没什么好藏的
Okay, ask them. I got nothing to hide.

816
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,750
真的吗  因为你上次就有事瞒着我
Really? Because you hid something from me the last time.

817
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,650
那不一样
That was different.

818
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,600
-不  那是相关事实  -不  不是的
- No, it's relevant. - No, it isn't.

819
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,830
谋杀发生当晚你嗑药嗑嗨了
You were high the night of the murders,

820
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,400
而你却撒谎没跟我说
and you lied to me about it.

821
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,860
因为我对过去的我感到羞愧
Because I'm ashamed of how I used to be.

822
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,050
我曾是个高中辍学毫无前途的孩子
I was a high school dropout on my way nowhere,

823
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,800
所以  是的  当我找到自己可以承受的起的
so, yeah, I looked for an escape

824
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,660
逃避方式的时候我就选择逃避了
when I could afford one.

825
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,020
我并没有说我没有犯错
I'm not saying I didn't make some mistakes

826
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,110
或者可能甚至还犯了一些罪
or maybe even commit a few crimes,

827
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,920
但我绝对没有杀害那些孩子
but killing those kids was not one of them.

828
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,410
事实就是这样  但我猜现在也无所谓了
And that's the truth, but I guess it doesn't matter,

829
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,320
因为如果你找不到玛利亚
because if you don't find Maria,

830
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,960
总有一天他们会把我送上刑场
someday they're gonna walk me down that hall

831
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,000
给我执行死刑
and put me to death.

832
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,650
那我猜我最好还是赶紧回去找到她
Then I guess I better get back to finding her.

833
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,470
但是  伦纳德  我跟你说清楚
But, Leonard, I'm telling you,

834
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,510
如果你不跟我坦诚一切
if you're not straight with me,

835
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,020
这案子就没法进行下去了
this isn't gonna work.

836
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,090
我绝对不会再隐瞒任何事了
Then I won't ever leave anything out again.

837
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,840
这太荒谬了  这孩子不是肖恩・卡荷尔
This is ridiculous. This kid's no Sean Cahill.

838
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,800
这孩子曾让肖恩・卡荷尔看起来像个傻瓜
This kid made Sean Cahill look like a fool

839
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,470
而他甚至还没有法学学位
without even having a law degree.

840
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,970
我得说一下  当你攻击对方律师的时候
Just so you know, when you attack opposing counsel,

841
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,500
会让你看起来是在害怕
it kind of makes you look afraid.

842
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,430
我可不怕你
I'm not afraid of you.

843
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,040
好的  那么你何不告诉我
Okay, then why don't you tell me this,

844
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,290
坐拥如此多的财富最棒的一点是什么
what's the best thing about having so much money?

845
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,280
-什么  -你听到我说的了
- What? - You heard me.

846
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,890
你在曼哈顿有间顶层公寓
You got the penthouse in Manhattan.

847
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,240
你在南法有座度假别墅  你有两艘游艇
You got the villa in the south of France. You get two yachts--

848
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,090
-那又怎么样  -那又怎么样
- So what? - So what?

849
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,040
所以我是不会想要放弃这一切的
So I wouldn't want to give all of that up.

850
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,350
你会吗  米勒先生
Would you, Mr. Miller?

851
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,540
-我  -是的  你
- Me? - Yeah, you.

852
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,540
我是说  你也能使用这些资产
I mean, you had use of all of these places too,

853
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,770
直到你因为酒驾抛弃了这所有一切
until you threw it all away driving drunk, that is.

854
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,130
-什么  -反对
- What? - Objection.

855
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,750
-与本案无关  -我觉得非常有关
- Irrelevant. - I think it's very relevant.

856
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,750
谁知道  也许凯文也跟财产有关呢
For all I know, Kevin could be somehow involved.

857
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,100
-真是荒唐  -这荒唐吗
- That's insane. - That's insane?

858
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,030
你是交易软件的开发者
You're the developer of the trading software.

859
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,370
我不是那个要受审的人
And I'm not the one who's on trial here.

860
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,110
那我们就来聊聊要受审的这位
Then let's talk about the one who is.

861
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,680
对于你岳父在你入狱期间从来没有前来探视
How do you feel about the fact that your father-in-law

862
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,460
这个事实你感觉如何
never came to visit you in prison?

863
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,730
-什么  -你听到我说的了
- Excuse me? - You heard me.

864
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,110
他从来没有探视过你  你什么感觉
He hasn't come to see you once. How does that make you feel?

865
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,550
对我来说无所谓
It doesn't matter to me.

866
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,330
他可能躺在法国里维埃拉的沙滩上
He could be lying on a beach in the French Riviera,

867
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,200
而你却几乎见不到你的老婆孩子
while you can barely see your wife and kids,

868
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,450
这样你也无所谓吗
and that doesn't matter to you?

869
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,980
米勒先生的家人和本案调查无关
Mr. Miller's family has nothing to do with this investigation.

870
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,530
米勒先生的家人就是本案调查的对象
Mr. Miller's family is the subject of this investigation,

871
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,010
而他的岳父很显然对此毫不关心
and his father in law clearly doesn't give a shit--

872
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,630
我很感激凯文为我做的一切
I'm grateful for everything Kevin's done for me,

873
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,870
-他也知道的  -嗯  我信了
- and he knows it. - Yeah, right.

874
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,640
抱歉  你刚说什么
I'm sorry, what was that?

875
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,960
你是不是想反驳他对你很感激这个说法
Are you disputing the fact that he's grateful to you?

876
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,500
我不会回答这个问题的
I'm not answering that question.

877
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,730
这根本毫无进展
This isn't getting us anywhere.

878
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,030
他在为你应对卡荷尔做准备
He's getting you ready for Cahill.

879
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,550
我本不需要为应对卡荷尔做准备
I wouldn't have to get ready for Cahill

880
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,100
如果你能尽职尽责把这件案子给撤销掉
if you did your goddamn job and got this case dismissed.

881
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,300
没错  就像你一直以来的做法一样
That's right, get someone else

882
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,000
找其他人来收拾你的烂摊子
to cover up your mess like you always do.

883
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,080
你是有什么想说的话吗
You got something you want to say to me?

884
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,200
我是有什么想对你做的事
I got something I want to do to you.

885
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,440
你最好给我记好了你是在和谁说话
You better remember who you're talking to.

886
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,760
我很清楚我是在和谁说话
I know exactly who I'm talking to,

887
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,630
就是那个只顾自己
the guy who doesn't give a shit

888
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,930
不顾他人的自私鬼
about anyone else other than himself.

889
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,670
-够了  -是够了
- That's enough. - That is enough.

890
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,510
要受审的是你
This is your trial.

891
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,500
不是我  我已经受够这些
It's not mine, and I'm done with this,

892
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,930
也受够你了
and I'm done with you!

893
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,640
警卫
Guard.

894
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,320
混账东西
Son of a bitch.

895
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,100
我就知道那小子是个麻烦
I knew that kid would be a problem.

896
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,530
镇定  我把迈克叫来也是这个原因
Relax. That's the whole reason I wanted Mike in here.

897
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,890
如果凯文在打什么歪主意
If Kevin gets any funny ideas,

898
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,530
迈克会先把他稳住  再通知我们的
Mike's gonna calm him down and let us know.

899
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,830
看来你们真的对彼此恨之入骨啊  不是吗
You guys really get under each other's skin, don't you?

900
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,130
你不知道我有多少次
You have no idea how many times

901
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,840
想一拳打在那自鸣得意的老脸上
I thought about punching that bastard in his smug face.

902
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,050
我猜他也很想打你吧
I'm guessing he's thought about punching you too.

903
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,940
你这话什么意思
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

904
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,490
意思是他女儿嫁给了一个罪犯
It means his daughter married a criminal.

905
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,400
-他还不得不接受这个事实  -我告诉你
- He's got to live with that. - You know what?

906
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,440
我也受够了你不停的
I've had just about enough of you

907
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,100
因为我犯的罪讽刺我
giving me shit for what I did.

908
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,180
也许你跟我说实话
Well, maybe I'll stop giving you shit

909
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,560
我就不会再讽刺你了
when your story starts adding up.

910
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,250
你说什么
Excuse me?

911
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,840
你说你是因酒驾被判了三年
You said you got three years for drunk driving,

912
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,990
但你没有前科
but you got no priors,

913
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,480
受害人还一点事儿都没有
and this guy made a full recovery.

914
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,310
百分之九十九的可能你应该能申请缓刑
99 times out of 100, that means you're getting probation.

915
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,760
那看来我的律师很烂咯
Then I guess I had shitty representation.

916
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,400
胡扯
Bullshit.

917
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,200
你这样的有钱人是不会请烂律师的
Money like yours doesn't buy shitty representation.

918
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,470
那不知道还能跟你说什么
Then I don't know what to tell you.

919
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,720
不如开始把真相告诉我啊
How about you start with telling me the goddamn truth?

920
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,110
你想知道真相吗  那我就告诉你
You want to know the truth? I'll tell you,

921
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,290
因为我也不想再藏着掖着了
because I'm sick of holding it in, man.

922
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,050
我被判三年  是因为检方让我告发他的时候
I got three years, because when they offered me a deal

923
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,180
我拒绝了
to turn on him, I said no.

924
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,820
你必须拒绝他们啊  他是清白的
You had to turn them down. He didn't do it.

925
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,170
不  我必须拒绝他们
No, I had to turn them down,

926
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,500
是因为涉案的不止他一个
because he's not the only one involved.

927
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,350
什么
What?

928
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,530
你问我当晚喝酒的原因
You asked me why I was drinking that night.

929
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,560
我喝酒是因为我发现长久以来不断努力
It was because I found out the thing that I worked so hard on

930
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,140
想到得到那自恋狂的认同的做法不过是谎言
to get that prick's approval was nothing but a lie.

931
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,630
-你的那个交易软件  -没错  我的软件
- Your trading program. - Yeah, my program.

932
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,430
到头来他根本就没用
Turns out he wasn't using it at all.

933
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,540
他其实一直都在内幕交易
He was just insider trading the whole time.

934
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,500
好  所以等你回家了  把这事告诉吉尔
Okay, so you got home, you told Jill,

935
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,080
她却不相信你
and she didn't believe you.

936
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,400
不  迈克
No, Mike.

937
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,410
她不只相信我  她...
She not only believed me, she...

938
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,330
她早就知情了
she already knew.

939
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,760
她参与了
She was in on it.

940
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,990
没错
Yeah.

941
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,860
所以我跑出家门  喝得酩酊大醉
So I went out, and I got drunk.

942
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,150
等我恢复意识了
And the next thing I knew,

943
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,180
发现要不然自己在牢里蹲三年
I had to choose between going to prison for three years,

944
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,380
要不然孩子们就再也见不到他们的妈妈了
or the mother of my children going away for a whole lot more.

945
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,510
凯文  你得...
Kevin, you got--

946
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,060
好了  我已经抹去了
Okay, I have removed

947
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,570
凯尔曼一家在这里生活的所有痕迹
every possible trace of the Kellmans' existence

948
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,000
并且全部替换成你的风格了
and replaced it with yours.

949
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,070
我现在要做的就是往冰箱里塞满西梅汁
Now all I have to do is fill the refrigerator with prune juice,

950
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,080
接着设置好...
and then I've got to set up the--

951
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,550
-好了  出去  -什么
- Okay, get out. - What?

952
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,860
出去是什么意思  我得设置好...
What do you mean get out? I haven't set up the--

953
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,970
她把车停好了  她要到了
She's pulling up. She's here,

954
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,210
我不想让她看到我们呆在一起
and I don't want her to see us together

955
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,590
然后误会我们
and get the wrong idea.

956
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,930
-能产生什么误会  -好了  你难道还不懂吗  
- And exactly what idea is that? - Okay, don't you understand?

957
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,790
没有女人比得过你
No woman could compete with you,

958
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,940
只要她认为你我有一丝机会
if she thought there was even a chance

959
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,370
成为情侣
of you and I being together.

960
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,700
-真的吗  -假的  她完爆你十条街
- Really? - No, she blows you away.

961
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,970
现在  赶紧给我出去  从便门走
Now, get the hell out, and use the service entrance.

962
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,240
塔拉  你来啦
Tara, you're here.

963
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,750
天呐
Oh, my God.

964
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,650
路易  这里真是太美了
Louis, this place is wonderful.

965
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,930
你拥有这套房子多久了
How long have you had it?

966
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,000
世代都住在这里  我曾祖母
Had it for generations. Great-grandma Litt,

967
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,170
常常在炉火边织毛衣
she used to make wool right over there by the fire.

968
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,470
这里的采光真是太完美了
The natural light is phenomenal.

969
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,380
完美
Phenomenal.

970
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,530
窗外的景色充斥着野性之美
And there's a wildness to the landscape,

971
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,120
和自由自在的气息
an uninhibited energy.

972
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,120
野性  自由自在
Wild. Uninhibited.

973
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,400
这里太适合我们了  路易
It's perfect for us, Louis.

974
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,100
很高兴你喜欢
I'm glad you like it.

975
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,590
不止喜欢  我是爱这里
I don't just like it. I love it.

976
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,410
正如我爱你一样
Just like I love you.

977
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,830
塔拉  我爱你...
Oh, Tara, I love you--

978
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,140
-什么  -的主意
- What? - It.

979
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,080
你的主意...就是你之前说的那个
Your idea...what you were talking about earlier.

980
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,490
-什么主意  -发生什么了
- Which idea? - What happened?

981
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,660
路易  你没事吧
Louis, are you okay?

982
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,390
这是怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

983
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,060
什么事都没有
Nothing's going on here.

984
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,470
你们跑到我家来干什么
What the hell are you doing in my house?

985
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,430
-你家吗  -路易  他们是谁
- Your house? - Louis, who are these people?

986
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,060
你说的他们就是这套房的
These people are the registered owners

987
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,600
登记持有人
of this property.

988
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,590
就是这套你说你们家
You mean the one you said had been

989
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,980
世世代代都住在这儿的房子吗
in your family for generations?

990
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,060
他说谎  我们亲手建的这套房
That's a lie. We built this house ourselves,

991
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,930
直到五分钟之前  我们还想卖给他的
and until five minutes ago, we were gonna sell it to him.

992
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,230
塔拉  听我解释
Tara, I can explain.

993
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,050
我不想听你解释  我已经听够了
I don't need you to explain. I've heard enough.

994
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,090
塔拉  请等一下
Tara, wait. Please.

995
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,490
塔拉  等一下
Tara, please wait.

996
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:44,130
你知道吗  我听说过你这样的人 
You know, I've heard about people like you.

997
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,040
你想从我这得到免费的设计建议
You're trying to get free design work out of me,

998
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,870
然后再决定要不要买这栋房子
so you can decide whether or not you want to buy this house.

999
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,880
事情完全不是这么回事
That has nothing to do with it.

1000
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,450
是吗  因为一开始
Really? Because, first,

1001
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,560
你就想让我开工
you tried to get me to work on this

1002
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,250
却又不带我看实物
without even seeing the space.

1003
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,020
然后又找借口把我骗到这来
Then you lured me out here under false pretenses.

1004
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,860
所以不如你来告诉我到底是怎么回事
So why don't you tell me what, exactly, is going on here?

1005
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,620
我对你撒谎说我在汉普顿斯有房子
I lied to you about owning a house in the Hamptons

1006
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,090
这样我就有机会多和你在一起
so I could spend time with you.

1007
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,030
什么  你为什么要这么做呢
What? Why--why would you do that?

1008
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,750
因为你如此的完美  漂亮
Because you are perfect, and beautiful,

1009
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,730
智慧而又有才华
and intelligent, and talented,

1010
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,300
而且我完全配不上
and so far out of my league.

1011
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,540
这是我唯一能想到的争取一些时间
It was the only thing that I can come up with to find the time

1012
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,600
让你爱上我的办法
I needed to make you fall for me.

1013
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,590
你竟然愿意为此买一栋房子并重新装修
You were willing to buy and remodel an entire house to do that?

1014
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,350
是的
I was.

1015
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,450
这是我听过最浪漫的事了
That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

1016
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:37,380
-真的吗  -是的  真的
- Really? - Yeah. Yes, really.

1017
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,180
塔拉  你愿意和我一起吃饭吗
Tara, would you like to have dinner with me?

1018
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,230
我很愿意  路易
I'd love to, Louis.

1019
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,720
你在忙什么
What are you working on?

1020
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,940
在处理一份委托书
An engagement letter.

1021
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,340
你找到了一个新客户
You got a new client.

1022
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,210
我给律所找了两个客户
I got us two new clients.

1023
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,460
这就是你前几天要处理的事
So that's what you had to do the other day.

1024
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,890
差不多吧
Well, something like that.

1025
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,570
前几天找到的客户今天又给我介绍了一个
The one I got the other day led to the one I got today.

1026
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,970
那很棒
That's great.

1027
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,580
是啊  你有什么事
Yeah, what's on your mind?

1028
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,630
我知道你说过这周晚些时候
I know you said that you'd give me

1029
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,080
你会抽出一个小时留给我
an hour of your time later this week,

1030
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,720
但我今天晚上就要用
but I need that hour tonight.

1031
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,630
瑞秋  今天我很累了
Rachel, it's been a long day.

1032
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,200
我们能早上再聊吗
Can we talk about this in the morning?

1033
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,760
不行杰西卡  我等不了了
No, Jessica, we can't.

1034
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,830
伦纳德・贝利的处决日期已经定下来了
Leonard Bailey's execution date's been set,

1035
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,760
我不知道要怎么跟一个人说他马上就要死了
and I don't know how to tell a man that he's going to die.

1036
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,280
你知道  我一直都清楚
You know, I always knew

1037
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,240
吉尔和我是不同世界的人 
that Jill and I were from two different worlds.

1038
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:55,430
她是萨特家的人  而我只是
And she was a Sutter, and I was just--

1039
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,570
一个只擅长与数字打交道
A guy who was good with numbers

1040
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,150
除此之外别无所长的人
and didn't have much else?

1041
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,170
原以为她明白这一点
Figured it was only a matter of time

1042
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,920
只是时间问题
before she came to her senses,

1043
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,580
但她从未后悔过
but she never did.

1044
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,220
我猜猜  威廉一直不接受你和吉尔在一起
Well, let me guess, William never accepted it.

1045
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,390
对  所以当他要求我开发那种算法
No. So when he asked me to develop that algorithm,

1046
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,100
我想  我的机会来了
I thought, "This is my chance."

1047
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,140
当我把算法给他时  他十分自豪
And when I gave it to him, he acted so proud.

1048
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,500
开始称我为他的乘龙快婿
Started calling me his genius son-in-law.

1049
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,280
但其实我只是世上最大的傻瓜
But I was really just the world's biggest sucker,

1050
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,610
因为我让那个混蛋骗了我
because I let that son of a bitch get one over on me,

1051
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,530
我余生都会为此后悔不已
and I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

1052
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,210
要是你也能骗他一次呢
What if you could get one over on him?

1053
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,100
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1054
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,130
你自己说过他们想跟你交易
You said yourself, they offered you a deal.

1055
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,570
我打赌他们仍然愿意接受
I bet they'd still take it.

1056
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,780
不可以  如果我把他抖出来
No way. If I give them him,

1057
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,100
他们会追查到吉尔
they go after her.

1058
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,830
如果你让他们先给吉尔豁免权就不会了
Not if you get them to give Jill immunity first.

1059
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,930
-不行  -凯文  你必须这么做
- No. - Kevin, you have to--

1060
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,510
这太冒险了
It's too big a risk,

1061
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,060
而且你还是我岳父的律师
and you're my father-in-law's lawyer.

1062
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,190
你不该说这种话
You can't be saying this.

1063
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,160
我谁的律师也不是
I am nobody's lawyer,

1064
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,780
我是你的朋友  我只是说
I am your friend. And I am saying--

1065
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,190
我说不行  我要你现在保证
Well, my answer's no, and I want your word, right now,

1066
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,940
你不会把我跟你说的告诉别人
that you won't tell anyone what I told you.

1067
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,500
-拜托凯文  你别  -迈克  我说真的
- Kevin, please, you're not-- - Mike, I'm serious.

1068
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,240
不许让别人知道我告诉你的事情
No one can ever know anything about what I told you.

1069
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,160
我向你保证
You have my word.

1070
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,250
我有跟你说过我妈妈是个老师吗
Did I ever tell you my mother was a teacher?

1071
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,190
一年级老师
First grade.

1072
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,820
人人都说她是他们孩子有过的
Everybody always said she was the best teacher

1073
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,500
最好的老师
their kid ever had.

1074
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,560
她也很开心
She loved it.

1075
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,040
她一直都梦想着退休后可以到西班牙去看看
She also always dreamed of seeing Spain when she retired.

1076
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,510
本来六年前就可以的
That was supposed to be six years ago,

1077
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,230
但当时的州立教师养老基金
but then the state teacher's pension fund

1078
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:54,400
决定把钱投给威廉・萨特
decided to invest its money with William Sutter

1079
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,100
她去年在工作中去世了
She died last year, still working.

1080
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,680
每一年  我都想花钱让她去旅行
And every year, I tried to pay for her trip,

1081
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,930
但她一直拒绝
but she just wouldn't let me.

1082
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,290
肖恩  你为什么跟我说这个
Sean, why are you telling me this?

1083
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,440
因为法官还是决定撤销你的案子了
Because a judge decided to rule on your motion to dismiss after all.

1084
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,450
这意味着我们没有时间了
Which means we're out of time,

1085
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,070
所以你来不是为了给我讲你母亲的故事的
and you didn't just come here to tell me about your mother.

1086
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,980
是的  我来问你要那个交易程序
No. I came here to ask for that trading program.
