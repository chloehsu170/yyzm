要不就是你女儿知道你戴了窃听器
or your daughter knew you were wearing a wire

107
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,040
从而误导你
and misled you.

108
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,890

109

What? What's wrong?

125
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,240
-你能帮我拖住他吗  -好
- Will you keep him occupied? - Okay.

126
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,260
亨利...  你真的不来一杯吗

127
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,090
不  我觉得这对我保释没什么好处
No, I don't think it's a good idea with my bail.

128
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,160

钱的问题  爸

我们得谈谈

对

143
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,290
但再谈一次
But once more.

144
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,950
等我们想开诚布公时告诉我一声  爸
Tell me when we're being honest, Dad,

145
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,720
我会愿意说实话的
and I'll be sure to switch over.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,280
你不相信我
You didn't trust me.

147
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,950
你上次向我说了谎
You told me a lie last time.

148
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,230
你们公司根本没有受贿
There was no bribery at your firm.

149
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,740

这就是场闹剧  爸
This is a farce, Dad.

151
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,190
你戴了窃听器
You were wearing a wire.

152
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,670
我对你说谎是事出有因的
If I told you a lie, there was a reason.

153
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,380
让我们来场父女间的谈话  好吗
Talk to me like I'm your daughter, okay?

154
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,780
我就在这里
I am right here.

155
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,460
不是你想的那样
It's not what you think.

156
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,780
怎么不是了
Why isn't it?

157
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,990
好了
Okay.

158
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,370

Here we are.

159
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,010
我这样做不是为了自保
I'm not doing this to save my skin.

160
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,200
他们冲着你来了
They're coming after you.

161
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,350
为什么
For what?

162
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,000
基金
The foundation.

163
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,600
你在转移基金的文件上签了字
Your signature on the transferred funds.

164
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,640
那是伪造的
They were forged.

165
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,530
亲爱的  我觉得他们不会这样认为
Honey, I don't think they'll believe that.

166
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,200
你是说  你录下我们的谈话
You're saying you were recording our conversations

167
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
用它来对付我的律所
and using them against my law firm

168
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,400
是明显在为我好吗
out of some clear concern for me?

169
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,380
没错
Yes.

170
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,790
联调局威胁说要起诉你
The Feds are threatening to prosecute you.

171
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,110
-他们在撒谎  -他们没有
- They're lying. - No, they're not.

172
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,040
我的天  那就别他妈利用我
Oh, my God, then don't fucking use me

173
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,140
来消除你的愧疚感  爸爸

174
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,320
你想为自己做笔交易  那就去
You want to make a deal for yourself, do it.

175
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,820
别说是为了我
Don't do it for me.

176
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,360
他们在你律师的录音里找到了那段谎言
They discovered the lie on your lawyer's recording.

177
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,360
他们知道贿赂的事是杜撰的了
They found out the bribery was made up.

178
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,460
我为什么要相信你  爸爸

179
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,340
因为
Because in, um,

180

181
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,980
你的合伙人们就会收到传票
your partners will be subpoenaed.

182
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,250
明天他们就会被拉到大陪审团前面
Tomorrow they'll be dragged in front of the grand jury.

183
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,470
克里斯特瓦不在乎能否定罪
Kresteva doesn't care about a conviction.

184
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,180
他只想要一张起诉书
All he wants is an indictment

185
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,750
就能毁了你们律所
to destroy your firm.

186
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,480
有五种法式酱料必不可缺
There are five essential French sauces.

187
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,980
如果想学做法国菜
If you are to learn French cuisine,

188
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,730
这些酱料就是基础
these are foundational.

189
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,180
这个奶酱做得很不错  阿德里安
Now, that is a beautiful velouté, Adrian.

190

大家都过来看看阿德里安的成果
Everyone, come and look at Adrian's work here.

192
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,810
你们都要向他学习
This is what you want to imitate.

193
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,920
-博斯曼先生  -是我
- Mr. Boseman. - Oui.

194
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,740

我很高兴你打给了我
I'm glad you called me.

196
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,600
我昨天还在想大学时候的事
I was thinking about college just yesterday.

197
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,910
我们要怎么征服世界
How we were gonna rule the world...

198
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,040
你基本上已经做到了  不是吗
Which you basically did, didn't you?

199
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,090
有什么特色菜吗
Are there any specials?

200
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,750
不知道  我没看宣传牌
I don't know. I didn't see the board.

201
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,900
我不是你服务生
I'm not your waiter.

202
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,270
芭芭拉·科斯达  你被传唤了
Barbara Kolstad, you've been served.

203
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,190
八位合伙人  四名律师被传唤
Eight partners subpoenaed, four associates.

204
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,790
他没查到什么
He's got nothing on us.

205
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,070
他没法立案
He has no case.

206
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,350
他不需要立案  芭芭拉
He doesn't need one, Barbara.

207
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,300
他还是能把我们拖到大陪审团面前
He'll still drag us in front of the grand jury,

208
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,730
大喊几声「反诈骗腐败组织集团犯罪法」
scream "RICO."

209
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,400
不管怎样他都能拿到起诉书
He gets his indictment no matter what.

210
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,810
-我同意  -你同意吗
- I agree. - You do?

211
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,180
是的
Yes.

212
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,820
大陪审团总会选择起诉
Grand juries always indict.

213
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,030
除非是警方施暴案
Unless it's a police brutality case.

214
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,690
除此之外还有个问题是
And then there's the additional problem

215
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,460
克里斯特瓦不相信那个受贿故事了
that Kresteva no longer believes our bribery story.

216
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,760
所以我们要怎么做
So what do we do?

217
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,910
他要的不是定罪
Well, he doesn't want a conviction.

218
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,080
我喜欢这耳环  尤其喜欢这形状

希望我也能戴这种耳环

没错  抱歉  你太棒了
Right. Sorry. You're amazing.

223
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,880
他想让你们破产
Um, he wants to bankrupt you.

224
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,180
没错  我接到了佩斯里集团的电话
Right. I got a call from the Paisley Group.

225
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,840
昨天有联邦探员过去
There was a federal agent over there yesterday

226
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
问了一些关于我们的问题
asking questions about us.

227
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,400
他想吓跑我们的客户

228
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,670
怎么了
What?

229
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,370
-怎么  -不  我说你怎么了
- What? - No, you. What?

230
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,330
-你本想说些什么的  -不  我只是
- You were about to say something. - No, I just...

231
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,120
我不知道这有没有用
I'm not sure if this helps,

232
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,070
但克里斯特瓦的上司
but Kresteva's boss,

233
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,570
助理总检察长
the assistant attorney general,

234
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,800
在担心这调查显得有些

235
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,690
种族歧视
racist.

236
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,230
你怎么知道的
How do you know that?

237
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,030
我只是知道而已

238

这样可行
That's a possibility.

239
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,490
什么可行
What's a possibility?

240
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,900
我不太想直接说出来
Uh, well, I don't want to say it.

241
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,030
我们是非裔美国人的律所
We're an African-American firm

242
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,740
被一个大多为白人的部门起诉
being persecuted by a majority white department?

243
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,760
你想让我们把回答引到种族问题上来吗
You want us to turn our answers toward race?

244
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,740
没错
Yes.

245
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,060
阻止被起诉的唯一办法

246
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,880
是停掉大陪审团
is to close down the grand jury.

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,660
而停掉大陪审团的唯一办法
And the only way to close down the grand jury

248
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,920
是说服助理总检察长威尔伯·丁肯

249
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,240
这事对他没好处
it's not in his interest.

250
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,030
而要说服他这事对他没好处的唯一办法
And the only way to convince him it's not in his interest

251
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,440
就是把回答引导到种族的问题上来

252
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,630
没错  我们只有一个观众  威尔伯·丁肯

253
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,350
芭芭拉  你觉得呢
Barbara, what do you think?

254
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,690
打种族的牌吗
About using race?

255
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,120
那这就是种族的问题了
Well, it is about race.

256

阿德里安·博斯曼

被「美国律师」誉为国内前十的

黑人律所

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,710
你说完了吗
You finished?

262
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,040
说完了
Yeah.

263
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,640
博斯曼先生  你在芝加哥当了多久的律师

我由哈罗德·华盛顿市长宣誓入职

266
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,870
他是市里首位也是唯一一位黑人市长

267
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,060
其实我口袋里都还揣着张他的照片
I actually keep a photograph of him in my pocket just to

268
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,880
时刻提醒着我

你会同意说  起诉芝加哥警局
Would you agree that suing the Chicago Police Department

273
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,070
是你们律所的主要收益流吗

274
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,080
我同意我们的律所
I agree that our firm,

275
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,790
是一家由非裔美国人多数参股的律所

276
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,190
女士  我并没有问贵所的种族成分
Ma'am, I didn't ask about your racial makeup.

277
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,650
是的  但是你让我用自己的话来表达的
Yes, but you did ask me to answer in my own words,

278
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,280
这就是我的话啊
and these are my own words.

279

谢谢

281
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,290
就像我说的

282
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,240
作为一家由非裔美国人拥有的律所

283
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,110
{\an8}威尔伯·丁肯

"某些受害者会觉得到我们律所来

285
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,220
比去由白人控股的律所更舒服

提问  "再说一遍  这跟种族无关  女士"

288
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,750
而语境里就包含我们律所的种族成分"

289
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,040
什么情况
What the hell is going on?

290
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,450
你本应该跟种族不沾边的
You were supposed to stay away from race.

291
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,620
我们没沾  不是我们提出来的  是他们
We are. We're not the ones taking it there, they are.

292
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,740
我不管谁提的

293

这事看上去像迫害了
It's looking like a persecution.

294
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,660
是策略
It's a tactic.

295

那就绕过它
Well, then, go around it.

296
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,760
你必须澄清此案跟种族无关
You need to make it clear that this is not about race.

297

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,140
"来生  我愿做一条鲨鱼"

Great. Makes sense to me.

307
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,240
梅丽莎·戈德  对吧

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,710
不  来生  我愿做一条鲨鱼
No. Nella mia prossima vita voglio essere uno squalo.

309
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,950

所以  他在转移话题
So, he's pivoting?

正确  不能再说黑人律师了

312
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,310
现在  他冲着你们三个来
Now, he's going after you three.

313
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,260
为什么
For what?

314
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,190
我不知道
I don't know.

是的  威尔伯·丁肯正在关注此案

我们如何利用这一点呢
So, how do we exploit that?

321
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,010
咱们想想吧
Well, let's think.

322
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,750
咱们......
Let's...

323
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
我们不想让哪个大陪审团的人将事情联系起来
So, we don't want a grand jury to connect the dots.

324
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,590
我们想要的是一个有意义的案子
What we want is a case that makes sense...

325
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,260
如果没有事实支撑的话  我们没法定罪
we won't get a conviction unless the facts hold up.

326
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,340
我们稍后再考虑这个
Let's worry about this later.

327
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,010
大陪审团很感情用事
Grand juries work off of emotion.

328
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,720
首先  我们需要起诉书
First, we need an indictment.

329
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,530
我们需要有事实支撑的起诉书
Well, we need an indictment based on facts.

330
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,680
你好
Uh, hello?

331
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,850
你想做什么
Do you need something?

332
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,040
你知道我每发一封传票能挣多少钱吗
Do you know how much I make for every subpoena I deliver?

333
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,010
不知道
No idea,

334
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,550
但是我确定你可以跟治安官办公室里聊聊这事
but I'm sure you can talk to the sheriff's office about this.

335
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,570
47美元
$47.

336
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,080
很好  真棒
Great. Good to know.

337
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,710
过去的48小时过得真的特别棒
And this has been a really good 48 hours.

338
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,200
你被传唤了
You've been served.

339
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,770
迈克  你好吗
Mike, how are you?

340
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,820
你回来了
You're back.

341
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,610
你好  塔肖尼女士
Hello, Miss Tascioni.

342
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,530
你贪多嚼不烂了
You have bitten off way more than you can chew.

343
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,330
是吗  我挺能嚼的呢
Really? I can chew a lot.

344
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,480
你在民事法庭对我提起诉讼
You're suing me in civil court?

345
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,800
是的  因为侵权干涉合约关系
Yes, for tortious interference with contractual relations.

346
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,870
我觉得挺聪明的
I thought that was clever.

347
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,630
你不会真这么觉得吧
You don't believe it?

348
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,410
我就像你相信大陪审团一样相信这个
I believe it the same way you do your grand jury.

349
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,640
在你们被起诉的同时
No court will allow you to sue me

350
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,510
没有法庭会允许你起诉我
at the same time that you're being prosecuted.

351
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,700
也许你是说得对  迈克
Maybe you're right, Mike.

352
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,500
你吃不吃无无花果软糖
Hmm. Do you want a fig bar?

353
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,560
不吃
No.

354
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,250
也许你说得对
Maybe you're right that 

355
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,460
没有哪个法庭会让我的诉讼继续下去
no court will allow my suit to go forward,

356
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,490
但是你打电话告诉我就行了
but you could've told me that on the phone.

357
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,200
相反  你来我这了
Instead, you came over here.

358
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,850
当然  随时欢迎
And you're welcome anytime.

359
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,080
我们法庭见
I'll see you in court.

360
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,300
两个庭
Both courts.

361
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,730
咱们走着瞧  看哪个先结束
We'll see which one finishes first.

362
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,000
放那堆文件的最上面的话
Putting something on top of the pile

363
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,870
可是让我把它挪到最下面的最好办法了
is a great way to get me to move it to the bottom.

364
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,960
我认为博斯曼先生不会喜欢这个做法
I don't think Mr. Boseman would like that.

365
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,990
这是什么
What is this?

366
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,640
不知道
No idea.

367
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,740
这是跟林德尔庞氏骗局案相关的东西
It's something regarding the Rindell Ponzi scheme.

368
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,590
这些是「财富」500强名单
Well, these are Fortune 500 names.

369
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,730
并不全
Not all of them,

370
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,580
只是一部分
but some.

371
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,010
但是你看看这些数字
But look at these numbers here.

372
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,290
九位数  代表什么
Nine digit numbers. What are they?

373
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,100
不知道  社保账号
No idea. Social Security numbers?

374
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,110
不是  我查过了
No, I checked.

375
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,870
好吧
Okay.

376
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,360
勾起了我的好奇心
My curiosity is whetted.

377
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,800
我也是  我喜欢神秘的东西
Me, too. I like mysteries.

378
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,270
你能查出来
Could you find out

379
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,010
这份名单能如何打击到这家律所吗
how this list might come back to hurt this firm?

380
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,060
确定它不利于我们吗
Are we sure it will?

381
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,030
确定
Oh, yes.

382
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,310
克里斯特瓦先生费尽心机想得到它
Mr. Kresteva worked too hard to get it.

383
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,600
好的  我会查一查的
Okay. I'll take a look.

384
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,410
谢谢
Thank you.

385
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,740
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding?

386
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,830
没有  我要把你加进来  孩子
No. I'm putting you in, kid.

387
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,630
长官  别...
Sir, please. It's not...

388
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,530
我讨厌他
I hate him.

389
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,540
我明白了
Oh, I see.

390
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,260
你是不是错误地认为
Are you under the mistaken impression

391
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,690
你只会为你喜欢的人辩护
that you only defend people you like?

392
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,310
不是  我错误地认为
No, I'm under the mistaken impression

393
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,030
我不为任何人辩护  我是一名检察官
I don't defend anyone. I'm a prosecutor.

394
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,130
是啊  好吧
Yeah, well, 

395
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,760
什么时候你能让这个扯淡的侵权干涉案子撤案
when you get this tortious interference nonsense dismissed, 

396
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,400
你就能继续回来做检察官
you can go back to prosecuting.

397
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:14,900
长官  我得告诉你此事与我有利益冲突
Sir. I have to... apprise you of a conflict of interest.

398
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,550
什么利益冲突
And what's that?

399
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,760
我在和原告律所的一名律师约会
I'm dating one of the lawyers at the plaintiff's firm.

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,960
明白了
I see.

401
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,170
这不是一件好事
That's not good.

402
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,860
是的  我不确定自己能否保持客观
Yeah, I'm, uh, not sure that I could be... objective.

403
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,820
我同意
I agree.

404
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,300
不要和她约会了
Stop dating her.

405
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,070
然后你就能保持客观了
Then you can be.

406
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,530
你上庭要迟到了
You're late for court.

407
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,380
{\an8}凯尔·伽洛法官

408
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,090
老天  其他人呢
Jesus Christ, where is everybody?

409
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,600
现在已经上午十点了  是吗
It's 10 A.M. Am I right?

410
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,290
没错  法官阁下  原告方已经就绪
You are right, Your Honor. The plaintiffs are ready.

411
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,090
很好  别拍我马屁
Good for you. Stop kissing my ass.

412
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,880
-被告呢  -我来了  法官阁下
- Where's the defense? - I'm here, Your Honor.

413
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,350
你迟到了  你让我在这傻等
You're late. You had me waiting.

414
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,710
很抱歉  法官阁下
My apologies, Your Honor. 

415
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,070
我刚被指派接手这个案子
I was just assigned this case.

416
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,980
关我屁事
I don't give a shit.

417
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,860
我们十点开始  你就得十点到
We start at 10:00, you're here at 10:00.

418
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,000
今天是什么案子  侵权干涉
What do we have today? Tortious interference.

419
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,060
是的  法官阁下  这间律所...
Yes, Your Honor. This law firm...

420
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,990
我们请求立即撤案 
We ask for an immediate motion to dismiss.

421
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,000
住嘴
Stop it.

422
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,990
你先说  迟到先生
You first, Mr. Late.

423
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,860
被告动议撤案
Uh, the defense moves to dismiss.

424
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,440
克里斯特瓦先生正在进行一场大陪审团调查
Mr. Kresteva is in the middle of an active Grand Jury Investigation.

425
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,850
发起这些诉讼是想对此事
Initiating these proceedings

426
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,240
进行干扰  这是损人利己的做法
is a cynical attempt to interfere with that.

427
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,690
强烈反对
Vehemently disagree.

428
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,660
阿德里安
Adrian.

429
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,850
早上好  法官阁下
Good morning, Your Honor.

430
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,720
克里斯特瓦先生的大陪审团调查...
Mr. Kresteva's Grand Jury Investigation...

431
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,970
反对  法官阁下
Objection, Your Honor.

432
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,990
他是律师还是原告
Is he the lawyer or the plaintiff?

433
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,180
原告
The plaintiff.

434
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,210
那他不应该在法庭之上进行辩护
Well, then, he shouldn't be arguing in court.

435
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,830
他应该作为证人被传召
He should be called as a witness.

436
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,480
那我想传召阿德里安·博斯曼先生作为证人上庭
Oh. Then, I'd like to call Mr. Adrian Boseman as a witness.

437
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,270
不行  打断一下  不行  不...
No, excuse me, no. No. Uh... uh,

438
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,310
法官阁下  你还没有听我的撤案动议
Your Honor, you never heard on my motion to dismiss.

439
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,690
是  但你刚让他们让他作为证人出庭
Yeah, but you just told them to put him on the stand.

440
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,760
不  我说他不应该在法庭上进行辩护
No, I-I said he shouldn't be arguing in court.

441
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,830
辩护方在利用这个民事权利...
The defense is using this civil action...

442
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,880
"原告"  你应该指的是这个吧
"The plaintiff"? Is that the word you're looking for?

443
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,270
是的
Yes.

444
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,390
原告...
The plaintiff...

445
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,990
利用这个民事诉讼  妄图发现点什么
is using this civil action as a poor man's discovery.

446
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,710
他们没有机会进入我们的大陪审团房间
They don't have access to our Grand Jury room,

447
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,290
于是他们试图利用这个法庭去试探...
so they are using this court as a way to find out...

448
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,370
大陪审团的动态
uh, what's going on in the grand jury room.

449
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,890
这是你们的企图吗  律师
Is that what you were doing, counselor?

450
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,670
不是  法官阁下
No, Your Honor.

451
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,260
我要是有这么聪明就好了
I wish I were that smart.

452
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,040
这个主意不错
Good idea.

453
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,660
好吧  反对无效  传唤你的证人
Okay, overruled, call your witness.

454
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,110
埃尔斯贝特
Elsbeth.

455
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,780
让我做你的次席律师
Make me your second chair.

456
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,010
为什么
Why?

457
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,130
因为这是个好主意
Because it's a good idea.

458
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,640
博斯曼先生  为什么你要起诉他们侵权干涉
Mr. Boseman, why are you suing for tortious interference?

459
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,900
我们的客户在流失
We're losing clients.

460
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,680
上两个星期我们失去了三名客户
Three clients in the past two weeks.

461
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,720
为什么这个案子现在开审对你很重要
And why is it important that this case be heard now? 

462
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,300
因为这个大陪审团就是我们客户流失的原因
Because this Grand Jury is the reason we're losing clients.

463
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,310
克里斯特瓦先生并不是想要定罪
Mr. Kresteva doesn't want a conviction.

464
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,560
他想要我们破产
He wants our bankruptcy.

465
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,250
反对  引导证人推测
Objection. Speculation.

466
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,520
这个反对只能对我的问题有效
Uh, that's a proper objection for a question,

467
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,780
但对回答无效
not for a response.

468
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,760
如果莫雷洛先生有反证证人
If Mr. Morrello has a rebuttal witness, 

469
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,740
他应该让他出庭
he should present him.

470
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,090
我同意  反对无效
I would agree. Overruled.

471
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,060
博斯曼先生
Mr. Boseman, 

472
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,270
有客户向你解释了他们离开的原因吗
did any of your clients explain why they were leaving?

473
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,590
有  佩斯利集团说
Yes. The Paisley Group said

474
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,650
联邦探员到他们的工作地点
federal agents came to their workplace

475
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,960
盘问我们的工作
questioning them about our work.

476
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,410
他们不想惹麻烦
They didn't want the hassle.

477
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,910
你认为这是克里斯特瓦先生的干涉行为
And you think this was an intentional move 

478
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,410
导致的吗
on Mr. Kresteva's part?

479
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,170
-反对  -当然
- Objection. - Absolutely.

480
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,930
这次也是引导证人推测
This time calls for speculation.

481
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,810
瞧瞧  你能做出合理反对了
Look at you, making a proper objection.

482
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,850
反对有效
Sustained.

483
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,200
我没有问题了  法官阁下
Nothing further, Your Honor.

484
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,140
我问完了  莫雷洛先生
Your witness, Mr. Morrello.

485
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,960
谢谢  奎因女士
Thank you, Ms. Quinn.

486
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,920
你失去的这三位客户
These three clients you lost,

487
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,120
他们对你们的财务影响有多大
how important were they to your bottom line?

488
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,690
每位客户都非常重要
Every client is important.

489
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,130
这听起来并没有很重要
Hmm. That sounds like not very important.

490
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,520
反对  非常牵强  有争议
Objection. Lamely argumentative.

491
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,730
对  在我看来也是
Yeah, no, it sounded that way to me, too.

492
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,640
这三位客户的离开
How much money a year do you lose

493
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,030
使你一年损失了多少钱
from losing these three clients?

494
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,490
我想  130万美元
I guess... $1.3 million.

495
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,760
但我们不能再这样下去了  法官阁下
But that's why we need to stop this leakage now, Your Honor.

496
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,210
你们不是刚刚和查查网签约了吗
And didn't you just sign Chumhum, 

497
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,050
一个社交媒体巨头  
a massive social media empire 

498
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,350
每年可以向你的律所贡献8600万美元
worth $86 million a year to you?

499
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,550
-是的  -那么  130万美元
- Yes, we did. - So... $1.3 million

500
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,150
对比8600万美元
versus $86 million.

501
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,080
二者并无关联
Those two things are not connected.

502
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,780
别在这哭穷
Whah-whah-whah-whah, don't cry poverty in here!

503
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,720
我们不是在哭穷
Oh, we're not crying poverty.

504
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,550
奎因女士很明显是想
Ms. Quinn clearly wants to avoid any oversight...

505
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,040
我们只是说司法部
We're just saying that the DOJ 

506
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,910
故意想将...
is intentionally trying to take something...

507
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,890
{\an8}每次搞点小偷小摸时
...by officials and every time they have their hands

508
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,620
都能逃过有关部门的监管
caught in the cookie jar...

509
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,550
不不不  你们两个  都回座位去
No, no, no. Both of you, back in your seats.

510
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,890
注意礼节
Decorum.

511
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,880
这是我一贯主张的
That's what I insist on.

512
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,050
抱歉  法官阁下
My apologies, Your Honor.

513
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,920
我能问个问题吗
May I ask a quick question?

514
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,960
可以  小声点儿
You may, quietly.

515
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,680
被告为什么不出庭呢
Why is the defendant not here?

516
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,400
我看到只有被告律师来了
I see that the defense sent its lawyer,

517
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,500
难道被告觉得这次庭审无足轻重
but does the defendant think so little of this court

518
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,570
才只派律师出庭吗
that he only sends his lawyer?

519
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,370
我相信原告律师知道原因
I believe the plaintiff's lawyer knows the reason.

520
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,840
被告正忙着大陪审团问询的事
The defendant is busy running a grand jury room.

521
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,370
这样啊  所以克里斯特瓦先生
I see. So, Mr. Kresteva 

522
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,160
抽不出空给伽洛法官对吗
is too busy for Judge Gallo?

523
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,610
你有解释我在主持大陪审团问询吗
Did you explain that I'm conducting a grand jury?

524
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,720
说了  可主审是伽洛法官  他讨厌被人轻视
I did. It's Judge Gallo. He doesn't like being dissed.

525
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,290
天哪  好吧  什么时候开庭
Dear God. Okay, when?

526
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,500
今天下午
This afternoon.

527
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,100
目前的情形正合他们意  你看出来了吧
This is playing right into their hands. You know that.

528
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,240
当然
I sure do.

529
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,310
那么  戈德女士
So, Ms. Gold,

530
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,350
你和戴安·洛哈特是什么关系呢
what is your relationship with Diane Lockhart?

531
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,960
她是我的老板
She's my boss.

532
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,470
-我还将她视为我的导师  -是吗
- Also, I consider her my mentor. -Really?

533
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,600
她教你什么了
What does she mentor you in?

534
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,690
自从进入非裔律所工作
Well, since coming to work at an African-American firm,

535
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,200
我得说是让我开始意识了到白人特权
I'd say it's becoming aware of the nature of white privilege.

536
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,220
你曾与洛哈特女士在她之前的律所共事过
And you worked with Ms. Lockhart at her previous firm,

537
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,620
-是吗  -没错
- did you not? - I did,

538
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,190
但那里绝对和非裔美国人没关系
but that was definitely not an African-American firm.

539
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,120
完全跟特朗普的白宫似的
It was like the Trump White House there.

540
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,230
戈德女士  我们不是在问
Ms. Gold, we're not asking

541
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,030
这家律所的种族问题
about the racial makeup of the firm.

542
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,620
不好意思
Oh, sorry. 

543
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,440
真敏感
Touchy.

544
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,660
你是否注意到
You were aware, were you not,

545
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,790
洛哈特女士在去阿德里安·博斯曼的律所前
that Ms. Lockhart had frequent meetings and phone calls

546
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,900
就和他有频繁会面及电话来往
with Adrian Boseman prior to going over to his firm?

547
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,990
有
Absolutely.

548
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,610
博斯曼先生的律所曾替一位
Mr. Boseman's firm was representing a young, African-American man

549
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,770
遭白人警官毒打的年轻美国黑人辩护
who had been pretty severely beaten by a white police officer...

550
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,280
再次申明  这与种族无关  女士
Again, this is not about race, ma'am.

551
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,550
我同意  不过是你们一直在问这方面问题
I agree, but you guys keep asking me about race.

552
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,700
那洛哈特女士是否向博斯曼先生透露过
Isn't it true that Ms. Lockhart slipped privileged information

553
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,790
这件案子的保密信息吗
to Mr. Boseman about this case?

554
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,490
你是指被白人警察毒打的黑人
You mean the case about this African-American kid

555
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,610
这个案子吗
being beaten up by the white cops?

556
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,890
不好意思  但是你先问的
I'm sorry, but you asked the question.

557
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,640
喂  戴安  我感觉进展很顺利
Hey, Diane. I think it went great.

558
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,870
好的
Uh, yeah.

559
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,130
好  我马上回去
Okay, I'm on my way back.

560
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,470
安德鲁·哈特
It's Andrew Hart.

561
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,350
他有什么把柄
What does he have on us?

562
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,630
为什么克里斯特瓦叫他来作证
Why is Kresteva calling him to testify?

563
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,980
他旁边有别人吗
Did you see him with anybody else?

564
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,950
-没  就他一个  -我们得弄清楚
- No, he was alone. - We need to find out

565
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,120
他对大陪审团都说了我们律所什么
what he said to the grand jury about our firm.

566
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,510
怎么弄清楚
How do we do that?

567
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,360
关于原告的律所  你是怎么对大陪审团说的
What did you say to the grand jury about the plaintiff's firm?

568
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,040
反对  大陪审团问询内容属于机密
Objection. Grand jury proceedings are under seal

569
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,400
不能公之于众  无论塔肖尼女士
and cannot be made public, no matter how clever

570
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,210
觉得自己有多聪明都不行
Ms. Tascioni thinks she is.

571
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,830
反对有效
Sustained.

572
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,900
太过奖了
That's sweet,

573
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,270
夸我聪明
complimenting me for being clever.

574
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,230
谢谢
Thank you.

575
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,230
很高兴见到你  克里斯特瓦先生
Nice to see you, Mr. Kresteva.

576
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,640
迪尔德拉好吗
Oh, how's Diedre?

577
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,780
她很好
Oh, she's fine.

578
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,750
嘿  这是法庭
Uh, hello? Civil court.

579
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,200
-纳税人的钱可一直烧着呢  -抱歉
- Taxpayers' money being spent. - Yes, sorry.

580
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,100
我是否可以说
Is it fair to say that 

581
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,300
为了获得竞争优势
in an effort to gain some competitive advantage,

582
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,310
你曾试图让阿德里安·博斯曼被取消律师资格呢
you sought to have Adrian Boseman disbarred?

583
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,060
是否可以  不可以
Is it fair? No, it's not fair.

584
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,350
知道了
I see. 

585
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,020
那是否可以说你试图劝说
Well, is it fair to say that you tried calling

586
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,170
{\an8}他是否想让我被吊销律师执照
他有没有联系我们的客户
他和谁联系过
多少客户

587
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,510
雷迪克&博斯曼律所的客户离开他们呢
Reddick & Boseman clients to steal them away?

588
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,410
不  也不能这么说
No, that's not fair, either.

589
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,330
一点也没有吗
Not even a little bit?

590
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,960
反对  法官阁下
Objection, Your Honor.

591
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,860
这是钓鱼盘问
This is a fishing expedition.

592
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,480
是吗
Yes?

593
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,810
就是...
It's...

594
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,780
我说的这样
...what I said.

595
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,670
塔肖尼女士  你到底想干吗
Ms. Tascioni, where is this going?

596
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,210
我只有几个问题要问了
I just have a few more questions.

597
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,870
你是否与雷迪克&博斯曼律所的客户见面
Did you ever meet with Reddick & Boseman clients

598
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,120
好挖走他们呢  可以这么说吗
in order to steal them away? Is that fair?

599
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,070
我所做的一切都在法律范围之内
I have not done anything illegal.

600
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,990
我没问这个
That's not my question.

601
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,360
你是否与雷迪克&博斯曼律所的客户见面
Did you ever meet with Reddick & Boseman clients

602
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,540
好挖走他们呢
with the direct intent of stealing them?

603
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,430
{\an8}哪个客户

604
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,380
我只是做了任何生意人都会做的事
I did what any business would do.

605
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,380
哪位客户呢  哈特先生
Which client, Mr. Hart?

606
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,190
反对  与本案无关
Objection. Relevance?

607
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,860
他们只不过想证明证人对大陪审团
They're just trying to establish that the witness is feeding

608
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,520
透露了不利信息
negative info to the grand jury, 

609
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,900
这样他就能挖走他们的客户了
so he can steal their clients.

610
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,430
没错  法官阁下
Exactly, Your Honor.

611
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,240
女士  我知道你习惯大声说话了
Ma'am, you're an acquired taste,

612
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,290
但我还没习惯  所以
and I don't think I've acquired it yet, so... shh.

613
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,810
请回答问题
Please answer the question.

614
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,870
我同一位叫施皮格尔的先生吃了午餐
I met for lunch with a Mr. Spiegel,

615
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,590
他经营连锁百货商店
who owns a string of department stores.

616
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,720
去找施皮格尔  哈特想挖走他
Get to Spiegel. Hart's trying to poach him.

617
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,690
你心情很不好吗
Are you in a pissy mood?

618
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,730
没有
No.

619
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,250
那晚上来我家吧
Then come by tonight.

620
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,680
有人让我和你分手
I've been told to break up with you.

621
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,800
有人
You've been told?

622
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
真的吗
Really?

623
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,400
那你最好照做咯
Then you'd better do it.

624
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,120
不然你会被炒的
You're going to get fired.

625
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,570
反正我也讨厌这工作
Mm, I hate my job, anyway.

626
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,250
施皮格尔先生  最近好吗
Mr. Spiegel, how are you?

627
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,170
不错
Good.

628
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,050
我想既然是你打电话给我的
I hope since you called me

629
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,760
那我应该不会要付钱吧
I'm not getting billed for this.

630
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,520
计时器停了
Meter's off.

631
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,690
我们这周安排和一些客户聊了聊
We're sitting down with some of our clients this week.

632
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,600
只是想确定没有忽视任何事
We just want to make sure we're not missing anything,

633
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,690
客户的需求都得到了满足
their needs are being met...

634
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,570
以及没人弃船而去吗
And no one's jumping ship?

635
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,790
当下有人针对我们律所的进行抹黑  安东尼
There's a smear campaign against our firm, Anthony.

636
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,160
我想澄清一下谣言
I want to set the record straight.

637
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,690
你想知道谁在我耳边打小报告
You want to know who's been whispering in my ear.

638
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,910
如果让我猜一下
If I were to guess,

639
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,450
我觉得近期应该是安迪·哈特
I'd say lately it's coming from Andy Hart.

640
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,190
你猜得没错
You'd be right.

641
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,320
介意告诉我他说了什么吗
Mind telling me what he said?

642
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,860
他警告我说
He warned me

643
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,180
雷迪克&博斯曼正被卷入一场大风暴之中
that Reddick/Boseman was in the path of a major storm.

644
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,920
说我要是明智的话
And that I would be wise

645
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,860
应该现在开始物色其他律所了
to seek other representation.

646
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,760
他有没有提到什么关于大陪审团
Did he say anything about a grand jury

647
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,630
已经组成的事情
having been impaneled?

648
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,710
反对
Objection.

649
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,400
法官阁下  我并没有问大陪审团
Your Honor, I'm not asking about the content

650
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,580
问询的具体内容
of the grand jury proceeding.

651
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,500
我只是想知道  哈特先生有没有用
All I want to know is, did Mr. Hart use the fact

652
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,580
他要在大陪审团面前作证这一事实
that he testified before the grand jury

653
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,990
来窃取雷迪克&博斯曼的客户
to steal Reddick/Boseman clients?

654
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,910
对窃取这一措辞提出反对
Objection as to stealing.

655
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,680
能让我完整说完一句话而不进行反对吗
Can I get out one statement without an objection?

656
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,720
当然可以  只要你不用"窃取"这样
Sure, just don't use loaded words

657
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,500
有暗示意味的字眼
like "stealing."

658
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,060
好吧  这两个反对
Okay, which one of your objections 

659
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,290
你希望我先裁决哪一个  律师
would you like me to rule on first, counselor?

660
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,220
第一  第二个吧
The fir... uh, the second.

661
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,430
反对无效
Overruled.

662
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,540
你现在想听听我对第一个反对的裁决吗
Would you like to hear about the first one now?

663
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,880
同样反对无效
Overruled.

664
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,750
先生  哈特先生有提到他的证词吗
Sir, did Mr. Hart mention his testimony?

665
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,510
没有
No.

666
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,540
谢谢
Thank you.

667
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,940
因为他当时还没出席作证
Because he hadn't testified yet.

668
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,240
你是什么时候和哈特先生会面的
Uh, when was it that you met with Mr. Hart?

669
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,350
两周前
Two weeks ago.

670
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:20,600
他当时有提到大陪审团将就位进行问询吗
And did he mention that a grand jury would be impaneled?

671
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,900
据我回忆
As I recall, 

672
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,900
那是他整场游说的核心要点
it was the centerpiece of his presentation.

673
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,900
我想提请法庭注意
I would direct the court's attention

674
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,690
{\an8}汤姆·C·戈登来电

675
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,710
这一事件发生在除了克里斯特瓦先生
to the fact that this would've been

676
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,370
办公室里的员工以外任何人都无法得知
before anyone outside of Mr. Kresteva's office

677
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,070
将会有一次大陪审团问询之前
would have known about a grand jury.

678
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,220
奎因女士到底是在询问一位证人还是在作证
Is Ms. Quinn questioning a witness or testifying?

679
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,030
我只是想指出显而易见的事实
I'm just pointing out the obvious.

680
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,410
我最喜爱的诉讼投资人近来如何呀
How are my favorite litigation financiers?

681
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,770
很不好  博斯曼先生
Not good, Mr. Boseman.

682
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,810
我们刚刚被传唤要在大陪审团前作证
We just got subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury.

683
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,180
该死的
Oh, shit.

684
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,960
诉讼投资人
Litigation financiers.

685
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,370
真是个有意思的头衔
What an interesting title.

686
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,270
你俩在哪上的法学院
Where'd you guys go to law school? 

687
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,580
我们没读过法律
We didn't.

688
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,280
那你们能解释一下你们是如何直接参与到
Then can you explain how you've been directly involved

689
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,890
超过75起民事案件中的吗
in over 75 civil cases?

690
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,210
我们为律所提供融资服务
We provide financing to law firms 

691
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,140
以便让他们在短时间内手头有大笔官司时
that allows them to cover operating costs

692
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,240
获取周转资金来支付必要的运营成本
while undertaking time-intensive legal battles.

693
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,220
比如像雷迪克&博斯曼这间律所
Law firms like Reddick/Boseman.

694
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,540
你们为多少个案子提供了资金支持
How many of their cases have you bankrolled?

695
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,790
-21个  -不
- Twenty-one. - No. 

696
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,730
是23个
23.

697
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,190
你是怎么算的
Wha... how do you figure?

698
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,900
还有那次上诉和圣诞节的庭外和解
The appeal and the Christmas settlement.

699
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,660
不  是21个
No, that's 21.

700
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,110
不对  21加2是23
No, 21 plus two is 23.

701
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,640
就是21个
It's 21 period.

702
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,750
好了  先别管是21还是23了
Okay, let's leave it at 21 or 23.

703
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,100
雷迪克&博斯曼律所为你们提供什么
What does Reddick/Boseman give you

704
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,440
作为融资的回报呢
in return for this financing?

705
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,990
我们约定将庭外和解金额的一部分作为报酬
An agreed upon percentage of the settlement amount.

706
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,690
我假定雷迪克&博斯曼律所支付给你们的是
Well, I assume Reddick/Boseman

707
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,950
他们从庭外和解总金额中所获佣金的一部分
pays you your percentage out of theirs.

708
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,810
你是真的这么假定还是你只是想
Do you really assume that or are you just trying

709
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,050
通过说你假定来表达一个观点
to make a point by saying you assume it?

710
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,420
报酬百分比是按什么计算的  华少夫斯基先生
Where does the percentage come from, Mr. Warshofsky?

711
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,550
是23  不是21
It's 23, not 21.

712
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,120
好了  杰瑞  就
Okay, Jerry, j-just...

713
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,080
按照如果没有我们投资  委托人根本收不到的
From the client's percentage of money he never would've seen

714
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,330
那笔和解金中的一定百分比计算
if it weren't for the money we invested.

715
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,430
谢谢
Thank you.

716
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,520
在2月20日  就在达成庭外和解之前
On February 20, just before the settlement,

717
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,280
你们二位决定通过继续往此案中注资的方式
you gentlemen decided to increase your stake in the case

718
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,730
提高你们投资的分成比例  为什么会这么做
by investing more money. Why was that?

719
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,330
博斯曼先生非常自信他们将
Mr. Boseman was confident they'd

720
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,860
争取到500万美元的赔偿金
come in north of five million.

721
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,990
他有告诉你们他这么有信心的依据是什么吗
Did he tell you the basis for this confidence?

722
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,940
他有个内部消息来源
He had a-a source on the other side

723
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,960
告诉他对方愿意以此金额进行庭外和解
who told him they were ready to settle.

724
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,110
当时的这个对方内部消息来源是戴安·洛哈特
The other side at the time being Diane Lockhart.

725
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,330
博斯曼先生有没有告诉你们
Did Mr. Boseman tell you

726
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,500
对方出于什么原因这么急于达成和解呢
what the other side was nervous about?

727
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,550
他们发现了一项如果上庭
They-they discovered a piece of evidence

728
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,630
会对他们不利的证据
that would hurt them if they went to trial.

729
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,380
他跟我们说我们不允许跟任何人说
He told us that we're not allowed to-to tell anyone

730
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,440
我们在问询中被问了些什么问题
what they asked us in there.

731
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,290
没错  但你可以告诉我们你们说了些什么
Well, that's true, but you can tell us what you said.

732
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,440
这就是言论自由了
That's free speech.

733
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,310
-我  -我不想搅这趟浑水
- I... - I don't like getting involved in this.

734
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,310
-我们走吧  -等等  留步
- Let's go. - Wait, wait. One second.

735
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,780
我们一起赚了很多钱
Now, we have made a lot of money together.

736
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,680
-对吗  -没错
- Right? - Right.

737
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,300
那么你们是不是聊到了我们经手的一个案子
So, did you talk about one of our cases?

738
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,010
是某个警察暴力执法的案子吗
Was it one of the police brutality cases?

739
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,130
是我们正在代理的案子吗
Is it the one we're running now?

740
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,220
不是
No.

741
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,940
我觉得我们不应该继续回答问题了
I don't think we should answer any more.

742
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,190
我知道  但是
I-I know, but...

743
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,840
就再问一个问题
Just one more question.

744
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,300
是我和戴安共同代理的某案子吗
Is it a case that Diane and I worked on together?

745
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,950
是的  但不是共同代理的
Yeah, but not together.

746
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,260
妈的
Fuck.

747
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,430
但请别说脏话  好吗
But hey, please, don't swear, okay?

748
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,070
-好的  我明白  -我们
- Ah! Okay. I-I-I got it. - We...

749
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,250
会吓到杰
It bugs out Jer.

750
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,250
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

751
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,570
谢谢  谢谢你们能来
And thank you. Thank you for coming.

752
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,750
-祝你们好运  -谢谢
- Yeah. Yeah, good luck. - Thank you.

753
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,770
让我来
Let me get that.

754
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:43,940
谢谢
Appreciate it.

755
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,040
不客气
Yeah, yeah.

756
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,180
这跟托比·肯德尔先生的案子有关
It's about the Toby Kendall case.

757
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,380
他们是想指控我
They're coming after me

758
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,800
告诉你摄像头证据的那件事
for telling you about the camera evidence.

759
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
你没告诉过我任何有关摄像头证据的事
You didn't tell me about any camera evidence.

760
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,190
你让我雇佣了一个律师
You told me to hire an associate

761
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,700
然后  是她发现了证据
who, in turn, discovered evidence.

762
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,740
不  我没有  我透露了更多的信息给你
No, I didn't. I told you more.

763
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,830
而那足以吊销我的律师执照了
That's disbarrable.

764
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,780
戴安
Diane.

765
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,690
听我说
Listen to me.

766
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,280
我们都知道  有时我们会游走在法律的边缘
We all know we get close to the line sometimes.

767
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,300
但现在  我们都试着坚守在法律正义的一方
Now, we try to stay on the right side of the law.

768
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,880
你是想要成为一名好律师
You want to be a good lawyer,

769
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,790
但水至清则无鱼  你也知道你不得不这样做
you need to get close to that line and you know that.

770
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,700
这跟成为一名好律师无关
This wasn't about being a good lawyer.

771
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,960
这就是为了得到一份新工作
This was about getting a new job.

772
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,870
你才不是为了新工作
Not for you,

773
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,160
林德尔家的孩子才是  戴安
for the Rindell kid, Diane.

774
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,050
别再自责了
Stop kicking yourself.

775
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,060
我们正在对付的是
We are dealing with people who are coming at us

776
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,590
紧咬着我们最小的犯规之处不放的人
for the smallest infraction.

777
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,000
那么  我们该怎么为自己辩护
So, how do we defend ourselves?

778
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,970
夸大其词
Mere puffery.

779
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,340
你认真的
Seriously?

780
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,340
自从毕业我就没用过了  不过
I haven't used it since law school, but, hey.

781
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,530
我想我还从来没用过这招
I, I don't think I've ever used it.

782
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,380
-夸大其词
- Mere puffery.

783
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,880
这招真的有用吗
Does that even work?

784
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,880
我们试试就知道有没有用了
Uh, we will find out if it works.

785
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,330
我猜他们下一个会传召你
My guess is they call you next.

786
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,080
该死
Damn it!

787
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,280
老天  谁把你惹毛了
Yikes, who pissed you off?

788
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,720
我们能下次再找时间闲聊吗
Can we do the cute talk another time please?

789
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,440
也许我能帮你呢  什么事
Maybe I can help. What's up?

790
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,770
一串九位数  部分数字有重复
A nine-digit number, some repeats,

791
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,900
都和一些顶尖的首席执行官有关
all connected to top CEOs.

792
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,770
但它们都和纳税申报单号  法律案件号
But none of them are from tax returns

793
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,340
或员工编号无关
or legal cases or employee numbers.

794
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,950
你有试过社会保障号码吗
Did you try Social Security numbers?

795
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:30,930
当然
Yes.

796
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,450
也许这些是密码
Maybe they're passwords.

797
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,190
然后恰好都是九位数的密码
That just happened to all be nine digits?

798
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,060
也许这些和有钱混蛋的秘密帮会有关
Maybe they're part of some secret society of rich assholes.

799
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,460
怎么了
What?

800
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,400
我先澄清一下  我从来没赢过任何东西
Just so I'm clear, I never win at anything.

801
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,720
比方说买彩票  我选的号一个都没中过
If it's a lottery ticket, none of my numbers ever match up.

802
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,720
好吧
Okay.

803
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,050
我见过这个数字
I know this number.

804
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,990
这也是  还有这里
Here, too, and here.

805
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,930
这是我去年的全年薪资和纳税表
This is my W-2 from last year.

806
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,090
然后
And, uh,

807
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,630
这里  那个数字  那是什么
here. There, that number, what is that?

808
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,680
美国公司联邦税号
Federal Tax I.D. Number.

809
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,670
和这个一样
It's the same.

810
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,780
{\an8}《雨人》  达斯汀·霍夫曼主演的电影  
其饰演的角色"雨人"患有自闭症但对数字有超强记忆力

811
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,780
你是什么人啊  雨人
Who are you, Rain Man?

812
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,610
你还没见过我玩21点的风采呢
You should see me at the blackjack tables.

813
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,770
这份全年薪资和纳税表从哪来的
Who's this W-2 from?

814
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,650
我上一份工作  洛哈特&德克尔
My last job, Lockhart, Deckler...

815
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,760
靠
Oh, shit.

816
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,010
跟戴安有关系
It's about Diane.

817
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,210
{\an8}杰·迪佩西亚

818
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,050
我并没有向博斯曼先生泄露
I did not slip Mr. Boseman any information

819
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,830
任何有关托比·肯德尔案子的信息
about the Toby Kendall case.

820
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,650
你确定吗
You're sure?

821
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,500
我确定
I am sure.

822
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,150
那就是博斯曼先生对诉讼投资人撒谎了
So Mr. Boseman lied to these litigation financiers.

823
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,590
不是  我猜他只是夸大其词了
No. My guess, it was mere puffery.

824
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,820
是吗
Really?

825
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,020
夸大其词是通过夸张
Mere puffery is the legally acceptable practice

826
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,890
进而达到推销作用的合法手段
of promoting through exaggeration.

827
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,260
没错  我知道是什么意思  谢谢
Yeah, I know what it is, thank you.

828
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,910
我们再来看看你为  最近被爆出庞氏骗局的
Let's turn to the work that you did for the Rindell Fund,

829
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,130
林德尔基金所做的工作吧
the recently exposed Ponzi scheme.

830
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,560
这是什么  洛哈特女士
What is this, Ms. Lockhart?

831
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,010
我不知道
I have no idea.

832
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,890
这不是一份林德尔基金的贵宾名单吗
Isn't it a list of VIP clients at the Rindell Fund?

833
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,700
可能是吧
It might be.

834
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,810
我也不清楚
I have no idea.

835
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,050
这些客户不就是林德尔基金
Aren't these the Rindell clients

836
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,910
铤而走险的原因所在吗
the Fund went the extra mile for?

837
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,030
倒填收益日期来避免交税
Backdating gains to avoid taxes?

838
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,310
再说一遍  我对此并不知情
Again, this is news to me.

839
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,760
是的  但是
Yes, but...

840
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,070
这难道不是你公司的税号吗
isn't that your firm's I.D. Number?

841
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:18,290
这里  这里  还有这里
There and there and there?

842
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,930
这难道这不是基金为你的法律服务买单的原因吗
Isn't that how the Fund billed your legal work?

843
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,150
再说一遍  这是我第一次看到
Again, this is my first time seeing...

844
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,500
还有这难道不是你安排林德尔的女儿
And isn't this why you arranged for the Rindell daughter

845
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,240
在你的新律所工作的原因吗
to get a job at your new work,

846
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,100
这样他们就不会揭发你的罪责了
so they wouldn't expose your culpability?

847
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,190
不是
No.

848
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,140
好吧  还好我们明天会请
Well, it's a good thing we have Henry Rindell

849
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,180
亨利·林德尔来出庭
coming in tomorrow to...

850
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,080
把这件事情说清楚
clear this matter up.

851
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,410
我必须辞职离开律所
I need to resign from this firm.

852
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,040
什么
Oh, yeah?

853
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,780
为什么
Why is that?

854
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,660
因为我马上就要被起诉了
Because I'm about to be indicted.

855
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,090
你  犯了什么罪吗
Are you... guilty of anything?

856
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,830
除了和小人做朋友以外
Other than being friends with the wrong people?

857
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,060
没有
No.

858
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,890
那么  你觉得我会因为律所的人
Then, do you think it surprises me

859
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,590
被盯上而感到意外吗
that someone inside this firm is being targeted?

860
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,530
亨利·林德尔已经听他调遣了
He has Henry Rindell in his pocket.

861
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,790
他准备要针对我来进行控告
He is going to get an indictment against me.

862
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,420
-假设他会  -我来这没多久  阿德里安
- Assume he does. - I haven't been here that long, Adrian...

863
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,170
那又有什么关系  戴安
What does that matter, Diane?

864
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,260
我才不会在他那样的混蛋面前害怕而逃跑
I'm not running scared from motherfuckers like him.

865
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,070
我要反击
I got to fight him.

866
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,570
你也要反击
You got to fight him.

867
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,070
所以  我们应该一起反击
So, we might as well fight him together.

868
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,970
真没想到会走到这一步
Bizarre that it's come to this.

869
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,430
是啊
Yeah.

870
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,810
可以这么说
That's one word.

871
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,250
你需要什么  宝贝
So what do you need, babe?

872
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,570
你明天会去向大陪审团作证是吗
You're testifying to the grand jury tomorrow?

873
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,910
-没错  -好吧
- Yeah. - Yeah.

874
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,770
你要作对戴安不利的证明
You're testifying against Diane?

875
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,360
不  我只是要说出事实
No, I'm telling the truth.

876
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,670
你所挑选的事实
Your alternative truth?

877
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,680
是的  戴安为基金提供了很多法律服务
Yeah, Diane did a lot of legal work for the Fund.

878
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,860
因为她是你的朋友
Because she was your friend.

879
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,820
不  是因为我们花钱雇了她
No, because we paid her.

880
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,960
这就是你让我从贾克斯叔叔电脑里
Is that why you had me get the Schtup list

881
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,070
拿鬼混名单的原因吗
from Uncle Jax's computer?

882
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,700
这样你就能利用它对付戴安了
So that you could use it against Diane?

883
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,310
制造她收受贿赂的假象
Make it look like she took a bribe?

884
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,980
不  这样我就有了筹码
No, so I would have some leverage.

885
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,230
你为了减刑就背叛了她
You betrayed her for a lighter sentence?

886
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,130
去坐牢的不是你  也不是你妈妈
You won't see any jail time, Mom won't either.

887
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,050
那你呢
And you?

888
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,410
我不想死在监狱里  玛娅
I don't want to die in prison, Maia.

889
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,810
我希望能有机会看到你生孩子
I want a chance to see you have kids.

890
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,730
我想抱抱我的外孙
I want to hold my grandkids.

891
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,000
协商结果是什么
What was the deal?

892
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,100
十年
Ten years.

893
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,670
不要说对戴安不利的证词
Don't testify against Diane.

894
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,300
什么  我不得不
What? I have to.

895
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,530
不  爸爸  如果他们提议减到十年监禁
No. Dad, if they're offering ten years,

896
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,050
那他们的胜面肯定很小
they must have a weak case.

897
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,760
这样做也是为了你
It's for you, too.

898
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,430
你要是这么做  爸爸
You do this, Dad,

899
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,250
如果我以后有了孩子
and if I ever have any kids,

900
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,170
你永远不会见到他们的
you'll never see them.

901
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,360
我永远不会让你见到他们
I'll never let you see them.

902
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,560
我爱你
I love you.

903
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,910
全体起立
All rise.

904
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,000
我们把本案审结吧
Okay, let's wind this down.

905
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,420
今天有什么情况
What do we have today?

906
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,170
我还有一个证人  法官阁下
I just have one more witness, Your Honor. 

907
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,120
-你保证吗
- Promise?

908
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,450
是的  您不觉得有趣吗
I think so. Aren't you having fun?

909
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,560
我方反对这位证人出庭  法官阁下
We object to this witness, Your Honor.

910
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,310
又是你一个人  是吗  律师
All alone again, are you, counselor?

911
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,590
是的  克里斯特瓦先生认为有这位证人在
Yes, Mr. Kresteva thought it best to stay away

912
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,020
他不在场会比较好
given this next witness.

913
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,600
那我就很好奇了
Now I am curious.

914
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,220
你们知道这位证人是谁
You know who this witness is?

915
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,400
是的  传票今早才送到
Yes, the subpoena was served this morning.

916
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,390
我想重申我对允许此人
And I would like to reiterate my objection

917
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,000
出庭作证的反对意见
to permitting this man to testify.

918
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,960
奎因女士  为了她所谓的无辜
Ms. Quinn, for all her purported innocence,

919
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,630
似乎在不顾一切地贬损司法系统
seems hell-bent on compromising the integrity

920
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,840
法官阁下  我没有做过任何
Your Honor, I have done nothing 

921
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,010
-的正直性  -这样的事
- of the judicial system. - of the sort.

922
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,340
天呐  你们这些人这么喜欢听自己说话吗
My God, you people love to hear yourselves talk.

923
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,220
传唤你的证人吧
Call your witness.

924
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,580
我们传唤亨利·林德尔
We call Henry Rindell.

925
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,280
-谢谢  -你还好吗
- Thank you. - Are you all right?

926
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,620
不太好
No, not really.

927
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,120
我很想能说事情会变好
I wish I could tell you it'll get easier.

928
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,960
我也希望您能如此对我说
I wish you could tell me that, too.

929
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,460
我猜这个人之后将会在
I imagine this is someone who's going to be testifying

930
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,920
大陪审团面前作证
in front of the grand jury later?

931
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,830
是的  法官阁下
It is, Your Honor.

932
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:31,010
而且我猜你们会承诺不向他问
And I imagine you're going to promise not to ask questions

933
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,070
有关他会如何作证的问题
about what he'll testify to?

934
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,530
不止如此  法官阁下
I'll go even further, Your Honor.

935
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,700
我对证人只有一个问题
I have just one question for this witness.

936
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,070
要反对吗  律师
Any objections, counselor? 

937
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,010
那要看是什么问题了  法官阁下
Well, that depends on the question, Your Honor.

938
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,970
真是令人紧张的时刻
Quite the suspenseful moment.

939
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,570
请继续
Please, proceed.

940
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,920
林德尔先生
Mr. Rindell...

941
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,590
早上好
Good morning.

942
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,850
早上好
Good morning.

943
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,940
迈克·克里斯特瓦向你提供了什么交换条件
What did Michael Kresteva offer you in exchange

944
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,920
让你去大陪审团作证
for your grand jury testimony?

945
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,750
你看他干什么
What are you looking at him for?

946
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,400
我对这个问题不确定
I wasn't sure of the question.

947
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,570
那就看着我
Well, then, look at me.

迈克·克里斯特瓦向你提供了什么交换条件

949
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,590
让你去大陪审团作证
for your grand jury testimony?

950
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,810
他说他会向法官建议判我十年监禁
He said he would recommend to the judge

951
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:24,290
而非无假释的终身监禁
a sentence of ten years instead of life without parole.

952
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,390
没有其他问题了
No further questions.

953
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,670
{\an8}助理总检察长威尔伯·丁肯

954
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,240
我对认罪协议毫不知情
I had no idea of the plea deal.

955
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,950
不  我没有批准
No, I did not authorize it.

956
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,170
是  参议员  我知道您的财产受损
Yes, Senator, I understand you lost money.

957
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,510
我把「太阳时报」接到一号线了
I've got the Sun-Times on line one.

958
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,930
告诉他们无可奉告
Tell them no comment.

959
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,750
迈克·克里斯特瓦来了

让他进来  让我的电话都等等
Have him come in and hold my calls.

961
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,930
好的  不要
Yes. No.

962
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,050
原来那开关是这么用的
So that's what that does.

963
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,640
恭喜你
Congratulations.

964
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,580
恭喜什么
What for?

965
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
我刚刚被解职了
I was just relieved of my duties.

966
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,290
真的吗
You're kidding.

967
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,470
我是说  我很遗憾
I mean, I'm sorry.

968
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,100
给你  给你的小礼物
Here you go. Little present for you.

969
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,800
我什么没给你准备
Oh, and I didn't get you anything.

970
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,860
是的  那就这样吧
Yes, and let's keep it that way.

我很高兴这事结束了
Well, I'm just happy it's over.

972
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,330
有意思
That's funny.

973
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,670
什么有意思
What is?

974
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,610
我只是觉得好笑  你觉得这事结束了
Oh, I just think it's funny that you think this is over.

艾达
Ada.

977
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,540
我应该对你说谢谢
I owe you a thank you.

978
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,360
-你不必  -不  我要道谢
- No, you don't. - I do.

979
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,830
你本可以保护你自己
You could have protected yourself...

980
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:57,890
真的不用客气
Please, don't mention it.

981
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,940
但你保护了我
And instead, you protected me.

982
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:03,690
