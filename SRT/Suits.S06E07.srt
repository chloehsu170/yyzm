{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,230
你有不在场证明的证人
You had an alibi witness

16
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,950
然而你的公诉人却让她走掉了
and your public defender let her get away?

17
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,970
我一直都是这么说的啊
That's what I've been saying.

18
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,290
因为我一开始就跟你说了
I told you when I started this thing

19
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,250
我不会跟你串通的
I'm not going to collude.

20
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,600
我们这不是串通  这叫发现
We're not colluding. It's called discovery.

21
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,470
你赶快告诉我  凯文・米勒到底知道些什么
So, why don't you tell me what Kevin Miller knows?

22
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,140
凯文设计了一个交易软件
He developed the trading programs

23
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,250
萨特声称是靠那个软件获得了高额回报
that Sutter claims to use to get his superior returns.

24
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,130
所以你想要凯文作证
So you're looking to have Kevin testify

25
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,330
那个软件是狗屁  而萨特也是知情的
that software is bullshit, and Sutter knows it.

26
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,510
我发现长久以来不断努力
The thing that I worked so hard on

27
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,730
想到得到那自恋狂的认同的做法不过是谎言
to get that prick's approval was nothing but a lie.

28
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,800
-把这事告诉吉尔  -她早就知情了
- You told Jill and-- - She already knew.

29
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,780
她参与了
She was in on it.

30
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,340
哈维  老实告诉我包里到底放了什么
What the hell is in the bag, Harvey?

31
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,920
放着你需要用来保护案子
What you needed to keep this case going

32
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,130
而我一直不让你碰的东西
and I stopped you from getting.

33
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,320
所以痛快承认我们同一战线
So let's just admit that we're in this together

34
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
完成这件事
and get this thing done.

35
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,420
我要你现在保证
I want your word right now

36
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,180
你不会把我跟你说的告诉别人
that you won't tell anyone what I told you.

37
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,920
-凯文  拜托  -迈克  我说真的
- Kevin, please, you-- - Mike, I'm serious.

38
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,390
不许让别人
No one can ever know

39
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,460
知道我告诉你的事情
anything about what I told you.

40
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,470
法官还是决定
The judge decided to rule

41
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,500
撤销你的案子了
on your motion to dismiss after all.

42
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,120
这意味着我们没有时间了
Which means we're out of time.

43
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,650
我来问你要那个交易程序
I came here to ask for that trading program.

44
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,060
伦纳德・贝利的处决日期已经定下来了
Leonard Bailey's execution date has been set.

45
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,870
我不知道要怎么跟一个人说他马上就要死了
And I don't know how to tell a man that he's going to die.

46
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,810
你是谁
Who are you?

47
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,180
贝利先生  我是杰西卡・皮尔逊
Mr. Bailey, my name is Jessica Pearson.

48
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,190
我是你的首席辩护律师
And I'm lead counsel on your case.

49
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,640
你来这里
Well, you coming here,

50
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,750
肯定是有什么很重要的事
it must be about something important.

51
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,870
确实
It is.

52
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,230
伦纳德
Leonard,

53
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,010
你的处决日期已经定下来了
your execution date has been set.

54
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,740
什么时候
When?

55
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,920
-日期定下来了不代表  -什么时候
- Just because they've set the date doesn't-- - When?

56
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,920
三十天后
30 days.

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,600
伦纳德  我很抱歉
Leonard, I'm so sorry.

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,270
我不需要你的道歉
I don't need your sorry.

59
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,160
我想知道你会怎么处理这件事
I want to know what you're doing about this.

60
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,020
我们会提请一个延期动议
We're going to file a motion to delay.

61
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,780
我不在乎什么延期
I don't give a shit about delaying.

62
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,610
我是说
I mean,

63
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,690
你们打算如何救我出去
what are we doing to get me out?

64
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,450
我们正在努力
We're--we're working on it.

65
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,910
但是  伦纳德  现在很重要的一件事是
But I-I do think, Leonard, that it's really important

66
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,720
你得花些时间接受这个事情
that you take some time to process this.

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,640
我接受了十二年了
I've been processing for 12 years!

68
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,760
你说过你会找到玛利亚
You said that you were going to find Maria.

69
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,870
那请告诉我你为什么在这里
So tell me, what are you doing here

70
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,830
而不是在外面找人
instead of out there tracking her down?

71
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,190
伦纳德  我知道这很难
Leonard, I know that this is difficult, and--

72
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,110
贝利先生  瑞秋的意思是
Mr. Bailey, what Rachel means

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,730
我们下一步正是这么计划的
is that's exactly what we're going to do.

74
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,030
卡荷尔先生  你最好有个很好的理由
Mr. Cahill, you better have a compelling reason

75
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,890
阻止我通过斯佩克特先生的撤诉申请
why I shouldn't grant Mr. Specter a dismissal,

76
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,480
不然我马上就会通过
or this thing is going to be over before it gets started.

77
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,590
我有一个最有力的理由
Oh, I have the most compelling reason of all.

78
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,130
一份萨特先生交易软件的副本
A copy of Mr. Sutter's trading program.

79
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,290
胡说  他上周就在这试图
Bullshit. He was in here trying to subpoena

80
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,660
传唤这个软件
this thing last week

81
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,960
然后软件就这样出现在他手里了
and now it miraculously falls in his lap?

82
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,330
-你在暗示什么  -我在暗示
- What are you implying? - I'm implying

83
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,690
我不知道你做了什么  但肯定不是
I don't know what you did, but Santa sure as hell

84
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,630
圣诞老人昨晚放在你的树下的
didn't put that thing under your tree last night.

85
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,680
除非你能证明我做错了什么
Well, unless you have proof that I did something wrong,

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,730
否则你就闭嘴吧
you can shut the hell up.

87
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,890
好了  不要吵了
All right, that's enough.

88
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,920
假设这东西是合法取得的
Now assuming this thing is legitimate,

89
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,670
我能通过它了解到什么
what's it gonna show me?

90
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,090
您能了解到过去五年中萨特先生95%的交易
It's going to show you that it's responsible for 95%

91
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,880
都是通过这个软件完成的
of Mr. Sutter's trades over five years.

92
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,420
你是想帮我赢了这场官司吗
Are you trying to win this case for me

93
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,600
因为我一直辩护说
because my entire defense

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,370
我的客户是通过这个软件做的交易
is that my client makes his trades using that program.

95
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,280
-正是  -我关心的
- Exactly. - It's not the 95%

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,160
不是那95%  而是剩下的那5%
I'm concerned with, it's the other five.

97
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,080
他是靠那些交易赚取的那些高额利润
Those are the ones he made billions of dollars on.

98
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,930
他之所以能够那样做
The only way he could have done that

99
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,240
正是因为内幕交易
is by trading on inside information.

100
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,150
你的撤诉动议被否决了
Motion for dismissal denied.

101
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,310
先生们  我们要进行庭审
Gentlemen, we're going to trial.

102
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,730
但是卡荷尔先生  如果我发现
But Mr. Cahill, if it comes to light

103
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,570
这个东西是非法取得的
that you obtained this program illegally,

104
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,170
我不仅会撤销案子
not only am I going toss this case,

105
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,240
还会指控你恶意起诉
you're gonna be faced with a charge of malicious prosecution.

106
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,310
我们接下来要做的是
Here's what we're gonna do.

107
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,680
我不在乎我们接下来要做什么
I don't give a shit what we're gonna do.

108
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,190
我想知道他怎么得到的那个东西
I want to know where the hell he got that thing.

109
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,960
我不知道
I don't know,

110
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,000
但那不是我们需要解答的唯一问题
but that's not the only question we need to answer.

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,120
还有什么问题
What other question is there?

112
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,350
威廉  我不知道你有没有意识到
William, I don't know if you've noticed,

113
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,870
但你有个员工想要拉你下马
but you've got an employee that's looking to take you down

114
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,370
我们需要找出是谁
and we need to figure out who it is.

115
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,390
我们到底要怎样才能找出这个人
How exactly are we going to do that?

116
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,750
我们要开始
We're gonna start conducting interviews

117
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,200
和你每一个员工谈话
with every employee you have.

118
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,310
但在开始之前
But before we do that,

119
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,780
我要去确保肖恩・卡荷尔
I'm gonna make sure Sean Cahill

120
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,920
在证据交换阶段没有其他什么瞒着我们的了
isn't hiding anything else from us in discovery.

121
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,120
所以恕我失陪
So, if you'll excuse me,

122
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,000
我得独自去处理这件事了
I need to handle this myself.

123
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,300
你现在来找我干什么  哈维
What are you coming to me here for, Harvey,

124
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,340
萨特就在那里
Sutter's 30 feet away.

125
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,330
放心  他以为我是来确保
Relax. He thinks I'm making sure

126
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,540
你不会在证据交换阶段再耍什么花招的
that you didn't pull another fast one with discovery.

127
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,390
所以只要我俩看上去像是在吵架
So as long as it looks like we're arguing,

128
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:09,960
那就没问题
we're fine.

129
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,910
那不成问题  因为我有个消息告诉你
That's not gonna be a problem 'cause I got some news.

130
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,240
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

131
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,750
你一离开  她就立案了
Two seconds after you left, she put us on the docket.

132
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,860
五天之后就要上庭了
We go to trial in five days,

133
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,170
但如今我手上什么都没有
and right now I don't have shit.

134
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,370
你想让我说些什么呢  肖恩
What do you want me to say, Sean?

135
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,350
我已经利用刚刚那场戏
I'm already using what we did

136
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,920
来要求和他的员工们谈话了
to shake the trees with his employees.

137
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,790
那还不够
That's not good enough.

138
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,100
所以你必须回到监狱
So you need to go back to that prison

139
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,130
告诉迈克  他最好尽快给我套出点料来
and tell Mike that he better get me something and get it fast

140
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,550
因为我昨晚出卖灵魂
'cause I didn't sell my soul last night

141
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,150
可不是为了看着那混蛋逍遥法外的
to watch that bastard ride off into the sunset.

142
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,080
谢天谢地  你俩都在
Thank God you are both here.

143
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,070
法式甜甜圈  给女神一号
French cruller for goddess number one.

144
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,760
肉桂白糖甜甜圈  给女神二号
Cinnamon sugar for goddess number two.

145
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,760
尽管我很乐意接受一个美味的甜甜圈
While I do appreciated a tasty doughnut,

146
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,920
我还是想知道这是为了什么
I'd like to know what the occasion is.

147
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,650
路易买点心过来
There are exactly three reasons for Louis

148
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,390
只会有三个原因
to come bearing pastry.

149
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,650
埃斯特剪了个糟糕的发型
Esther got a bad haircut,

150
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,740
他找到人帮忙治疗他弯曲的拇指了
he found someone to fix his crooked thumb,

151
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,560
或者他想要寻求我们的建议
or he wants our advice.

152
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,500
我超级希望是拇指的事
I wish like hell it was the thumb,

153
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,730
但实际上我是来求建议的
but it's actually advice.

154
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,360
昨晚我和塔拉度过了很美好的一段时光
Last night, I had the most amazing time with Tara.

155
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,850
我知道你俩都在脑补一场棒棒的啪啪啪
I know you're both picturing it involved fantastic sex.

156
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,740
-没有  -一点都没有
- Nope. - Not a bit.

157
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,420
无论如何  塔拉和我周五晚上要约会
In any event, Tara and I have a date on Friday night,

158
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,530
我希望约会的结局是我俩的灵魂融为一体
and I'm hoping it ends with our souls merging as one.

159
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,010
-我退出  -什么  为什么
- And I'm out. - What? Why?

160
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,690
因为我是个专业的秘书  路易
Because I am a professional secretary, Louis.

161
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,580
我不是来帮你
I'm not here to help you play Hide the Litt

162
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,080
追某个妞儿的
with some strumpet.

163
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,660
她完全不懂我
She so doesn't get me.

164
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,080
知道吗  路易  她说的有道理
You know what, Louis? She has a point.

165
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,820
这话什么意思
What are you talking about?

166
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,510
为了追求这个我完全不认识的人
A lot of manpower has been devoted

167
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,460
你已经耗费了许多人力了
to your pursuit of this virtual stranger.

168
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,640
说到人力  我指的就是我宝贵的时间
And by manpower, I mean my precious time.

169
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,910
所以我觉得你是时候自己搞定了
So I think it's time that you took care of this yourself.

170
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,430
该死的
Goddamn it.

171
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,700
你觉得我要是搞得定的话我会找你们吗
Don't you think if I could have I would have?

172
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,400
我觉得  假如你不知道
What I think is, if you can't figure out

173
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,300
该如何和一个
how to have a simple date

174
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,990
已经答应了和你出去的女人约会的话
with a woman who's already agreed to go out with you,

175
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,340
那你也许从一开始
then maybe you don't deserve to go out with her

176
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,520
就不配约她出去
in the first place.

177
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,930
这个建议如何
How's that for advice?

178
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,970
哈维
Harvey.

179
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,280
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

180
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,830
什么叫我来这里干什么
What do you mean what am I doing here?

181
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,330
我需要知道你是否掌握了什么料
I need to know if you have anything yet.

182
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,850
-没有  -你在逗我吗
- I don't. - Are you kidding me?

183
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,330
他们两个人大吵之后
After the way those two guys got into it,

184
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,060
你居然告诉我凯文走出房间后
you're telling me Kevin didn't start talking

185
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,880
什么也没说吗
the second he left the room?

186
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,030
的确  他什么也没说
No. He didn't say a word.

187
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,810
我们必须让他吐露一些事情
Well, we need to get him to say something

188
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,660
这样才能把你弄出去
to get you out of here.

189
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,380
我知道  但我也不能按个按钮
Yeah, I know. But I can't just push a button

190
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,270
就让凯文背叛萨特啊
and get Kevin to turn on Sutter.

191
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,800
-不  你可以的  -什么意思
- Yes, you can. - What are you talking about?

192
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,060
你可以告诉他  他的算法被泄露给了卡荷尔
You can tell him his algorithm was leaked to Cahill.

193
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,020
什么时候的事
When the hell did that happen?

194
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,040
昨晚  我给他的
Last night, when I leaked it.

195
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,780
天呐  你们就这样串通一气了
Jesus Christ, so you're just out and out colluding now.

196
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,030
我别无选择
Look, I didn't have a choice.

197
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,330
除非卡荷尔拿出什么猛料
The judge was gonna toss this case

198
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,100
不然法官都打算放弃这个案子了
unless Cahill came up with a Hail Mary.

199
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,360
好吧  我尽力说服凯文
All right, I--I'll use it the best I can with Kevin.

200
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,750
但是  哈维  他很敏感
But, Harvey, he's sensitive.

201
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,920
这得花上一段时间
This is gonna take a little time.

202
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,130
问题就在这里  迈克  我们没时间了
That's the thing, Mike. We don't have time.

203
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,470
法官定下了开庭日期
The judge set a trial date.

204
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,840
如果你不能尽快为卡荷尔套出什么料
Which means if you don't get Cahill something soon,

205
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,280
接下来的两年你就得待在这里面了
you're gonna be sitting here for the next two years.

206
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,550
怎么了  瑞秋
What's going on, Rachel?

207
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,870
回来的路上你一句话都没说
You haven't said a word the entire ride back.

208
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,930
没什么
Nothing.

209
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,010
只不过是实际情况比我想象中还要难得多
Just a lot harder than I thought it would be.

210
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,390
你没想到他会发火
You didn't think he would be angry.

211
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,400
我没想到他会冲着我们发火
I didn't think that he'd be angry at us.

212
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,970
他不是在冲我们发火
Well, he wasn't angry at us.

213
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,650
只不过房间里没有其他人而已
There just wasn't anybody else in that room.

214
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,910
那现在怎么办
So now what?

215
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,190
现在我们努力解决这件事
Now we try to fix this damn thing.

216
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,960
你是说要找到玛利亚・戈麦斯
You mean by finding Maria Gomez.

217
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,750
我是说要推迟行刑
I mean by delaying this execution.

218
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,030
杰西卡  伦纳德说得对
Jessica, Leonard's right.

219
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,310
如果我们不能推翻死刑
What good does it do to delay the execution

220
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,080
推迟有什么意义
if we can't stop it from happening?

221
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,330
因为如果不推迟  我们就没有时间
Because if we don't, we don't have time

222
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,220
去找到玛利亚・戈麦斯
to find Maria Gomez.

223
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,060
我在想你昨晚跟我说的
I was thinking about what you told me last night

224
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,600
给吉尔弄豁免权的事
about getting Jill immunity.

225
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,100
迈克  我说过了  我不想谈这件事
Mike, I told you, I don't want to talk about this.

226
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,690
那你想谈谈如果萨特还是倒台了
Maybe you want to talk about what's going to happen to her

227
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,260
她会怎么样吗
if Sutter goes down anyway.

228
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,650
-不会的  -你怎么知道
- That's not gonna happen. - You don't know that.

229
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,730
我只知道如果我们之中
Yeah, well, I know what happens

230
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,650
有人出卖他会怎么样
if either one of us turns on him.

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,300
我们会落得身无分文
We won't have a penny to our name.

232
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,400
你开玩笑吧  你留在这儿他付你钱吗
Are you kidding me? Is he paying you to be in here?

233
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,560
听我说  我们拥有的一切都跟他有关
Listen to me, everything we have is tied to that man.

234
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,150
如果他坐牢了  我们会失去一切
And if he goes away, we lose it all.

235
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,120
我问的不是这个  他有没有承诺
That's not what I asked. Did he promise you money

236
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,970
只要你不出卖他  他就给你钱
if you kept quiet?

237
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,860
他当然承诺了
Of course he goddamn did.

238
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,630
等到我出去的那天  吉尔和我
And the day I get out of here, Jill and I are going to

239
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,150
会拿着那笔钱开始新的生活
take that money and start a new life.

240
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,080
你们也可以跟控方达成协议  马上开始新生活
Or you could both cut a deal and start a new life right now.

241
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,530
那会是一种什么样的生活
What kind of life is that gonna be?

242
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,540
因为我自己是白手起家
Because I come from nothing.

243
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,010
所以我不会让我的孩子过那样的生活
And I'm not gonna do that to my kids.

244
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,820
其实还有比白手起家更差的
Well, I'm telling you there are worse things you could be.

245
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,500
你怎么对我的生活这么感兴趣
Why are you so interested in my well being?

246
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,580
因为我是你的朋友  设身处地为你着想
Because I'm your friend and I was in your position.

247
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,330
我觉得你最好是把实话说出来
And I decided it was better to give it all up

248
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,540
而不是一直担惊受怕
than to keep looking over my shoulder

249
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,250
等着有一天真相大白
waiting for the ax to fall.

250
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,310
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

251
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,250
你知道我是诈骗犯  并且持续了多年对吧
You know I was a fraud, right? You know I did it for years.

252
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,720
你不知道的是
What you don't know is that I quit

253
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,870
我在被捕前二十分钟辞了职
20 minutes before I got arrested.

254
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,160
而那二十分钟是我人生最平和的时候
And it was 20 of the most peaceful minutes of my entire life.

255
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,460
好  但是看看你现在的下场
Yeah, well, look at what happened to you anyways.

256
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,810
-凯文  那不是  -够了
- Kevin, that's not the-- - That's enough.

257
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,280
我说过我不想谈这个  不想谈
I told you I'm done talking about it, and I'm done.

258
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,370
如果你真的是我的朋友
And if you're really my friend,

259
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,470
就再也别跟我提这件事
you won't ever bring this up to me again.

260
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,660
搞到《汉密尔顿》的后台座位
Get backstage seats to "Hamilton."

261
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,490
租到中央公园
Mm, rent out Central Park.

262
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,990
乘协和式客机去巴黎
Fly the Concorde to Paris.

263
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,300
不  等等  太蠢了
No, wait, that's stupid

264
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,750
因为现在已经没有协和式客机了
because they don't have the Concorde anymore.

265
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,410
我的天呐  就这个了
Holy shit, that's it.

266
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,260
找到现存最后的协和式客机
Find the last existing Concorde,

267
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,970
租下来  然后飞去巴黎
rent it, and fly that to Paris.

268
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,020
路易  不管你在做什么  我要你先放一放
Louis, whatever you're doing, I need you to put it down.

269
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,640
现在不行  哈维  我在计划
Not now, Harvey. I'm planning the ultimate date

270
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,500
跟我此生挚爱的终极约会
for the love of my life.

271
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,820
是迈克的事
This is for Mike.

272
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,460
好吧  你需要我做什么
All right, what do you need me to do?

273
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,310
这是近五年威廉・萨特
This is every big money trade

274
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,650
做的每一笔大额交易
William Sutter's made in the last five years.

275
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,370
我要你检查一遍  逆推一下
I need you to go through it, reverse engineer it,

276
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,230
找到所有内部交易的证据
and find any evidence you can of insider trading.

277
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,610
如果我有萨特的文件会容易很多
That would be a lot easier if I had access to Sutter's files.

278
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,180
我现在没办法给你那些
Well, I can't get that to you right now.

279
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,600
-为什么  -因为不能让他知道我们的动作
- Why not? - Because he can't know we're doing this.

280
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,070
好吧  哈维  上周你跟我说
Okay, Harvey, last week you told me

281
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,200
你是为了保护我
that you were protecting me

282
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,480
才什么都不告诉我
by not telling me what's going on.

283
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,780
别再保护我了
Stop protecting me,

284
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,180
到底是什么情况
and what the hell is going on?

285
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,520
我跟肖恩・卡荷尔做了笔交易
I cut a deal with Sean Cahill.

286
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,430
扳倒萨特  迈克出狱
Sutter goes down, Mike gets out.

287
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,590
-我的天呐  -我知道
- Holy shit. - I know.

288
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,370
别跟我说迈克还没搞到你要的东西
And don't tell me Mike still doesn't have anything for you.

289
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,550
对  他还没有  而还有五天就开庭了
No, he doesn't. And his trial starts in five days.

290
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,770
-那我最好赶紧开始  -谢谢你  路易
- Well, I better get on it. - Thank you, Louis.

291
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,390
迈克  怎么样了
Hey, Mike. How's it going?

292
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,620
你在这里做什么  加洛
What are you doing here, Gallo?

293
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,310
你知道  在外面的时候
You know, when I was on the outside,

294
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,220
我不是块头最大的  不是最强的
I wasn't the biggest, I wasn't the strongest,

295
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,170
甚至不是最聪明的
I wasn't even the smartest.

296
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,460
但大家让我管事  知道为什么吗
but they let me run things. You know why?

297
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,260
不知道  但我觉得你马上要告诉我了
No. I have a feeling you're about to tell me.

298
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,410
情况不对的时候我特别敏感
I had a knack for knowing when something didn't smell right.

299
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,810
你现在就不太对
Something doesn't smell right with you.

300
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,230
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

301
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,290
你要告诉我
You're gonna tell me

302
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,430
哈维今早没有来见你吗
Harvey didn't stop by this morning to see you.

303
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,700
-开始紧密监视我了吗  -当然了
- Tracking my every move now? - I sure as hell am.

304
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,880
你以为我会把我的自由全权交给你们吗
You think I'm gonna trust the two of you with my freedom?

305
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,950
哈维说了他会把你弄出去  就会说到做到
Harvey said that he'll get you out and he will.

306
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,030
那如果他已经试了但失败了呢
And what if he already tried and he can't?

307
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,160
没有这种事
That didn't happen.

308
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,300
是吗  让我们来想一下可能的情况
Yeah, well let me run a little scenario by you.

309
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,690
他提交了你要提交的文件  但是没有通过
He filed whatever you filed and it didn't fly.

310
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,060
然后他来告诉你这件事
Then he came to tell you that,

311
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,080
这样你们俩就能统一口径了
so the two of you would have your stories straight

312
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,220
从而一直操控着我
so you could string me along.

313
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,580
不是这么回事  加洛
That's not what happened, Gallo.

314
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,180
他是因为我的案子来找我
He came here to see me about my case.

315
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,730
跟你说吧  迈克
You want to know something, Mike?

316
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,090
我根本不在乎你的案子
I don't give a shit about your case.

317
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,490
所以你告诉哈维  他下次再来
So you tell Harvey next time he comes here,

318
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,750
最好带来点新进展
he better come with some progress.

319
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,820
因为我感觉很准
'Cause I've got that sense of smell.

320
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,990
你俩肯定在干脏事
And something in here stinks.

321
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,450
唐娜・鲍尔森的办公室  有何贵干
Donna Paulsen's office, how can I help you?

322
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,770
有一通来自丹伯里...
You have a call from Danbury...

323
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,310
我来付费
I'll accept the charges.

324
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,020
正在接通中  请勿挂断
Please hold while your call is being connected.

325
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,930
-唐娜  -还有一周才是我生日
- Donna. - My birthday's not for another week,

326
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,220
但还是谢谢你打来电话问候
but I appreciate the call.

327
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,400
你生日还有五个月零六天呢
Your birthday's not for another five months and six days

328
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,720
你明知道我记得很清楚
and you know I know that.

329
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,190
我也知道你到时肯定在场
And I also know that you'll be here

330
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,250
帮我跟大家一起庆生
helping me celebrate with everyone.

331
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,530
谢谢你  唐娜
Thanks, Donna.

332
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,280
你还好吧
You doing okay?

333
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,390
还能撑住
Yeah, I'm hanging in.

334
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,640
很好  你需要我帮什么忙
Good. Now what's the favor you were going to ask me?

335
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,470
你怎么知道
How'd you know?

336
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,790
因为你打给了我  没打给哈维
Because you called my line and not Harvey's,

337
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,990
并且我能感觉到我的朋友有求于我
and I know when my friend needs me.

338
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,640
说吧  想让我帮你干什么
So why don't you tell me how I can help?

339
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,660
你还记得有次你找人假扮我
Do you remember that time you impersonated someone for me

340
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,260
差点进了监狱吗
and almost went to prison?

341
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,380
有点印象
Rings a bell.

342
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,700
我想让你故技重施一次
I need you to do the exact same thing.

343
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,870
只不过这次  我找到了一种完全合法的方式
Only this time I found a way to make it totally legal.

344
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,180
让我先搞清楚
Let me get this straight.

345
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,640
你们想让我推迟他的行刑时间
You want me to delay this man's execution

346
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,560
理由就是他十二年前的那个主张
based on his own assertion from 12 years ago

347
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,860
有人能证明他不在场
that there's an alibi witness?

348
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,560
法官大人  我们知道
Your Honor, we understand

349
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,250
这不足以启动重审程序
that's not enough to reopen the case.

350
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,210
我们只想申请更多时间来找到那个证人
We're just asking for more time to locate the witness.

351
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,430
你们有十二年的时间去寻找证人
You've had 12 years to locate the witness.

352
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,120
更不用说就在行刑日期确定的当天
Not to mention that the day the execution is set

353
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,870
她们的委托人恰好就
is the day that their client just happened

354
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,410
突然想起还有个目击证人
to suddenly remember the witness in the first place.

355
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,850
他不是突然想起的
He didn't suddenly remember.

356
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,670
他十二年来一直都是这么跟别人说的
He's been saying it for 12 years.

357
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,320
并且他终于找到一个足够重视事实
And he finally found someone who cares enough about the truth

358
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,750
想帮他找到她的人
to help him find her.

359
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,050
好大的胆子
How dare you.

360
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,060
我重视事实
I care about the truth.

361
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,340
是我证明了他谋杀
And I convicted a murderer.

362
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,310
法官大人  这是对两名
Your Honor, this was a brutal murder

363
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,090
十六岁少年的血腥谋杀
of two 16-year-old children.

364
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,480
这两个孩子的家人今天也已到场
And the families of both of those children are here today

365
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,850
因为他们已经等待了十二年
because they've waited 12 years

366
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,240
想给这场噩梦画上句号
for their nightmare to finally end

367
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,400
没有任何法律上的理由让他们继续承受这样的折磨
and there is no legal reason to prolong their suffering.

368
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,300
法官大人
Your Honor,

369
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,500
您有权推迟伦纳德・贝利的行刑日期
you have the power to push Leonard Bailey's execution

370
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,750
只要您认为理由正当  
if you see fit.

371
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,260
即使他只有1%的可能是清白的
Isn't it worth doing

372
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,520
这么做不也是值得的吗
if there's even a 1% chance that he is innocent?

373
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,320
你们有一周时间来找到证人
You have one week to find a witness.

374
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,030
一周后  你们就不能再申请重审
After that, you cannot move to reopen his trial

375
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,320
他的行刑日期就不会再变了
and his execution date is set in stone.

376
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,710
你在这  我找了你一上午
There you are. I've been looking for you all morning.

377
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,680
我之前在忙正事  路易
I had something important to do, Louis.

378
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,610
这会也要忙点别的工作
And now I have actual work to catch up on,

379
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,560
所以现在不能跟你聊你约会的事
so I can't really talk to you about your date right now.

380
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,070
不  不  不是约会的事
No, no. It's not about my date.

381
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,440
是哈维案子的事
It's about Harvey's case.

382
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,440
我知道跟迈克有关
I know it's for Mike.

383
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,040
怎么了
What is it?

384
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,140
哈维想让我逆推萨特的那些交易
Harvey wants me to reverse engineer Sutter's trades,

385
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,170
但没有交易数据库  我就做不到
but I can't do that without access to a trading database.

386
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,490
并且我们不能向证监会求助
And we can't ask the SEC

387
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,010
因为他们应该是我们的对手
because they're supposed to be on the other side.

388
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,120
那你为什么来找我了
So why are you coming to me?

389
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,540
因为斯图・二货脸・布齐尼有数据库
Because Stu "Dickface" Buzzini has a database.

390
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,490
然而他却是这世上最不愿意帮你的人
And he's the last person in the world who would help you.

391
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,970
求你了  唐娜  如果有别的办法
Donna, please, I would not be coming to you

392
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,720
我就不会来找你了
if there was another way,

393
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,760
我熬了一夜都没想出别的办法
but I have been up all night and there is no other way.

394
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,660
我会搞定的  路易
I'll take care of it, Louis.

395
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,820
-给  -这是什么
- Here. - What's this?

396
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,360
-我的人  -你的人
- That's my guy. - Your guy?

397
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,700
我的私家侦探
My private investigator.

398
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,340
名片上怎么没写
Why doesn't it say it on the card?

399
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,530
因为这么优秀的人用不着上电话簿
Because a guy that good isn't in the phone book.

400
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,690
瑞秋  达到某种层次后
Listen, Rachel, when you get to a certain level,

401
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,130
每个人都有自己的人
everybody has their person.

402
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,570
哈维有凡妮莎  我有卡特
Harvey has Vanessa, I have Carter.

403
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,750
现在也是我的了
And now I do too.

404
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,740
不  这次借你是因为我们时间不多了
No, you have him for this because we don't have time.

405
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,650
下一次  你去找你自己的人
After that, you get your own guy.

406
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,710
我不明白
I don't understand,

407
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,320
为什么不能跟你共用一个
why can't I use your guy too?

408
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,910
那还怎么能称得上是我的人
Because then he wouldn't be my guy.

409
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,250
有什么能为你效劳的  红发女郎
What can I do for you, Red?

410
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,400
我正忙着呢
I'm in the middle of something.

411
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,450
你可以把眼睛从屏幕上挪开两秒钟
You can turn away from that screen for two seconds

412
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,450
用绅士的方式自我介绍一下
and introduce yourself to me like a gentleman.

413
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,970
为什么你们办公室每次有人来找我
Why is it anytime someone from your office comes to me,

414
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,600
都要评论我的礼仪
they've always got some kind of comment on my manners?

415
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,360
也许这个问题你该问自己
Maybe that's a question you should be asking yourself.

416
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,570
但我没时间细究你为什么永远不会自己想
But I don't have time to delve into why you'll never do that

417
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,480
因为我需要你让路易・利特
because I need you to give Louis Litt access

418
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,180
查看你的整个证券数据库
to your entire securities database.

419
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,610
我不知道你是谁
Listen to me, I don't know who the hell you are,

420
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,630
但我为什么要为你这么做
but why exactly am I going to do that for you?

421
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,220
因为你这么做  我就欠你一个人情
Because when you do, I'll owe you one,

422
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,200
如果你还不知道那我告诉你
and if you don't know it already,

423
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,770
我欠你一次比别人五十次都好用
that's like anyone else owing you 50.

424
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,350
我不信
I don't buy it.

425
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,620
那你可以问问你在美林证券的朋友拉里
Then why don't you call your friend Larry at Merrill Lynch

426
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,900
或者摩根史坦利投资的肯尼
or Kenny at Morgan Stanley

427
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,680
或者霍华德・杰夫  你知道他在哪的
or Howard Jaffe from you know where?

428
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,500
你怎么知道霍华德的事的
How the hell do you know about Howard?

429
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,750
他们的事我都知道
I know about all of them.

430
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,060
这是我的专长
Because it's what I do.

431
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,200
好吧  你要什么都行
Okay, uh, you can have whatever you want.

432
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,640
很好  因为你质疑我的能力
Good. And sense you questioned my abilities,

433
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,740
所以你不但要给路易提供数据库
you're not only gonna give Louis that database,

434
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,440
还要在你的余生中  永远给他
you're going to treat him with the respect he deserves

435
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
应有的尊重
for the rest of your life.

436
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,950
我就没有欺负过他
I never did anything wrong to him.

437
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,890
如果你真信这句话
And if you think that's true,

438
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,220
那你真的需要好好照照镜子了
then you need to take a good look in the mirror

439
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,780
因为你玷污了他的大办公室和马克杯
because you violated his bullpen and his mugs.

440
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,470
而除了和我的友谊外
And with the exception of my friendship,

441
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,190
那是他生命中最重要的两个东西
those are the two most important things in his entire life.

442
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,140
你的表情告诉我
I can see by that look on your face

443
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,720
你终于在想我到底是谁了
you're wondering who I am after all.

444
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,110
我给你省点麻烦
Let me save you the trouble.

445
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,840
我是唐娜  我很厉害
I'm Donna, and I'm awesome.

446
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,500
抱歉  我想是我走错房间了
Excuse me. I think I'm in the wrong room.

447
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,750
不  没走错
No, you're not.

448
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,690
凯文呢
Where's Kevin?

449
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,450
我是他室友
I'm his cell mate

450
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,220
他在哪不是眼下最重要的问题
and where he is isn't important right now.

451
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,380
我接到了狱警的电话
I got a phone call from a guard

452
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,720
说我丈夫要见我
saying that my husband wanted to see me,

453
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,830
我要知道到底是怎么回事
and I want to know what's going on.

454
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,430
不  你是接到了一个说来自
No, you got a phone call from someone saying

455
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,740
丹伯里监狱的电话
they were calling from Danbury,

456
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,320
那通电话也确实是这里打出的
which is exactly where that call was made.

457
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,140
那我现在就要离开这个地方
And now it's exactly where I'm headed out of.

458
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,040
我知道你在帮你父亲进行非法交易
I know you're helping your father make illegal trades.

459
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,320
-什么  -你可以否认
- What? - You can go ahead and deny it,

460
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,680
但凯文都告诉我了
but Kevin told me everything.

461
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,210
你想怎样
What do you want?

462
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,140
我想帮你
I want to help you.

463
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,160
我不信
Well, I don't believe you.

464
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,460
我不在乎你信不信
I don't care if you believe it or not,

465
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,890
但你只有一个短暂的机会  可以向证监会自首
but you have a small window to come clean with the SEC

466
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,900
以免牢狱之灾
and save yourself.

467
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
虽然这不关你的事
Not that it's any of your business,

468
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,280
但我告诉你我不会背叛我父亲
but I would never turn on my own father.

469
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,580
真不幸  因为如果你不这么做
That's too bad because if you don't,

470
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,510
那你们俩都要进监狱
you're both gonna end up behind bars.

471
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,300
这事对你有什么好处
What exactly is in this for you?

472
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,250
对我没什么好处
There's nothing in it for me

473
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,440
我只是因为在乎凯文
besides that fact that I care about Kevin.

474
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,180
我曾为哈维・斯佩克特工作
Listen to me, I used to work for Harvey Specter,

475
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,200
他是你父亲的律师
your father's lawyer.

476
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,700
要是他知道我这么做了
If he found out that I was doing this,

477
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,860
肯定要杀了我
he would kill me.

478
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,660
要是我把这事告诉我父亲呢
And what if I tell my father about all this?

479
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,750
你不会的
You're not gonna do that.

480
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,210
因为凯文已经告诉我
Because Kevin already told me

481
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,430
你们打算拿着威廉的钱离开
that you guys are planning to go away on William's dime,

482
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,550
要是你父亲发现凯文告诉了我
so if your father finds out that Kevin's been talking to me,

483
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,000
就不会给你们钱了
that dime's gonna go away.

484
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,010
我说了  我走错房间了
Like I said, I'm in the wrong room.

485
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,400
坐吧  布莱恩
Have a seat, Bryan.

486
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,550
我问几个问题
I just have a few questions,

487
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,860
然后你就可以走了
and then you can be on your way.

488
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,820
到底是要问什么
What exactly is this about?

489
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,810
-你还不知道  -不知道
- You don't know? - No.

490
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,720
我问了十个人谁也不告诉我什么
I talked to ten people here and no one will tell me a thing

491
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,960
只是说不好对付
except that this isn't going to be easy.

492
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,630
因为有人匿名
That's because the SEC

493
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,180
向证监会递交了威廉・萨特的交易软件
got an anonymous copy of William Sutter's trading program,

494
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,300
我要知道是哪个混蛋泄露的
and I want to find the son of a bitch who leaked it.

495
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,650
我可以告诉你不是我
Well, I can tell you it wasn't me.

496
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,080
前面那十个白痴也是这么说的
Which is exactly what those ten other clowns just said.

497
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,510
我也把给他们的答案再给你
And I'll tell you what I told them,

498
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,610
那东西不是从天上掉进证监会的
it didn't magically appear on their doorstep.

499
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,230
我不管他们是怎么拿到的
I don't care how they got it.

500
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,360
如果你只有这一个问题
And if that's your only question,

501
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,600
那我要回去工作了
I need to get back to work.

502
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,530
我说让你走  你才能走
You'll leave when I say you can leave.

503
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,500
你说什么
What did you say?

504
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,320
我说让你给我坐下
I said sit the hell down.

505
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,500
你当了五年副经理
You've been a VP for five years,

506
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,190
但是去年夏天你见过高盛和摩根的人
but you took meetings at Goldman and Morgan last summer.

507
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,740
这件事我告诉过萨特先生
Which I disclosed to Mr. Sutter.

508
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,510
我不管  你没得到工作
I don't care. You didn't get those jobs

509
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,690
是因为他们不要你
because they didn't want you.

510
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,770
你现在很生气  因为那些级别比你低的人
And now you're pissed off the people under you

511
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,490
却能拿到你两倍的工资
are making twice your salary,

512
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,340
所以你跑去证监会告密
so you went running to the SEC.

513
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,550
我已经说了我没有
I already told you I didn't do that.

514
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,650
三天前的晚上你在哪
Where were you three nights ago?

515
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,810
在吃饭  你可以查
I was at dinner. You can check.

516
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,470
是和你的老朋友亨利・里瑟吗
Was it with your old buddy, Henry Reese,

517
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,160
而他恰巧和五名证监会的律师
who just happens to play rec-league basketball

518
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,810
一起打篮球联赛
with five SEC lawyers?

519
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,560
我已经半年没见过亨利了
I haven't seen Henry in six months,

520
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,670
而且我也有点受够了你的审问了
and I'm getting a little sick and tired of this interrogation.

521
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,630
我也受够了你这种
Well, I'm getting sick and tired of assholes like you

522
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,190
不把这件事当真的混蛋了
not taking this thing seriously.

523
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,640
什么  我没说过我不当真
What? I didn't say I wasn't taking it seriously.

524
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,280
对  我不在乎你说过什么
Yeah, I don't give a shit what you said.

525
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,100
我在乎的是
I give a shit that

526
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,050
你要开始认真听我说的话
you start listening to what I'm goddamn telling you

527
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,180
因为当证监会让你出庭作证的时候
because when the SEC gets you on the stand,

528
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,610
他们会用放大镜把你的生活翻个底朝天
they're going to go through your life with a fine tooth comb,

529
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,570
如果你有任何隐瞒
and if you got something to hide,

530
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,830
他们都会查出来
they're gonna find it.

531
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,830
-对不起  -很好
- I'm sorry. - Good.

532
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,220
从我眼前消失  叫下一个混蛋进来
Get the hell out of my sight and send the next asshole in.

533
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,970
路易  我能跟你说句话吗
Louis, can I talk to you for a minute?

534
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,340
如果你带来了我想要的东西的话
Only if you're here to bring me what I need.

535
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,400
我带了
I am.

536
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,550
这个小东西能让你直接链接到我们的主机
That baby will link you directly to our mainframe.

537
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,200
如果你还需要其他东西  来找我
You need anything else, you come to me.

538
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,860
-谢谢你  -不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

539
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,390
还没完
But that's not all.

540
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,410
我还带了另一个小礼物
I also brought a little something

541
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,430
来弥补我们的关系
to make things right between us.

542
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,220
我自作主张更新了设计
I took the liberty of updating the design.

543
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,640
希望你喜欢
I hope you like it.

544
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,510
我爱死它了
I love it.

545
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,710
很好  因为档案室还有六打杯子呢
Good. 'Cause there's six dozen more in the file room.

546
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,120
重新开始  兄弟
Fresh start, bro?

547
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,210
重新开始
Fresh start.

548
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,270
斯图
Hey, Stu.

549
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,500
唐娜说了什么让你做出此番举动的
What exactly did Donna say to get you to do all this?

550
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,930
她只是给我立了面镜子
She just held up a mirror.

551
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,360
事实上  在待人处事方面听取他人的意见
And the truth is, it never hurts to get a second opinion

552
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,800
并不是件坏事
on how you treat other people.

553
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,620
杰西卡  你给我卡特的名片是对的
Jessica, you were right to give me Carter.

554
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,780
没有他我绝对发现不了
I never would have found out

555
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,410
玛利亚・戈麦斯的情况
what happened to Maria Gomez without him.

556
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,110
说说看
Let's have it.

557
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,120
她2008年在新泽西提交了更改名字的文件
She filed for a name change in New Jersey in 2008.

558
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,230
她的新名字叫什么
What's her new name?

559
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,210
这就是问题所在
That's just it.

560
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,680
卡特找不到她的新名字
Carter couldn't get it.

561
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,530
他找不到的唯一原因
The only reason he couldn't get it

562
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,940
是州政府考虑到她的安全拒绝任何人
is if the state is denying access to those records

563
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,590
-接触这份记录  -没错
- for her own safety. - Exactly.

564
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,280
她提交了大量对他丈夫的限制令
She filed numerous restraining orders against her ex-husband,

565
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,170
现在她的文件在接下来两年里都将是保密的
and now her records are sealed for the next two years.

566
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,930
好吧  让我找找看
All right. I'll see if there's someone

567
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,760
纽瓦克地检办公室有没有人能帮忙
at the Newark DA's office who can help us.

568
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,800
如果我没有  也许哈维能有认识的人
If not, maybe Harvey knows someone.

569
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,980
我认识一个
I know someone.

570
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,220
我父亲和吉米・罗杰斯一起上的法学院
My father went to law school with Jim Rogers,

571
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,200
他是纽瓦克的地检官
the Newark District Attorney.

572
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,840
你不想去找你父亲
And you don't want to go to your father

573
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,510
是因为你不想找他帮忙
because you don't want to ask him for a favor.

574
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,910
我不想让他一直我当成
I don't want him to keep seeing me as

575
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,860
一个总是需要帮助的小姑娘
some little girl who's always asking for help with something.

576
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,740
瑞秋  身为律师意味着你需要寻求他人帮助
Rachel, being a lawyer means you have to ask people for help,

577
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,210
不论他们是谁
no matter who they are,

578
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,350
也就是说如果你想让你父亲知道
which means if you want to let your father know

579
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,090
你不再是一个小姑娘了
that you're not a little girl anymore,

580
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,690
那你要让他知道你不怕求他帮忙
then show him you're not afraid to ask him for a favor.

581
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,870
请坐  詹妮弗
Have a seat, Jennifer.

582
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,150
我就问几个问题
I just have a few questions,

583
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,250
你就可以走了
then you can be on your way.

584
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,530
我想我还是站着吧
I think I'll stand.

585
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,360
-你不是詹妮弗  -对  我不是
- You're not Jennifer. - No, I'm not.

586
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,780
在告诉我你到底打的什么算盘之前
I'm not sending another person in here

587
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,390
我不会让任何人进来的
until you tell me what the hell you're doing.

588
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,570
我在做我之前说过要做的事情
I'm doing what I said I was gonna do.

589
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,130
你说你要试探军情
You said you would shake the trees,

590
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,490
而不是动摇军心
not burn down the whole forest.

591
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,250
-听我说  -不  你听我说
- Listen to me-- - No, you listen to me.

592
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,760
你是在赶走我的手下  这件事到此为止
You're driving my people away, and that ends now.

593
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,410
威廉  你不懂
William, I don't think you understand,

594
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,630
那个泄露机密的贱人越早停止
the sooner the son of a bitch who leaked this thing

595
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,380
和他们的合作
stops helping them,

596
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,230
对我们越有利
the better for us.

597
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,710
你凭什么认为这个人
What makes you think whoever it is

598
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,890
会停止和他们的合作
is gonna stop helping them?

599
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,840
他是匿名递交的材料
Look, they handed it in anonymously,

600
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,620
也就是说不管这个混蛋是谁
which means whoever this asshole is,

601
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,480
这件事告诉我们的是  他是个胆小鬼
the one thing they showed us is, he's a coward.

602
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,410
阻止胆小鬼的唯一办法
And the only way to stop a coward

603
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,330
就是吓死他们
is to scare the shit out of them.

604
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,590
如果赢意味着失去我所有的员工
Well, if winning my case means losing all my employees,

605
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,850
那这整件事就算了吧
then forget about the whole thing.

606
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,230
-威廉  我们不能停止...  -够了
- William, we can't stop-- - That's enough.

607
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,170
你现在不应该是寻找一个
Instead of looking for someone

608
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,800
已经发生的事实的罪魁祸首
who did something they already did,

609
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,680
而应该是回去为我的辩护做准备
you're gonna get back to preparing my defense.

610
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,140
下次我见到你
The next time I see you,

611
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,260
你最好给我一个前所未有的最有力的
you'd better be giving the most kick-ass opening statement

612
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,540
开庭陈诉
the world's ever seen.

613
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,950
你到底干了什么
What the hell did you do?

614
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,060
凯文  听我解释
All right, Kevin, let me explain.

615
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,750
解释什么  冒充我叫我妻子
Explain what? That you called my wife in here

616
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,680
来这里吗
pretending to be me?

617
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,490
先听我说  我...
Just listen to me, I'm--

618
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,400
我不能相信你
You know, I can't believe you, man.

619
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,720
我叫你不要把我们说过的话告诉任何人
I told you not to tell anyone what we talked about.

620
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,420
我也并没有告诉其他人啊
And I didn't tell anyone who didn't already know.

621
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,540
我才不管
And I don't give a shit

622
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,230
因为这不关你他妈一点事
because this is none of your goddamn business.

623
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,870
是  但我让它变成了我的事
Yeah, well, I made it my goddamn business

624
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,550
因为你现在面前正有一辆货车向你驶来
because there is a freight train headed right at you,

625
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,050
如果我不做点什么阻止它
and if I didn't do everything I could to stop it,

626
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:02,890
我良心过不去
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

627
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,140
但你并没有阻止它
Yeah, well, you didn't stop it.

628
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,220
而是直接用它来破坏我的婚姻
You slammed it right into my marriage

629
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,890
因为我和吉尔
because Jill and I,

630
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,120
自打我进监狱的那一晚开始
we haven't fought like we just did

631
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,520
就没有像刚才那样大吵过
since the night that landed me in here,

632
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,360
所以从现在开始
so from now on,

633
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,340
带起你的好心好意给我滚
take your goddamn good intentions and go to hell.

634
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,910
你知道吗  你应该感谢我
You know what? You should be thanking me.

635
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,190
感谢你什么  破坏我的人生吗
Thanking you for what? Screwing up my life?

636
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,260
提醒你一句  你的人生已经被破坏了
In case you haven't noticed, your life is already screwed up.

637
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,200
你替人顶罪进了这里
You're in here because of some other guy's crime,

638
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,990
如果那个人被抓  你们会一起在监狱度过余生
and if he gets caught, you're gonna be in here together.

639
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,810
然后那些他承诺要给你的
And then all of that fictional money

640
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,140
虚拟的金钱
that he's dangling in front of you

641
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,530
都会打水漂
isn't gonna be there anymore.

642
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,740
现在我懂你为什么费心做这些事了
Now I get why you're going through all this trouble.

643
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,180
你后悔为别人做了交易
You regret that you took a deal for someone,

644
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,030
他现在逍遥法外而你却在蹲监狱
and he's out there while you're in here.

645
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,090
我并不后悔
Well, I don't.

646
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,230
因为我不是为了那个杂种进了监狱
Because I didn't take this deal for that son of a bitch,

647
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,370
我进来是为了我很爱的妻子
I took it for my wife, who I love,

648
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,160
如果你再未经我的允许找她
and if you ever contact her again without my blessing,

649
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,640
我对天发誓我会痛扁你
I swear to God I will beat the shit out of you.

650
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,970
唐娜  路易在哪
Donna, where the hell is Louis?

651
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,170
他在给你干活
He's working on what you wanted.

652
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,060
有事  去把他找来
Well, find him because I need him.

653
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,200
哈利  有什么问题吗
Harvey, what's the matter?

654
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,670
问题是  我在萨特的公司花了一整天
What's the matter is, I just spent the whole day at Sutter's

655
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,790
想要找到是谁跟他共谋了
trying to flush out whoever's in on this with him,

656
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,140
但一无所获
and I got nowhere.

657
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,770
我不懂  这肯定需要时间的
I don't understand. It's gonna take time.

658
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,740
这才过了一天
This was only one day.

659
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,910
没错  但萨特不让我这么做了
Which would be true, except Sutter shut me down

660
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,160
所以我没有机会去找了
and I don't have another day.

661
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,030
我也说了  我在那里时
And like I said, while I was there,

662
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,550
并没有在任何人的脸上看到负罪的表情
I didn't see a guilty look on a single person's face.

663
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,810
因为你要找的那个人
Because the person you're looking for

664
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,290
并不为威廉・萨特工作
doesn't work for William Sutter.

665
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,370
我去  你找到他了吗
Holy shit. You found him?

666
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,180
我不仅找到了他  我还有证据
I didn't just find him. I got backup.

667
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,020
萨特所交易的这些资金的一个共同点是
The one commonality on all the trades Sutter made money on

668
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,980
他们是通过和一个投资银行
was they preceded some sort of transaction

669
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,230
进行这些交易的
involving an investment bank.

670
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,090
这我知道  但是有20个不同的银行
I know that, but there were 50 different trades

671
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,200
牵涉了50桩不同的交易
with 20 different banks.

672
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,460
是20个不同的代理银行
20 different agent banks.

673
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,250
银行还有其他种类吗
What the hell other kind of bank is there?

674
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,360
用来给你第二意见的银行
The kind of bank you hire to give you a second opinion.

675
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,180
我去  咨询银行
Holy shit, the consulting banks.

676
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,360
正是  而且它们
Exactly, which, by the way,

677
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,110
并不要求被公开
are not required to be disclosed.

678
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,350
有多少咨询银行 
How many different banks were they?

679
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,440
就一个  而主管这个银行咨询部的人
Just one. And that bank's consulting division

680
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,760
他在华尔街第一份工作的老板
happens to be run by a man whose first job on Wall Street

681
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,090
正是威廉・萨特
was working for William Sutter.

682
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,430
抱歉又来打扰你  肖恩
Sorry to be showing up at your place again, Sean,

683
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,930
但是这耽搁不得
but this can't wait.

684
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,990
没事  哈维  我现在心情正好
That's okay, Harvey. You caught me in a good mood.

685
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,620
我会让你的心情更好
Well, I'm about to make it better

686
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,260
因为我们已经找到
because we found the guy

687
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,200
那个向萨特提供信息的人了
who's been feeding Sutter his information.

688
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,020
-他是...  -菲利普・亚伦  我知道
- His name is-- - Phillip Allen, I know.

689
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,150
你怎么知道
How do you know?

690
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,780
两个小时前他来找我签协议
He came by to cut a deal two hours ago,

691
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,540
我跟他签了
so I gave him one.

692
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,720
-不  你没有  -有什么问题吗
- No, you goddamn didn't. - What's your problem?

693
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,800
问题是  他来找你是因为我
My problem is, I drove him to you.

694
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,740
那又怎样  这事儿就快结束了  哈维
So what? We're at the finish line, Harvey.

695
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,210
这就是我们一直想要的结果
This is what we've been after the whole time.

696
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,780
这是你一直想要的结果
This is what you've been after this whole time.

697
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,610
我想要的结果是救出迈克
What I've been after is getting Mike out,

698
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,640
如果你觉得你能够就这样逃避交易
so if you think you can weasel out of this deal after--

699
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,100
哈维  冷静
Harvey, relax.

700
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,460
就证监会而言
As far as the SEC is concerned,

701
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,940
迈克直接指向那位证人
Mike led directly to the witness.

702
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,130
这将让那个该死的混蛋的余生
That's going to put that piece of shit away

703
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,880
都在监狱中悲惨的度过
for the rest of his miserable life.

704
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,430
所以迈克的协议依然有效吗
So Mike's deal is still intact?

705
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,590
坚如磐石
Rock solid.

706
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,540
我们逮到他了  哈维
We got him, Harvey.

707
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,960
最终还是好人赢了
The good guys won.

708
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,340
那么我猜你下次见到我
Then I guess the next time you see me,

709
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,910
我得装作对你没有告知我们
I'm gonna be pretending to be outraged

710
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,040
你有新证人这件事感到愤怒和震惊了
that you hadn't notified us of your new witness.

711
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,400
而我会对不管你扯的什么淡
And I'll be pretending to be outraged

712
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,930
也都装作愤怒和震惊
at whatever bullshit you're trying to pull.

713
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,770
好吧  我尽量试着不弄得太夸张
Well, I'll try not to be too outrageous.

714
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,870
就这么办吧
You do that.

715
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,170
-谢谢  肖恩  -不客气  哈维
- Thanks, Sean. - You're welcome, Harvey.

716
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,770
瑞秋
Rachel.

717
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,360
是我记错了吗
Did I mess something up?

718
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,070
我不记得我们今晚有约啊
I didn't think we had plans tonight.

719
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,690
我不是因为和你有约才过来的
I'm not here for plans.

720
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,660
那你过来是要做什么
Then what are you here for?

721
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,820
我有个案子需要你帮忙
I need your help with a case.

722
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,380
你不是真的要叫我帮我的对手吧
You're not seriously asking me to help my rival firm, are you?

723
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,850
不  不是商业案件
No, it's not corporate.

724
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,950
是无罪计划的案子
This is from the Innocence Project

725
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,430
从什么时候开始杰西卡・皮尔逊
And since when did Jessica Pearson

726
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,050
会接无罪计划的案子了
take on an Innocence Project case?

727
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,500
从我请求她这么做开始
Since I asked her to.

728
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,850
真棒  瑞秋  我为你感到骄傲
Well, that's great, Rachel. I'm proud of you.

729
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:57,810
你需要我帮什么忙
What do you need?

730
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,990
在新泽西州有一条隐私权法令
There's a privacy statute in the state of New Jersey

731
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,530
阻碍了我去找一位目击证人
that's preventing me from finding a witness.

732
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,550
而吉米・罗杰斯是不会接你的电话的
And Jim Rogers won't take a call from you,

733
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,400
但他会接我的
but he will from me.

734
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,250
完全正确  如果你帮我这一次
Exactly. And if you do this for me,

735
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,710
我就欠你一份情
I will owe you one.

736
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,140
瑞秋  你是我女儿  你永远不欠我的
Rachel, you're my daughter. You'll never owe me one.

737
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,930
我不是以你女儿的身份来的
Mm-mm. I'm not here as your daughter.

738
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,920
我是以一位律师的身份来的
I'm here as a lawyer.

739
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,540
那就不要忘了这一点
Then don't forget this.

740
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,750
因为有一天  我会找你帮忙的
Because someday, I'm gonna come calling.

741
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,000
迈克  坐
Mike, sit down.

742
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,190
我希望你大老远跑来
I hope you didn't come all the way down here

743
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,950
不是过来告诉我时间不多了
just to tell me that we're running out of time,

744
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,310
因为这一点我已经知道了
'cause I already know that.

745
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,220
并不是  我来是想告诉你我们逮到那家伙了
I didn't. I came here to tell you that we got the guy.

746
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,620
-谁  -那个一直给萨特提供
- What guy? - The guy who's been feeding

747
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,580
内幕消息的人  我把他逼去找卡荷尔了
inside information to Sutter, and I drove him to Cahill,

748
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,570
也就是意味着你要出狱了
which means you're getting out.

749
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,870
迈克  你听到我说的话了吗  你要出狱了
Mike, did you hear me? You're getting out.

750
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,400
不  我  我知道  我
No, I-I know. I...

751
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,250
听着  问题是如果你要给萨特定罪
Look, the problem is that if you're gonna get Sutter,

752
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,990
就同样会牵连到凯文的妻子
you're also gonna get Kevin's wife.

753
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,480
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

754
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,380
凯文跟我说他一直不接受交易的原因
Kevin told me that the reason he never cut a deal

755
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,000
就是因为她妻子也牵连其中
was because his wife was in on it.

756
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,650
你跟我开玩笑吗  你一直把这件事自己瞒着
Are you kidding me? You've been keeping this to yourself?

757
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,720
我没有只是自己瞒着
I haven't just been keeping it to myself.

758
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,460
我也在试图说服凯文和吉尔坦白一切
I also tried to convince Kevin and Jill to both come clean.

759
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,760
他们俩  你去找她了吗
Both of them? You went to her?

760
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,450
-哈维  听我说  -不  你听我说
- Harvey, listen to me-- - No, you listen to me.

761
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,850
我不在乎你的良心在告诉你该怎么做
I don't give a shit what your conscience is telling you.

762
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,780
我们逮到这家伙了  我们要把他拿下
We got the guy. We're gonna take him down.

763
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
那意味着你可以出狱了
That means you get out.

764
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,690
我知道  我也很想这样
I know that, and I love that.

765
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,320
但我需要你去说服卡荷尔
But all I need you to do is convince Cahill

766
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,020
也跟吉尔做个交易
to cut Jill a deal too.

767
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,120
我觉得你没搞清楚
I don't think you understand.

768
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,640
这家伙自首了
This guy came forward.

769
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,250
他得到了这笔交易
He's the guy that gets the deal,

770
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,240
你也得到了这笔交易
and you're the guy that gets the deal.

771
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,660
-没有第三笔交易了  -哈维  拜托
- There's no third deal. - Harvey, please.

772
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,030
我背叛这个男人的事已经做得够多了
I've betrayed this man enough.

773
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,530
我需要你去说服卡荷尔一个证人可以搞定案子
I need you to convince Cahill that one person makes a case,

774
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,650
但两个证人能让他胜券在握
but two people is a slam dunk.

775
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,090
好吧  迈克  我去说服卡荷尔
Okay, Mike. I'll make it happen.

776
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,500
路易  有空吗
Louis? Do you have a second?

777
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,880
实际上  我没空  唐娜  因为我今晚
Actually, I don't, Donna, because I'm going

778
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,360
即将要去赴我人生中最重要的约会
on the most important date of my life tonight,

779
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,220
但我却完全不知道要带她去哪
and I have no idea where I'm taking her.

780
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,400
是的  你知道
Yes, you do.

781
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
从来没听过这个地方
Never heard of this place.

782
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,180
那是因为这是一家在那里已经开了
That's because it's an intimate restaurant

783
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,480
50年却没什么人知道的私密餐厅
that's been there 50 years and no one knows about it.

784
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,390
这让其作为一个去了解你认为可能
Which makes it the perfect place to get to know someone

785
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,850
会爱上的那个人的约会场所来说再好不过了
you think you might be falling in love with.

786
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,450
唐娜  我要震撼到她
Donna, I need to blow her away.

787
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,740
不  路易  你得让她去了解你
No, Louis, you need to let her get to know you

788
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,960
然后让命运决定接下来的一切
and let fate take care of the rest.

789
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,130
如果我不够好呢
What if I'm not good enough?

790
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,200
你足够好了
You are good enough.

791
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
我以为你太忙没时间帮忙
Hey, I thought you were too busy to help.

792
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,940
事实上  你叫我帮忙的时候
The truth is, when you asked me for help,

793
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,520
那个早晨我心情不好  不愿意去
it wasn't a great morning for me to be thinking

794
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,930
思考恋爱的事
about that kind of thing.

795
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,140
我不大明白
I don't understand.

796
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,010
我过去几个月一直在和某人交往
I've been seeing someone for the last few months,

797
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,460
我们分手了
and we broke up.

798
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,700
把那个混账的名字告诉我
Tell me the son of a bitch's name right now

799
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,500
本周结束之前我就把他的账户给冻结了
and I'm gonna freeze his assets by the end of the week.

800
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,390
他叫米歇尔  你没必要这么做
His name is Mitchell, and you don't have to do that.

801
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,130
有必要  唐娜  你是我最重要的人
Yes, I do, Donna. You're everything to me,

802
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,390
那个混账完全不知道自己多大福气...
and that asshole has no idea what he's got--

803
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,970
是我提出分手的  路易
It was my decision, Louis.

804
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,320
那你怎么这么伤心
Well then, why were you so upset?

805
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,800
这道理和你跟希拉的关系是一样的啊
It's the same thing it was with you and Sheila.

806
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,330
尽管你是先提出分手的人
Just because you were the one to break it off with her

807
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,640
也不意味着你不会伤心
doesn't mean that your heart wasn't still broken.

808
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,870
我爱你  唐娜
I love you, Donna.

809
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,070
我也爱你  路易
I love you too, Louis.

810
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,630
先生  有什么能帮您的吗
Sir, may I help you?

811
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,220
有  你带我去见杰西卡・皮尔逊
Yes, you can direct me to Jessica Pearson.

812
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,820
皮尔逊女士晚上不在这里
Ms. Pearson's gone for the evening,

813
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,260
我能替你转达消息
but I can take down your information

814
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,690
明天早上她就会回复你了
and she'll get back to you in the morning.

815
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,860
你不用转达任何消息
You're not taking anything down.

816
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,610
我需要立刻跟人对上话
I need to speak with someone now.

817
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,670
有事你可以对我说  福雷斯特先生
You can speak with me, Mr. Forrest.

818
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,070
我想你来这是要说伦纳德・贝利的事
I assume you're here to talk about Leonard Bailey.

819
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,490
我是来给你看这个的
I'm here to show you this.

820
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,950
这是那个男人对我女儿所犯下的罪行
This is what that man did to my daughter.

821
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,390
福雷斯特先生  我知道你很难过
Mr. Forrest, I know that this must be incredibly difficult.

822
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,530
也许你不这么想
And it may not seem that way to you,

823
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,900
但我是在为你女儿寻求公正的判决
but I am seeking justice for your daughter.

824
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,400
只有那个禽兽被判死刑才是最公正的判决
We got justice when that animal was sentenced to death,

825
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,920
别跟我说这样做是为了她
so don't you try to tell me you're doing this for her.

826
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,400
我这样做是为了所有人
I'm doing this for everyone.

827
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,250
这个案子曾被严重地错误处理了
The case was grossly mishandled.

828
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,110
-这不是你能决定的  -说的没错  先生
- That's not for you to decide. - You're right, sir.

829
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,220
-这是陪审团该决定的  -陪审团也判过了
- It's for a jury to decide. - A jury did decide!

830
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,310
他们当时并未看到所有真相
And they weren't presented with all of the facts.

831
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,260
真相就是他杀了我女儿
The facts are he killed my girl!

832
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,070
福雷斯特先生  我很同情你
Mr. Forrest, I'm so sorry for your loss.

833
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,140
但我发自内心地相信伦纳德・贝利是无辜的
But I believe in my heart that Leonard Bailey is innocent.

834
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,470
而我要确保
And I'm going to make sure

835
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,510
他能得到自己从未有过的公正判决
that he gets the fair trial that he never had.

836
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,360
方法就是找些瘾君子来做证人吗
By tracking down some junkie witness?

837
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,580
无论她是不是瘾君子
Drug user or not,

838
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,800
玛利亚・戈麦斯以前都没有机会说出证词
Maria Gomez never had a chance to be heard.

839
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,640
如果你不介意的话  我得回办公室了
If you'll excuse me, I need to go to my office.

840
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,280
我不会离开的
I'm not going anywhere!

841
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,040
除非你意识到如果你真的同情我
Not until you understand that if you are sorry for me,

842
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,870
当初就不会接这个案子
you wouldn't have taken this case on in the first place

843
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,430
不会为了名声而接这个案子
instead of using it to make a name for yourself.

844
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,330
够了
That's enough.

845
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,560
你该说的都说完了
You said everything you needed to say,

846
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,160
请你马上离开这里
now walk yourself out of here

847
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,590
不然我就叫保安来了
before I have security remove you.

848
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,660
你没事吧
You all right?

849
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,810
会没事的  谢谢你  格雷琴
I will be. Thank you, Gretchen.

850
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,000
我们能谈谈吗
Can we talk?

851
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,710
没什么好谈的
There's nothing to talk about.

852
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,910
-我有  -好吧  随你谈
- There is for me. - All right then, go ahead.

853
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:55,710
反正也没用
It won't make any difference

854
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,620
因为我已经准备换牢房了
'cause I already put in for a transfer.

855
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,160
-你要搬走了吗  -没错
- You're moving to another cell? - Yeah, I am.

856
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,950
所以无论你说了什么
So whatever it is you're gonna say,

857
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,920
我都会假装你说完了  并且忘光
let's just pretend you said it, and I let it go,

858
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,230
之后咱们各走各道互不相见  可以吗
and we move in our separate directions, okay?

859
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,540
不  我没法这么做
No, I can't do that.

860
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,920
-为什么  -因为你说得对
- Why not? - Because you were right.

861
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,830
我气自己接受协议来救别人
I am pissed that I took a deal to save other people.

862
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,910
如今我要在牢里呆上两年
And now I'm sitting in here for two goddamn years

863
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,000
他们却逍遥自在
while they're out there.

864
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,710
如果你还是想搬走  我能理解
If you still want to transfer cells,I get it.

865
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,090
我不会心存芥蒂的
I won't hold any hard feelings.

866
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,850
我想让你知道  伤害你和吉尔
I want you to know that hurting you and Jill

867
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,720
是我最不想做的事情
is the last thing that I wanted to do.

868
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,610
我今晚会去看电影
I'm gonna head to movie night.

869
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,020
希望能在那里见到你
I hope to see you there.

870
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,200
杰西卡  你不是回家过夜了吗
Jessica, I thought you went home for the night.

871
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,670
我又回来了
I came back.

872
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,720
听说受害者父亲来找你麻烦了
I heard you had some trouble with the victim's father.

873
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,730
-格雷琴跟你说了  -没错
- Gretchen told you. - Yes, she did.

874
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,010
还好她跟我说了
And I'm glad she did.

875
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,740
-他有威胁你吗  -没
- Did he threaten you? - No.

876
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,630
我当初应该先跟你说
I guess I should have told you.

877
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,030
人们在经历悲痛的时候往往不太理智
People don't always act rationally when they're suffering.

878
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,880
他们想找人来怪罪
They look for someone to blame.

879
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,160
-于是就怪罪在我身上  -没错
- Yeah, well, he's blaming me. - Yes, he is.

880
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
-他错了  -我知道
- And he's wrong. - I know.

881
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,470
这事要理解起来很容易
And that's an easy thing to understand.

882
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,250
但要忍受却很难
But a harder thing to endure.

883
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,870
好吧  一想到有你支持我
Well, it just got a little bit easier

884
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,310
我感觉好受了一点
knowing that you're in it with me.

885
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,630
我们去喝杯酒吧
Let's go get a drink.

886
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,530
发生了这么多事  一杯可不够我喝的
After what happened before, I think I might have two.

887
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,600
-路易  这个地方...  -太静了是不是
- Louis, this place is...  - It's too quiet in here,isn't it?

888
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,550
椅子上还没垫子
The seats aren't padded.

889
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:55,100
-你讨厌这里  我就知道  -不  这里很完美
- And you hate it, I know it. - No, Louis, it's perfect.

890
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,350
这里完全符合我的期望
It's exactly what I'd hoped for.

891
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,330
我想让你知道我有多在乎你
Well, I wanted to show you how much you mean to me.

892
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,600
-路易...  -我明白
- Louis... - I get it.

893
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,540
-你对我没感觉  -不是那样的
- You don't feel the same way. - It's not that.

894
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,870
我有些事告诉你
I have something to tell you,

895
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,360
我不知该从何说起
and I didn't know how to bring it up.

896
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,300
也不知该什么时候说
Or even when,

897
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,680
但你表现的这么浪漫
but you made such a romantic gesture

898
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,750
让我觉得不说都对不起你
that it--it feels wrong not to tell you about it.

899
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,450
说什么
What is it?

900
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,690
我有男朋友并且他每年一半时间住在洛杉矶
I have a boyfriend who lives in Los Angeles six months of the year.

901
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,560
我们非常看重彼此
We care about each other deeply,

902
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,000
但是异地恋对我们的感情影响很大
but living across the country takes its toll.

903
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:35,070
所以我们约好了
So we came up with an arrangement

904
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,100
彼此可以和其他人约会
where we allow each other to see other people.

905
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,170
你是说你想同时和我们两个交往
You're saying you want to date both of us?

906
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,920
我知道这听起来很疯狂
I know it sounds crazy.

907
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:50,100
其实  我从来都没有真正履行这个约定
The truth is, I've never actually taken him up on it.

908
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:55,170
直到遇到你  就走到了现在这一步
But then I met you, and here we are.

909
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,390
路易  拜托说句话
Louis, please say something.

910
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,030
给我点时间
I need a second.

911
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,950
如果你要走我完全理解
I-I understand if you want to go.

912
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:16,250
不  我愿意留下来
No. I'd like to stay.

913
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,750
你想去吃顿饭还是就喝点酒
Do you want to go for dinner or just drinks?

914
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,830
你想要什么
What do you want?

915
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,990
说实话吗  我宁愿找个小酒吧喝酒
The truth? I'd rather just go to a dive bar.

916
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,380
听起来不错
Sounds perfect to me.

917
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,240
爸爸  你来这做什么
Dad? What are you doing here?

918
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,150
我来跟你们俩谈谈
I came to talk to both of you.

919
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,050
什么事
What is it?

920
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,370
吉米・罗杰斯找到了你们要找的失踪的证人
Jim Rogers found your missing witness.

921
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,390
她三年前去世了
She died three years ago.

922
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,550
瞧瞧谁来了
Hey, look who it is.

923
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,320
我正要去电影之夜活动  加洛
I'm headed to movie night, Gallo.

924
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,330
我没时间在这纠缠
I don't have time for this.

925
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,600
不会花很多时间
This will just take a second.

926
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,700
你连片头都不会错过
I won't even make you miss the previews.

927
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,220
那我们赶紧说清楚完事
Let's get this over with.

928
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,780
我发现
It's been brought to my attention

929
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,390
今天哈维又一次来探望你而不是我
that Harvey came to visit you, not me, again today.

930
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,550
就像我之前跟你说的
And like I told you,

931
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,830
他来这是讨论我的案件
he came here to talk about my case.

932
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,620
你上次也是这么说的
Yeah, that's what you said the last time.

933
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,560
但我在想
But I got to thinking.

934
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,700
你已经达成了协议
And the thing is, you took a deal,

935
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,600
也就意味着你没有案件要考虑
which means you don't have a case.

936
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,470
加洛  我告诉你
Gallo, look, I'm telling you,

937
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,360
哈维正努力把你弄出去
Harvey is going to get you out.

938
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,550
这我知道
I know he is.

939
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,630
因为我知道你在这里做什么
Because I know what you're up to in here.

940
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,480
我知道的原因是因为我也在做同样的事
And the reason I know is because I did the same thing myself.

941
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,850
-你说什么呢  -你要告发你的室友
- What are you talking-- - You're informing on your roommate.

942
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,310
你都不知道自己在说什么  这是
You don't know what you're talking about. This is--

943
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,950
是吗  这里的每个人都知道
Don't I? Everybody in here knows

944
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,100
那家伙有事隐瞒
that guy's taken it out.

945
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,850
是个人都能想到你有机会知道真相
It doesn't take a genius to figure out you have access to him.

946
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,280
所以我调查了一下
So I did some checking.

947
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:45,290
原来哈维现在是那孩子岳父的代理
Turns out Harvey's representing the kid's daddy-in-law.

948
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,360
而我知道哈维会耍阴谋诡计
And I know Harvey does dirty tricks

949
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,920
因为他就是这么把我弄进来的
because that's what landed me in here.

950
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,090
-加洛  -你们想抓萨特
- Gallo-- - You guys are going after Sutter.

951
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,420
我很清楚  你也清楚
I know it, and you know it.

952
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,480
我还要告诉你
And I'll tell you something else,

953
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,970
你不快点把我弄出去
you don't get me out of here soon,

954
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,350
你的室友也要知道了
your bunkmate's gonna know it too.

955
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,770
肖恩  很好  你在这
Sean, good, you're here.

956
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,020
我需要你帮我做件事
I need you to do something for me

957
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,880
不过这事你不会很喜欢
and you're not gonna like it.

958
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,270
哈维  你先坐下
Harvey, I need you to sit down.

959
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,860
什么意思  干嘛要坐下
What do you mean, sit down?

960
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,800
他们取消了与迈克的交易
They pulled Mike's deal.

961
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,350
-你刚说什么  -哈维
- What did you just say to me? - Harvey--

962
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,530
因为你刚说的听起来
'Cause it sounded like you just said

963
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,370
就像你告诉我即使坚如磐石的东西
that think that you told me was rock solid

964
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,240
最后也不过狗屎一堆
was nothing more than a bucket of shit.

965
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,190
你想让我说什么
What do you want me to say?

966
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,000
我希望你说你会重新得到那份交易
I want you to say you'll get his deal back.

967
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,740
这我做不到  他们终止了交易
I can't do that. They pulled the plug.

968
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,490
真该死  是我逼他投向了你们
Goddamn it. I drove that guy to you.

969
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,640
你以为我不知道吗
Don't you think that I know that?

970
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,370
但如果我把事情告诉他们
But if I tell them that,

971
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,420
他们就会发现我们动过手脚
they're gonna know what we did.

972
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,380
那就不用菲利普・亚伦  放弃他
Then don't use Phillip Allen. Cut him loose,

973
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,700
让迈克帮你拿到需要的东西
and let Mike get you what you need.

974
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,760
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

975
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,310
就算我愿意这么做
Even if I wanted to do that,

976
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,040
他们也不会让这个主要证人离开的
they're not gonna let their star witness get away.

977
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,640
你是部门老大
You are the head of the department.

978
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,720
他们都会听你的
They will listen to you.

979
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,270
你告诉他们这个家伙就只会胡说八道
You tell them this guy turned out to be full of shit.

980
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,720
那我就换句话说
Then let me put it a different way.

981
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,370
我不会让我的主要证人就这么离开
I'm not letting my star witness get away

982
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,750
因为我不会让那个混蛋
'cause I'm not letting that bastard get away

983
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,790
坑了别人的辛苦钱然后逍遥法外
with bilking people out of their hard-earned money.

984
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,430
肖恩  求你了
Sean, please,

985
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,850
一定还有别的办法能达到目的
there's gotta be another way to make this happen.

986
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,070
抱歉  哈维  恐怕没有
I'm sorry, Harvey. There isn't.

987
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,670
那从我的眼前消失
Then get the hell out of my sight.
