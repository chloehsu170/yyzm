25
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,360
总而言之
Basically, 

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,320
有些人做事能力就是比其他人强
some people are just better at things than others.

27
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,330
编码就是这个道理
That's what coding makes you realize.

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,840
七就是七
The number seven is the number seven.

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,420
不是你说它是八
If you call it the number eight,

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,350
它就真的能变成八
you don't actually make it the number eight,

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,170
你只是在让自己难堪
you just embarrass yourself.

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,800
同样道理  男性在创造力上优于女性
Likewise, men are better at invention than women.

33
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,970
这是事实
Just a fact.

34
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,780
如今  这惹到了社交正义战士
Now, this makes SJWs upset.

35
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,380
他们觉得这个事实有些问题
They think there's something wrong with the fact

36
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,800
{\an8}社交正义战士：进步派的俚语表达

37
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,830
他们想改变这点
and they want to change it, 

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,960
但是谷歌一下
but go to a Google search

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,790
输入"女性发明"
and type in "She invents"

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,750
它会提示说"你是指男性发明吗"
and it'll ask, "Did you mean he invents?"

41
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,840
或者是说一年前才能搜索到
Or it did until a year ago.

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,430
你想知道为什么会有另类右翼吗
You want to know why there's an alt-right?

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,430
{\an8}反对主流政治  通过网媒故意散布有争议内容  持有极端保守或反对变革观点的意识形态组织

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,010
因为谷歌直接改了算法
Because Google just changed its algorithm

45
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,800
这样那些酷客才不会被男性发明而
so the cucks wouldn't be offended that men invent

46
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,830
{\an8}酷客：团结友爱的保守党  属于另类右翼用语

51
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,430
这也是我今天召集你们的原因
That's why I called you here today.

52
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,610
同时我也想看看
Oh, and also I wanted to see

53
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,720
我的新中西部律所是什么样的
what my new Midwest law firm looked like.

54
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,050
欢迎您大驾光临  格罗斯先生
We're glad to have you here, Mr. Gross.

55
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,150
谢谢  戴安
Thanks, Diane.

56
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,980
不像我那些有许多白人面孔的律所
Not quite as many white faces as at my other law firms.

57
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,690
我给大家带了份见面礼
Um, I have a little gift for you guys.

58
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,850
就是它
Here you go.

59
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,110
瞧
Voilà.

{\an8}雷迪克&博斯曼&科斯"塔"团队 「应为Kolstad」

61
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,080
把这些分给大家
Uh, pass those around both directions.

62
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,710
他把我名字写错了
He misspelled my name.

63
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,660
他一年能带来8600万收入
He's bringing in 86 million a year.

64
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,350
我会告诉他怎么写你的名字
I'll teach him how to spell your name.

65
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,970
以下是我的诉求
Here is what I need.

66
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,740
服务条款
A term of service.

67
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,820
我有两个网站快变成
I have two sites that have become like 

68
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,810
种族主义和性别歧视横行的"西大荒"
the Wild West of racism and sexism.

69
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,810
{\an8}指尚无法制的美国西部

70
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,950
我的社群网站服务「查查交友」和「瞎掰网」
My Facebook-like service Chummy Friends and, uh, Scabbit.

71
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,490
这有一个例子
And here's a sample from that.

72
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,000
"太棒了..."
"Great..."

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,520
黑人历史月到了
it's Black History Month.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,520
{\an8}赞颂黑人在美国历史发展中所扮演的重要角色

75
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,840
让这些"门前猴"更有借口
Gives all those porch monkeys an excuse

76
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,840
{\an8}对非洲人及非裔美国人的贬低之意

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,980
比平常大吵大闹
to be more annoying than usual.

78
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,460
我知道这里有些让你们倍感不适的言论
I'm sure you'll be disgusted by what you find in here,

79
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,050
这不仅影响恶劣
but it's not just bad,

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,140
同时也有损我的生意
it's also hurting my business.

81
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,730
在线广告避而远之
It scares off online advertising.

82
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,560
所以  为了删除这些特定的信息
So, you want us to come up with a code

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,000
你想让我们制定一项条款
in order to delete certain posts?

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,520
没错  而且这些用户应该被封号
Yes, and which users should be banned.

85
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,630
听我说  戴安
Now, look, Diane,

86
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,630
不用担心美国公民自由联盟那边
this is not something I have to worry about with the ACLU.

87
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,600
我有这些服务的所有权
I own these services.

88
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,210
我觉得怎么合适怎么来
I can control them in any way I see fit.

89
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,320
我注意到他只关注戴安
I notice only eyes for Diane.

90
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,740
-没错  -我们得找她谈谈
- Mm-hmm. - We got to talk to her.

91
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,910
-确保他也是我们的当事人  -没错
- Make sure he's our client, too. - Mm.

92
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,950
现在有个坏消息摆在你们面前
And now here's the bad news for you.

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,950
迪士尼公司威胁要把它所有广告
Disney is threatening to pull

94
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,280
从我的网站上撤下来
all of its advertising from my sites,

95
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,560
所以今天下午五点我就要这个条款
so I need a TOS by 5:00 P.M. Today.

96
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,800
所以  应该没人要去厕所吧
So, I hope no one needs to use the bathroom.

97
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,980
还有一件事
You know what, one last thing.

98
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,980
我喜欢这所非裔美国人律所
I love that this firm is African-American.

99
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,710
我看着你们的脸...
I look at all your faces and...

100
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,760
我看到了希望
and I see hope.

101
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,950
那么  我们应该先分一下组
So, we should probably split up into groups.

102
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,730
别  先把信息分下类
No, let's divide up the posts.

103
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,520
好  每人拿一摞
Agreed. Everybody take a pile.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,970
种族歧视的信息放这里
Uh, let's have racist posts here,

105
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,200
反犹主义的帖子放这里  剩下恐吓的信息
anti-Semitic right here, and at the end up there

106
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,530
全都放那里
we'll have threatening posts.

107
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,170
我们得再分一类
Uh, we might need another pile.

108
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,080
什么
What?

109
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,960
"我想你..."
"I would love to see you...

110
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,210
死  不是因为你是女权主义者
dead. Not because you're a feminist,

111
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,460
而是因为你就是个大婊子
but because you're an enormous fucking bitch.

112
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,120
厌女主义的信息放这里
Misogynistic posts here. 

113
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,930
好了  开工吧
All righty. Let's get to it.

114
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,050
我的天
Oh, good God.

115
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,440
这个信息不堪入目...
This one is disgusting...

116
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,240
爸  我最近工作很忙  但是  我尽量吧
Dad, I've been working pretty hard lately, but, um, I'll try.

117
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:38,970
我得挂了
I have to go.

118
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,060
已经过去两周了
Well, it's just been two weeks.

119
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,860
我不知道还能保释多长时间
I don't know how long I'll be out on bail.

120
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,650
可问题是  我现在是一名律师
But the problem is, i'm an associate.

121
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,140
我自己也身不由己
I don't control my own fate.

122
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,970
今晚过来吧  我给你泡爱尔兰咖啡
Come by tonight. I'll make Irish coffees.

123
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,820
好  我去
Okay. I will.

124
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,600
我真得挂了  戴安在叫我
I really have to go now. Diane is calling me.

125
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,620
今晚见
See you tonight.

126
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,890
"而且还要把你剁了  然后做..." 
"...and chop you up, too, and do the s..."

127
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,970
等等  停一下  把整条信息再读一遍
Wait, stop. Read the whole thing again.

128
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,600
再读下那个
Read-Read that again.

129
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,630
好  "你真是个伪君子"
Okay. "You're such a hypocrite."

130
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,230
你把宝宝的器官剁了扔到垃圾箱
You chop up baby parts and drop them in dumpsters.

131
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,560
你怎么知道我们不会把你也剁了
Why don't you think we wouldn't chop you up, too,

132
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,690
如法炮制
and do the same?

133
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,850
这个事关政治  是与政见相关的信息
It's politics. It's a political point of view.

134
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,440
不  这是恐吓
No, it's a threat.

135
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,820
他暗示说他会剁了那个人
He suggests he'll chop up the respondent.

136
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,500
不  他是说为什么他不该把她剁了呢
No, he's saying why shouldn't he chop her up?

137
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,950
-他意在指出虚伪行为  -你在开玩笑吗
- He's pointing out the hypocrisy. - Seriously?

138
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,860
他显然是在恐吓
He clearly means it as intimidating.

139
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,330
这是两个人之间平等交流各自政见
It's the equivalent of me taking your political thinking

140
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,660
从而得出合乎逻辑的结论
to its logical conclusion.

141
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,260
如果你不把未出世的宝宝当人看
If you don't treat an unborn baby as human,

142
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,570
那我们为什么要把你当人看呢
then why don't we not treat you as human?

143
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,680
好吧  我们还是投票表决吧
Okay, why don't we vote on this?

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,980
什么  你是普通律师  而我是合伙人
Excuse me. You're an associate. I'm the partner. 

145
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,720
拜托  朱利叶斯
come on, Julius.

146
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,270
等等  我们折中一下
Okay, wait, wait. Let's compromise.

147
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,270
{\an8}没必要按质排辈
There's no reason to call rank.

148
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,950
卢卡  把政见的归一类
Lucca, start a political pile.

149
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,210
我们稍后再做决定
We'll-We'll decide on it later.

150
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,400
那我们该给这一条投个票吗
Then should we vote on this one?

151
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,590
这属于恐吓吗
Is this a threat? 

152
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,000
-"有一个..."  -思维实验
- "Here's a... - ...thought experiment.

153
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,720
如果「人类清除计划」成真  你打算强奸谁
If The Purge were real, who would you set out to rape?

154
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,720
{\an8}惊悚电影  讲述为减少人类数量  美国政府展开一个12小时内允许所有犯罪行为的计划

155
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,620
我的话  就选赞达亚
For me, it'd be Zendaya.

156
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,620
{\an8}美国女演员  代表作「蜘蛛侠」

157
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,590
恐吓  绝对是恐吓
Threat. Clearly a threat.

158
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,270
等等
Wait a second.

159
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,340
他没有真的恐吓说要强奸她
He didn't actually threaten to rape her.

160
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,810
在我看来他只是在谈论电影罢了
It seems to me he's talking about a movie.

161
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,130
你真的要为这个做辩解吗
Are you seriously defending this?

162
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,570
不  我没有为其做辩解
No, I'm not defending this.

163
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,830
我是站在法律角度来判别恐吓
I'm making a legal distinction between a threat,

164
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,080
现实恐吓  和粗鄙的厌女评论的区别
a real threat, and a crude, misogynistic comment.

165
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,550
你的意思是这个人得说出"我想强奸你"吗
You're saying the person has to say, "I want to rape you"?

166
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,890
这个人必须说出"我要强奸你"
The person has to say, "I am going to rape you."

167
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,510
否则是受到言论自由保护的
Everything else is protected speech.

168
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,890
所以如果有人写"我想"而不是"我要"
So, we can't do anything about it

169
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,740
我们就无能为力了吗
if the person writes, "I want to" Instead of "I'm going to."

170
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,580
事实上  我们是能有所作为的
Actually, we can do anything we want.

171
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,320
格罗斯先生有这些网站的所有权
Mr. Gross owns these sites.

172
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,300
他制定任何条款都是合法的
He can legally set whatever terms he wants.

173
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,040
没错  但这些条款必须讲求公平
Yes, but the terms have to be fair.

174
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,910
好吧  这有条信息
Okay, so, here we go. 

175
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,200
-"我想..."  -强奸你
- "I want to... - ...rape you.

176
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,390
我想去你家  然后强...
I want to come to your house and ra...

177
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,860
若不是身处这个时代  我要强奸到你血...
If this were another century, I could fuck you until you bl...

178
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,260
那些酷客可不会承认想强奸你
The cucks could never admit to wanting to rape you.

179
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,640
这些信息都是同一个人发的
These posts are all from the same person.

180
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,120
指向同一个人吗
Directed at the same person?

181
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,320
没错  十条关于强奸的信息
Yes. Ten posts about rape.

182
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,770
不该对那个人封号吗
So, shouldn't that person be banned?

183
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,190
这可不仅仅是恐吓
It's not just about threats.

184
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,800
这已经算频繁骚扰了
It's about continual harassment.

185
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,000
我们难道不是应该
Well, isn't the problem here

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,830
基于敏感性而不是内容本身
that we're thinking of censoring based on sensitivities

187
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,980
对这些信息进行审查吗
and not content?

188
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,180
那重要吗
Does that matter?

189
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,170
我认为重要
I think it does.

190
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,860
如果我一天被攻击50次呢
And if I'm attacked 50 times a day?

191
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,000
那我同情你
Then I sympathize with you,

192
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,490
但是我认为言论的好坏不应改由那些
but I don't think speech should be judged by those

193
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,130
认为自己最受伤害的人来评价
who feel the most harmed.

194
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,160
"我希望他们"  
"I'm hoping they

195
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,300
找到你的地址
find your address.

196
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,700
我希望他们割掉你的乳头  在血泊中强奸你
I hope they cut off your nipples and rape you in a pool of blood.

197
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,270
这是发送到我账户的50条信息之一
This is one of 50 posts sent to my account.

198
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,220
但那是关于你父母的丑闻的  对吗
Uh, but that's about your parents' scandal, right?

199
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,460
我猜是的
My guess is yes,

200
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,470
但是有时候他们忙着讨论强奸我
but sometimes they're so busy discussing my rape

201
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,720
使得他们  没时间陈述他们的理由
that they, uh, they don't have time to state their reasoning.

202
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,290
我认为我们应该就屏蔽
I think we should vote on banning users

203
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,390
不断发送骚扰信息的用户进行投票
who continually send harassing posts.

204
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,580
那么我们的问题来了
Here's the problem for us.

205
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,780
你理解不断是什么意思
You know what continual means,

206
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
我理解不断是什么意思
I know what continual means,

207
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,680
但是我们如何定义它
how do we define it?

208
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,950
会有人挑措辞的破绽玩文字游戏的
There are people out there who will quibble.

209
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,380
{\an8}是的  但格罗斯先生想让我们拿出一套制度
Yeah, but Mr. Gross wants us to come up with a code.

210
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,350
那是底线
That's the bottom line.

211
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,660
否则的话我们不过是整理文件而已
Otherwise, we're just filing papers.

212
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,460
喂  怎么了
Hey. What's up?

213
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,620
...今天见
...see you today.

214
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,270
什么  我听不清
What? I can't hear you.

215
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,540
今天午饭的时候我需要跟你见个面
I need to see you today at lunch.

216
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,270
你穿什么颜色的内裤呢
What color panties are you wearing?

217
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,770
我不知道  我是色盲
I don't know. I'm color blind.

218
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,740
辩诉交易会谈时我意识到
I was in a plea bargaining session when I realized

219
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,400
就因为我没滚床单
I sent someone to jail for 30 years

220
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,730
就害了一个人蹲30年大牢
because I hadn't gotten laid.

221
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,920
你想聊聊吗
You wanted to talk?

222
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,280
是的  我回头再找你说这事
Uh, y-yeah, i'll have to get back to you on that.

223
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,490
四小时之后
Four hours.

224
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,070
阁下  我就是不明白
Sir, I just don't understand

225
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,950
我们为什么要让嫌疑人保释
why we're undercutting our most important case 

226
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,540
而削弱我们最重要的案子
by letting the suspect out on bail.

227
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,830
你看这盒沙拉
Look at this salad.

228
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,390
真的有什么好沙拉吗
Are there any actually good salads?

229
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,300
中国鸡肉沙拉
Chinese chicken salad?

230
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,680
上面的腰果和橙子都挺好
I mean, the cashews and oranges are good,

231
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,420
其余的不过是普通沙拉而已
but the rest is just salad.

232
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,070
阁下  这次谈话的重点在于
Sir, as important as this conversation is,

233
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,840
伊利诺伊州最可憎的人保释出狱
the most hated man in Illinois is out on bail.

234
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,790
你为何如此纠结克里斯特瓦做什么事情呢
Why are you so concerned about what Kresteva is doing?

235
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,070
因为我认为他正在给更重要的案子搞破坏
Because I think he's hurting more important cases.

236
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,970
他是想在警察暴力执法的案子上
He's trying to save Illinois money

237
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,930
给伊利诺伊州省点钱
on these police brutality cases.

238
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,280
所以  如果他拿雷迪克&博斯曼做了典型
So, if he makes Reddick/Boseman an example,

239
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,880
就能吓跑其他20家律所
he scares off 20 other firms.

240
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,720
如果他必须让亨利·林德尔保释出狱
If he has to let this Henry Rindell guy out on bail

241
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,760
来证明他的正确  那就随便他
to make his case, so be it.

242
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,820
好的  阁下
Yes, sir.

243
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,860
等等
Wait.

244
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,550
我能做的是
This is what I can do.

245
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,320
你刚刚被提拔为那什么小组工作负责人
You've just been made oversight head of...

246
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,390
算了  职名的事过会儿再说
whatever, we'll figure out the title later.

247
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,470
我想让你监督雷迪克&博斯曼的案子
I want you to supervise the Reddick/Boseman cases.

248
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,310
-啥  为什么  -因为执着
- What? Why? - Because you're obsessed.

249
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,210
我在利用你的执着
I'm harnessing your obsession.

250
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,300
把他们的进展汇报给我
Report back to me on their progress.

251
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,680
我有否决权吗
Will I have veto power?

252
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,760
没有  有监督权
No. Oversight power.

253
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,500
那是什么
What is that?

254
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,670
那就好比一架没有炸弹的无人机
It's like a drone without bombs.

255
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,650
为什么每次我升职
Why is it that whenever I get a promotion,

256
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,700
都感觉像降职似的
I feel like I'm being demoted?

257
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,830
问得好
It's a good question.

258
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,520
找到答案的时候记得告诉我
Tell me when you find out the answer.

259
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,630
我们不能把每个提到"黑傀"的信息都屏蔽
Seriously, we can't ban every use of the N-word.

260
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,630
{\an8}对黑人的蔑称

261
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,550
你可以的  唯一的问题是怎么...
Yes, you can. The only question is how...

262
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,040
不  不  黛安  那样的话
Mm-mm. No, no, every rap lyric on the planet

263
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,600
这世界上所有的饶舌歌词就都没了
would go out the window, Diane.

264
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,620
那「哈克贝利·费恩历险记」呢
What about Huckleberry Finn?

265
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,210
{\an8}因频繁使用"黑傀"一词而引起争议的小说  新版书将"黑傀"全数用"奴隶"替换

266
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,590
可以  那就很不幸了
Yes, that would be unfortunate.

267
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,210
所有引用「哈克贝利·费恩历险记」的推文也没了
All those times Huckleberry Finn is quoted in tweets.

268
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,710
问题在于  有研究表明
Here's the problem. They did a study that showed

269
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,820
推特上半数的性别歧视的真凶是女人
50% of Twitter's misogyny was perpetrated by women.

270
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,200
因此  如果我们屏蔽了
So, if we're banning

271
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,390
性别歧视和种族歧视的信息
misogynistic posts and racist posts...

272
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,450
等等  我也读过那篇论文  那是假的
Uh, wait, I read that study. It was bogus.

273
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,980
我也看过  它好像把"荡妇"和"淫妇"
Yeah, I did, too. It's like they just counted

274
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,840
都算作女性歧视了
the words "Slut" And "Whore" as misogynistic.

275
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,170
是的  而且许多女性
Right, and a lot of the women

276
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,470
是把"荡妇"用在"荡妇羞耻"的语境内
used the word "Slut" as in "Slut-shaming."

277
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,470
{\an8}女性为自己的性行为或性欲感到羞耻或低人一等的行为

278
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,410
这也支持了我的论点
Which supports my contention.

279
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,980
我们需要在语言上持中立态度
We need to be language neutral.

280
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,430
是的  但你可不是这么说的
Yeah, but that's not what you said.

281
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,430
好的  我这就走
Yeah, I'm going.

282
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,380
那是谁啊
Who is that?

283
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,880
我好无聊
I'm bored.

284
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,690
教我点东西吧
Teach me something.

285
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,270
说正经的呢
Come on, seriously.

286
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,480
教教我怎么干你这行
Teach me how to do your job.

287
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,930
我也能当调查员
I could be an investigator.

288
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,770
那是什么  你为什么要那样弄照片
What's that? Why are you doing that to the photos?

289
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,710
测量子弹壳和尸体之间的距离
Measuring the distance between the shell casing and the body.

290
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,430
天啊  这张好恐怖
God, this one's grisly.

291
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,040
你亲眼见过尸体吗
Have you ever seen a dead body in person?

292
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,020
见过
Yes.

293
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,820
-多少具  -六具
- How many? - Six.

294
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,530
我见过12具
I've seen 12.

295
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,770
公交车上的自杀式炸弹
Suicide bomb on a bus.

296
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,790
我是刚刚事发就赶到现场的
I got to the scene just afterwards.

297
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,700
那样稀松平常真是奇怪
It's weird how normal it was.

298
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
-可能吧  -除了孩子
- Can be. - Except for the kid.

299
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,480
婴儿手推车里有个小宝宝
There was a baby in a stroller.

300
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,670
你想知道什么
Okay, what do you want to know?

301
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
-你是怎么当上调查员的  -考个证
- How do you become an investigator? - Get a license.

302
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,340
没有证就不能调查了吗
I can't investigate unless I have a license?

303
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,240
也可以  但是会被抓
Well, you can, but you'll get caught.

304
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,340
天啊  这个国家就是这样打击积极性的
God, that's what's killing initiative in this country.

305
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,530
干什么都得有个证
Everything needs a license.

306
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,770
但是你可以辅助有证的调查员
Well, you can always assist a licensed investigator.

307
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,130
比如你
Like you?

308
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,000
不  不  我说的不是这个意思
No, no, that's not what I'm saying.

309
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,250
-但是你说了  -没有
- But you said it. - No.

310
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,270
我是概括性地说...
I said, in the abstract...

311
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,580
麻烦找一下玛娅·林德尔
Um, Maia Rindell, please.

312
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,490
好  她在里面  稍等
Yeah, she's in there. Hang on.

313
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,160
他们是美国公民吗
Are they American citizens?

314
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,430
-什么事  -你爸给你打电话了吗
- What? - Has your dad called you?

315
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,180
怎么了
Why?

316
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,850
天啊  你看你
God, look at you. 

317
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,170
你恨我
You hate me.

318
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,740
是你想要毁了我爸
You're trying to destroy my dad.

319
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,090
-我应该怎样表现  -我没有毁掉亨利
- How should I look? - I'm not destroying Henry.

320
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,010
我只是不想让他毁了我
I'm just trying to keep him from destroying me.

321
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,220
还有你  我不是敌人
And you. I'm not the enemy here.

322
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,480
你提交了证据
You turned evidence.

323
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,260
因为你爸也这么做了
Because your dad was doing the same.

324
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,510
好了
Okay, good.

325
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,120
我们谈过了  我们了解彼此了
We talked. We understand each other.

326
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,260
-你该走了  -玛娅
- You should go. - Maia,

327
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,890
接下来的一两天  你爸给你打电话
your dad is gonna call you in the next day or two

328
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,350
找你跟他面谈
and ask you to meet him to talk.

329
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,870
只有你们俩
Just the two of you.

330
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,860
他会弄得很家常  喝点东西什么的
He'll try to make it sound casual... drinks or something.

331
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,370
如果他这么做了  要拒绝他
If he does that, say no.

332
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,140
-为什么  -他会佩戴窃听器
- Why? - He'll be wearing a wire.

333
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,930
他会引导你说出一些证明我有罪的话
He'll try to get you to say something incriminating

334
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,300
还有公司的事
about me, about this firm.

335
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,700
甚至可能是关于你自己的
Maybe even about yourself.

336
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,760
我为什么要相信你
Why do I trust you?

337
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,920
因为我是你叔叔  我站在你的这边
Because I'm your uncle, and I'm on your side.

338
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,320
我叔叔  跟我妈婚外情的叔叔
My uncle, who is sleeping with my mom.

339
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,090
丽诺是这么说的吗
Is that what Lenore said?

340
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,820
我撞见你们两个了
I walked in on you two.

341
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,770
我得回去工作了
I've got to get back to work.

342
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,960
拒绝他  玛娅
Say no, Maia.

343
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,000
如果你爸打电话跟你谈
If your dad calls to talk to you,

344
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,290
跟他说你们不能见面
tell him you can't meet.

345
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,420
准备好了吗
Yeah, ready?

346
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,530
等下
Hold on. Whoa, whoa.

347
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,340
喂
Hello?

348
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,940
爸...  我...
Dad, uh... I've...

349
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,720
今晚不行了  抱歉
I can't do tonight, sorry.

350
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,160
怎么了
Oh. Why not?

351
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,570
工作
Work.

352
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,770
不然我去找你吧
Well, then, maybe I'll come to you.

353
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,670
不  不了  今晚不行
No, no, not tonight.

354
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,610
我看看过几天晚上行不行
Let me see if I can arrange another night.

355
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,330
玛娅  拜托了  我们要谈谈
Maia, please, we need to talk.

356
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,730
电话里讲吧
Tell me on the phone.

357
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,740
不好  还是当面说比较好
No, it's better if we do it in person.

358
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,930
明晚吧
Tomorrow night.

359
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,500
我看看能不能行
Let me see what I can do.

360
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,930
爱你
Love you.

361
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,910
{\an8}埃尔斯贝特·塔肖尼

362
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,470
你知道我们的顾虑
You know what the worry is.

363
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,330
我们制定的规则会被用于政治目的
Our rules are gonna be used for political ends.

364
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,430
我们只是单纯地被要求创造出一种民主的氛围
We have simply been asked to create a civil atmosphere...

365
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,630
不是这样  他们要求我们制定合理的规则
No, we've been asked to create fair rules

366
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,700
来赶走这些人
for expelling members.

367
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,510
如果这些人都是保守派的...
If all of those members are conservative...

368
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,620
-他们不全是保守派的  -他们就是
- They aren't all conservative. - Yes, they are.

369
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,480
我们经手的每个案例都是关于
Every example we've used is about

370
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,630
激进的反堕胎人士在威胁
passionate pro-lifers intimidating

371
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,780
可怜的  无助的同意堕胎合法的人
poor, helpless little pro-choicers.

372
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,300
那是因为威胁来自于右翼
That's because the intimidation is coming from the right.

373
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,430
但是审查机制的人是站在左翼的
Well, the censorship is coming from the left!

374
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,160
{\an8}科林·莫雷洛
去他的工作  现在过来见我

375
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,970
不  但我有个...  我能不能...
No, but I have a... could I...

376
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,700
大伙  大伙  能听我说两句吗
Guys? Guys. Could I please say something?

377
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,930
最关键的问题是得看语境  对吗
Okay, the problem here is and always will be contexted, right?

378
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,630
我们没法制定出一个一劳永逸的规则
I mean, we can't create one-size-fits-all rules,

379
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,530
所以我们只需要一个上诉机制
so what we need is an appeal process.

380
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,490
继续讲
Keep going.

381
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,210
比如说有一个人骚扰超过了13次
Well, say someone harasses more than 13 times,

382
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,050
或是威胁他人超过两次
or threatens more than twice.

383
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,820
那他们的作品就只能经过审查后
They are kept from posting any more until a panel

384
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,320
才能发布
reviews their work.

385
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,340
我们会给这个用户一个机会
Then the person is given the chance

386
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,130
为他  或者她申辩
to defend him or herself.

387
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,600
大家同意这个观点吗
Can we agree on that?

388
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,540
朱利叶斯
Julius?

389
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,970
-同意  -很好
- Yes. - Good.

390
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,020
那我们现在就只用考虑上诉机制了
So we just kicked our problem down the road to an appeal process.

391
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,360
这不是很好吗
Doesn't it feel good?

392
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,330
{\an9}*Work for that money get that money for the work*

393
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,860
{\an9}*Then I spit the hottest verse*

394
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,720
{\an9}*When I'm flying around the Earth*

395
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,040
{\an8}-你们这些另类右翼真可耻
-问题在你们身上  朋友  你们没有安全感  无法面对现实不能赖在另类右翼的人身上

396
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,300
{\an9}*Cash in hand I'll turn a penny to a grand*

397
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,170
{\an8}提交

398
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,650
{\an9}*When I'm ready, I'm-a land rockin' steady for my fans*

399
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,290
{\an9}*Never hesitant 'bout these dead presidents*

400
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,220
{\an8}你暂时不能发布消息  需要上诉  请点击下方链接

401
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,590
{\an9}*Tuck my Benjamins, yeah I'll be NNM...*

402
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,510
挺有意思
This is gonna be fun. 

403
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,200
{\an9}*Do another show...*

404
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,780
进来吧  请坐
So come on in. Um, have a seat.

405
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,090
抱歉  他们还没有把我的家具送来
Sorry, they still haven't delivered my furniture.

406
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,220
没关系
Oh, well, that's okay.

407
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,110
感觉这里还差点烧烤和帅哥
Feels like we should have barbecue and Franks here.

408
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,190
我爸打电话给我了...
My dad called. Um...

409
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,080
他想和我单独会面  没有律师在场
he wanted to meet, alone, without a lawyer.

410
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,870
好吧  这并不能说明什么
Okay, well, that's not necessarily anything.

411
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,570
我叔叔贾克斯  他警告我我爸会佩戴窃听器
My Uncle Jax, he warned me that my dad would wear a wire.

412
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,890
你能不能  把桌子上的
Could you, um, reach up there

413
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,820
笔记本拿给我
and hand me that pad there?

414
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,560
这是刚刚发生的事吗
Oh, so, this just happened?

415
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,280
是的  是的  今天的事
Uh, yeah, yeah, today.

416
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,900
我爸  他想今晚和我见面
My dad, he wanted to meet tonight,

417
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,260
-但我推掉了  -好姑娘
- but I said I couldn't. - Good girl.

418
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,630
播放好姑娘的「好人」
Playing "Goodie," By Good Girl.

419
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,140
不  停
No. Stop.

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,600
艾达  停
Ada, stop.

421
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,910
抱歉  这是范塔西娅给我的
Sorry, it's this thing Fantasia got me.

422
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,470
艾达  停止播放
Ada, stop playing!

423
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,790
加大音量
Volume up.

424
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,700
继续  它会自己停的
Go ahead, it wears itself out.

425
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,520
我该怎么做
What should I do?

426
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,930
我知道我希望你怎么做
I know what I want you to do,

427
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,700
-但也许你不想这么做  -什么
- but you may not want to. - What?

428
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,210
我说我知道我希望你怎么做
Uh, I said I know what I want you to do.

429
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,770
不不  这句我听见了...
No, no, no, I heard that. Um...

430
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
你希望我怎么做
What do you want me to do?

431
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,320
给他提供假消息
Feed him false information.

432
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,550
你认识特拉维斯·利奥波德吗
Do you know who Travis Leopold is?

433
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,870
-不认识  -他是一名房地产大亨
- No. - He's a real estate magnate

434
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,320
给了你们律所800万
with $8 million in business at your law firm.

435
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,660
-我从没听说过他  -因为是我刚编的
- I never heard of him. - Because I just made him up.

436
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,110
要是你爸问起你的工作  装作很忧虑的样子
If your dad asks about your business, act worried.

437
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,740
他会问你忧虑什么
He'll ask you why you're worried.

438
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,810
你就告诉他你不能说
You tell him you can't talk about it.

439
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,090
如果他没问了  他就没有戴窃听器
If he lets it go, he's not wearing a wire.

440
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,960
但如果他追问下去
But if he pushes you,

441
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,170
你就告诉他阿德里安·博斯曼为利奥波德先生
tell him Adrian Boseman backdated earnings

442
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,470
倒填了收益日期  帮他逃税
for Mr. Leopold to help him with his taxes.

443
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,430
利奥波德先生就给了你们律所
And Mr. Leopold gifted your firm

444
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,940
80万作为回报
with a bonus of $800,000.

445
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,670
我做不到
I can't do that.

446
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,500
是  是
Yeah, yeah.

447
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,470
我就说了你可能不愿意这么做
That's why I said you might not want to do it.

448
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,890
还有一个方法就是别去见你爸
I mean, the other option is don't see your dad.

449
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,740
好吧...
Okay, um...

450
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,980
-起来吧  -谢谢
- Oh. Here we go. - Thank you.

451
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,660
但如果你要这么做  记得录音
Oh, uh, but if you do do it, record it.

452
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,650
就把手机打开  然后...
Just turn on your iPhone and, uh...

453
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,250
点一下"录音"键
...hit "Record."

454
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,770
你明晚想跟我一起吃晚饭吗
Wanna have dinner with me tomorrow night?

455
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,390
晚饭...

457
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,680
你得说说有什么不同
You'll have to explain the difference.

458
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,580
晚饭就是上床
Dinner is fucking.

459
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,830
正式晚饭就是约会  然后再上床
Dinner dinner is a date, then fucking.

460
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,870
好吧  是正式晚饭
Mm, okay. Dinner dinner.

461
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,320

我们是来听你的上诉的

很好  介意我站着吗
Great. Mind if I stand?

472
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,420
我...  请便
I... Please do.

473
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,500
你上次大选投给谁了

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,600
-什么  -总统大选你投给谁了

475
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,120
-我不便回答你的问题  -为什么
- I'm not gonna answer that. - Why not?

476
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,180
这与上诉无关
It's irrelevant.

477
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,570
是吗  你们的政治倾向与这次上诉无关
Really? Your politics are irrelevant to this?

478

那我呢
What about me?

- How much money did I give to Trump? - I don't know.

489
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,530
我没有查你的捐款
I didn't check your contribution

490
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,280
因为这不能论证我要陈述的事实
'cause it doesn't fit my narrative.

491
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,770
7500美元

492

很好  你的故事是你的
Great. Write your own narrative.

493
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,640
我要说的是我是你们政治正确下的
Mine is that I'm a martyr

494
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,630
殉难者
to your political correctness.

495
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,160
-也许不是你的  -我赢了
- Maybe not yours. - I win.

496
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,190
我想你会在前五分钟
I guessed you would say "Political correctness"

497
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,170
提到"政治正确"
within the first five minutes.

498
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,870
真"有意思"
Well, that was almost funny.

499
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,700
你们现在处境不佳  没必要卖弄幽默
You know, you're in an unfortunate position to be funny 

500
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,910
因为你们都是汤姆·布勒和凯蒂·布勒
because you're all Tom and Katie Buellers.

501
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,440
汤姆·布勒是谁

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,940
大家都喜欢我
Everybody likes me.

506
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,180
对不  有趣的家伙  什么都不在乎的家伙
Right? The funny guy. The guy who doesn't care.

507
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,510
了解了  斯塔普斯先生
Good to know, Mr. Staples.

508
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,770
这就是你的申诉吗  你很有趣
Is that your appeal, that you're funny?

509
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,450
一部分是这样  但首先我想知道
In part, but first I'd like

510
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,680
你们为什么封禁我的账号
to know why you banned me.

511
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,600
我们先从你的反犹太人言论开始吧
Well, let's start with your anti-Semitic posting.

512
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,300
好啊  开始吧
Okay, let's do it.

513
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,140
"我读到你的留言"
"When I read your posts..."

514
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,860
有时候我觉得我们需要进行一次外科手术式屠杀
...sometimes I think we need a surgical holocaust.

515
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,080
把讨厌的犹太人都干掉
Just kill the irritating Jews.

516
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,040
怎么了
Yes?

517
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,640
这是你的申诉  不是我们的
It's your appeal, not ours.

518
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,230
我本人就是犹太人  行过割礼了
Well, I'm Jewish, circumcised.

519
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,060
我可以现在就掏出来给你们看
I can show you right now.

520
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,950
我当时是在和另一位批评内塔尼亚胡
Uh, I was arguing with another Jew who criticized Netanyahu

521
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,950
{\an8}内塔尼亚胡：以色列总理

522
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,490
并想把笑脸贴纸贴到
and wanted to paste happy face stickers

523
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,380
所有巴基斯坦人脸上的犹太人争论
on all the Palestinian faces.

524
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,900
所以我脱口而出了这句会伤害到他的话
So I said what I knew would hurt him.

525
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,200
你是想说
Are you arguing that

526
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,440
犹太人就不可能反犹了吗
someone who's Jewish can't be anti-Semitic?

527
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,090
不
No.

528
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,100
我想说的是我的评论是政治言论
I'm arguing my post was political

529
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,320
而不是反犹太人言论
and not anti-Semitic.

530
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,720
对吗  我本可以这么写
Right? I-I could've written

531
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,810
"恕我直言  先生  我不同意你的观点"
"With all due respect, sir, I disagree with you."

532
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,230
当然可以这么说  但那就伤不到他了
Sure, but that wouldn't have hurt him.

533
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,090
-而我想伤到他  -造成身体上的伤害吗
- And I wanted to hurt him. - Physically?

534
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,930
不  我想让他哭
No, I wanted to make him to cry.

535
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,690
我想让他因为他那些被反犹分子屠杀的
I want to make him cry for his poor dead ancestors slaughtered

536
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,850
已故先人而哭
by anti-Semites. 

537
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,230
我明白你想在这里把自己粉饰成受害者
I understand you want to make yourself the victim here,

538
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,920
斯塔普斯先生  但实际上你是
Mr. Staples, but you are

539
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,120
一位另类右翼势力领导者
a leader of the alt-right.

540
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,190
另类右翼都讨厌同性恋  不是吗
The alt-right, ma'am, hates gays, don't they?

541
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,550
-大多数是这样  -他们讨厌同性恋婚姻
- Well, for the most part. - They hate gay marriage,

542
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,360
他们信教  他们是保守主义者
they're religious, they're conservative,

543
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,680
而我
and yet, I... do...

544
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,370
戴米恩
Damian?

545
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,660
我并不想这样的
I didn't want to have to...

546
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,560
戴米恩是我花50美元叫来的同性恋男妓
Damian is a gay prostitute 

547
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,730
-他可以当场给我口交  -好了  够了
- whom I paid $50 to blow me right now. - Okay. All right.

548
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,920
这买卖太划算了实在不能错过
Too good of a deal to pass up.

549
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,020
跟你们说了我是犹太人
Told you I was Jewish.

550
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,190
好了  好了  我们明白你的意思了
All right, all right, you made your point.

551
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,470
现在这里谁是保守主义者
Who's the conservative?

552
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,300
谁又是恐同者  先生
Who's the homophobe, sir?

553
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,470
反正不是我
Not me.

554
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,070
如果可能的话  我立刻就可以
Look, I would... I'd be a heterosexual in a second,

555
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,120
变成一位异性恋
if I could be,

556
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,530
但我愿意当着你们的面
but I'm willing to be fellated

557
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,880
被人吹箫
in front of this panel

558
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,060
因为我相信美国  戴米恩  开吹
because I believe in America. Damien!

559
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,880
好了
Okay. 

560
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,870
-*我的双眼已经看到了*  -好了  够了
- *Mine eyes have seen the glory* - All right. Okay.

561
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,910
-*主将要降临的荣耀*  -好了
- *Of the coming of the Lord* - Yeah.

562
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,060
*他踏过*
*He has trampled ev...*

563
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,570
上帝啊  真是个极品
God, talk about a piece of work.

564
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,480
他在博宣传  他这是在试图挑衅我们
He's looking for publicity, he's trying to provoke us.

565
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,710
所以  我们不上他的套
So, we don't engage.

566
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,400
我们就仅仅咬住他写的信息
We stick to his posts.

567
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,720
如果我们以政治作为论点  我们就输了
See, if we debate politics, we lose.

568
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,290
{\an8}扎克·迪瓦恩
晚上喝两杯听起来不错  把地方告诉我

569
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,270
他想把脏水引到我们身上  你看
He's trying to make it about us, you see.

570
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,500
你想要怎样
What do you need?

571
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,920
我知道明天还有一次申诉听证会
Uh, I know we have another session tomorrow,

572
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,110
我只是  我向先提前道个歉
but I just... I want to apologize ahead of time.

573
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,100
道歉什么
For?

574
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,410
网上的人
People on the interwebs

575
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,520
或许会说些你们的坏话
might have nasty things to say about you guys,

576
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,520
我只是想让你知道  我与此无关
I just want you to know, I have nothing to do with it.

577
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,490
知道了
Good to know.

578
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,290
你让我想起了我妈妈
You remind me of my mom.

579
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,710
她是位老师
She was a school teacher.

580
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,320
她教我要去爱我的同胞
And she taught me to love my fellow man,

581
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,500
如果我们都去拥抱我们的敌人
and if we all just hug our enemies,

582
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,400
就会迎来千年的和平
peace would last 1,000 years.

583
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,800
所以你现在这样是叛逆吗
So this is rebellion?

584
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
不  只是博人一笑
No, this is having a laugh.

585
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,750
你笑得太少了  洛哈特女士
You don't smile enough, Mrs. Lockhart.

586
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,610
你应该在生活中多找点乐子
You need to get more joy out of life.

587
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,950
拜拜  老妈
Bye, Mom.

588
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,920
-梅丽莎  -在
- Marissa? - Yeah.

589
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,140
在查查网上找找
Check the Chummy sites

590
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,540
有没有关于我们或者律所的新留言
for any new comments on our firm, or on us.

591
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,810
行  我们要找什么样的留言
Sure. What are we looking for? 

592
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,440
-威胁  骚扰言论  -没问题
- Threats. Harassment. - No problem.

593
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,510
戴安
Oh, Diane?

594
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,030
你指的是不是
You mean like, 

595
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,520
"如果你强奸一位女律师"
"Is it considered rape..."

596
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,920
这算不算强奸呢
...if you rape a female lawyer?

597
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,420
告诉我  洛哈特女士
Tell me, Ms. Lockhart,

598
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,860
如果我强奸了一位女律师  你能帮我脱罪吗
could you get me off if I raped a female lawyer?

599
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,040
这还有一条
And here's another.

600
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,420
还有两条
Ugh, and two more.

601
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,980
你想让我把这些留言转发给你吗

{\an8}留言因涉及不当言论而被移除

608
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,720
他们知道把不当言论控制在13条以下
They know to keep it under 13 posts.

609
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,150
-什么  -那些另类右翼

610

他们一直在给我们发骚扰留言

而每个人都只发了12条

The rules were discussed in private session.

616
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,130
-杰  -我尽力去查查看

but these alt-right guys,

618
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,090
我猜他们是不会愿意和我交谈的
my guess is they're not gonna want to talk to me.

619
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,060
你在做什么

625
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,080

我正在控制饮食排毒
I'm on this detox.

627
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,120
如果你吃了八根薯条

00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,230
那就是摄入了142卡路里

我不知道

你爸之前心情有点低落

于是临时给他弄了一场派对

应该找机会再一起去波拉波拉岛
Bora Bora, we need to go back.

673
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,240

我永远搞不清楚界限在哪里  你明白吗

合法或不合法的界限

701
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,480
可能只是  我不知道  作为父亲关心而已

713

714
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,950

00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,580
我有点赶时间
Look, I don't have a lot of time.

如果你看到他  告诉他梅丽莎来过
If you see him, tell him Marissa dropped by,

722
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,460
还有我非常喜欢他那条"七不等于八"的信息
and I love his "Seven doesn't equal eight" post.

723
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,890
不好意思
Uh, s-sorry,

724
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,420
我最近得到太多莫名其妙的关注了
I just get a lot of unwanted attention.

菲利克斯让我来联系你
Felix told me to get in touch with you.

他想先暂时不管四叶论坛

不对  这应该由审查小组制定
No, this is from the censorship panel.

00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,700
-戴安  -真是太完美了
- Diane. - How fitting.

756
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,200
洛哈特小姐和我关系很好的  不是吗
Uh, Ms. Lockhart and I have a certain rapport, don't we?

757
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,660
斯塔普斯先生  请解释一下有关
Mr. Staples, please explain your posts

758
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,640
堕胎合法化激进分子  迪莱拉·米斯的信息
regarding the pro-choice activist Dahlila Mills.

759
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,600
迪莱拉·米斯  迪莱拉·米斯
Dahlila Mills. Dahlila Mills.

760
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,790
迪莱拉·米斯
Dahlila Mills...

761
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,460
是个好名字  可我就是想不起来了
Beautiful name. I... can't place it.

762
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,210
是的  我暴怒的时期
Ah! Yes. My days of rage.

763
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,520
我们来尽点自己的本分吧
Let's all do our part.

764
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,750
消灭迪莱拉·米斯的基金  有人想捐款吗
Who wants to contribute to a fund to take out Dahlila Mills?

765
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,280
告诉我  斯塔普斯先生
Tell me, Mr. Staples,

766
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,960
这为什么不是一个可以起诉的恐吓呢
why is that not an actionable threat?

767
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,210
因为我没有在恐吓她啊
Because I'm not threatening her.

768
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,590
我说"消灭她"  并不是"杀了她"的意思
I don't mean "Take her out" as in "Kill her."

769
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,110
我的老天爷  你把我当什么禽兽了
My goodness, what kind of monster do you think I am?

770
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,240
我只是说
I'm talking about

771
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,660
不要让她在出现在辩论中
taking her out of the debate.

772
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,040
那你如何让某人不再出现在辩论中呢
And how do you take someone out of a debate?

773
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,420
不知道啊  痛骂她  让她难堪
I don't know. Shout her down, embarrass her.

774
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,640
你为什么会需要这样的基金呢
Why do you need funds for that?

775
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,410
那你又为什么需要基金来买裙子呢
Why do you need funds for that dress?

776
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,810
因为我不想沦落到穿你那衣服的地步
Because I don't want to end up in that jacket.

777
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,480
咱们法庭上可有的吵了
Oh! I will see you in court.

778
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,590
再问一次  你为什么需要基金来阻止某人
Again, why do you need funds to shut someone down?

779
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,790
我想不到有趣的答案  所以我拒绝回答
I can't think of anything funny, so I decline to reply.

780
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,010
当你写完那个之后
Well, after you wrote that,

781
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,080
米斯女士收到了这些信息
these posts were sent to Ms. Mills.

782
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,230
-"我们会来抓到你的"  -记得锁好门
- "We're coming to get you, be..." - ...sure to lock your doors,

783
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,950
因为宪法第二修正案就是为你这种人设立的
'cause the Second Amendment was made for people like you.

784
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,950
{\an8}宪法第二修正案：人民持有及携带武器的权利

785
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,930
你知道近距离用格洛克手枪打哈密瓜会什么样吗
You ever see what a Glock does to cantaloupe close up?

786
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,840
事后打扫你的浴室太麻烦了
It's hard to clean up in your shower.

787
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,350
最简单的方法就是恶意人肉搜索
The easiest thing is to just dox you.

788
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,690
{\an8}恶意人肉搜索：在网上恶意公布某人的私人信息

789
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,510
明天用下信用卡吧
Try using your credit card tomorrow.

790
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,840
看看会发生什么
See what happens.

791
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,690
贱人  贱人  烂货  贱人
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, double-cunt, bitch...

792
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,870
"贱人  贱人"
"...bitch, bitch."

793
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,440
听起来火气可真不小
Wow, they all sound angry.

794
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,070
这些人和正在网上攻击我们的是同一批人
These are the same accounts now harassing us,

795
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,590
因为是你让他们这么做的
because you told them to.

796
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,910
瞧你说的  好像我对这些人有秘密的操控能力
You act like I have some secret control over people.

797
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,470
不  不是什么秘密
No, not secret.

798
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,270
你有证据支持你的观点吗
Do you have some proof to back up this contention?

799
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,940
当然
Yes.

800
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,450
一位叫艾伦·福勒的人声称  你直接告诉他
An Aaron Fowler claimed you directly told him

801
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,750
让他将骚扰我们的信息数量控制在13以下
to keep his harassment of this panel to under 13 posts.

802
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,310
其实  唯一比汤姆和凯蒂·布勒更悲哀的是
Do you know, the only thing sadder than Tom and Katie Bueller

803
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,100
费力·布勒在满口谎话时被揭穿
is a sputtering Ferris Bueller caught in a lie.

804
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,110
老天  你简直和我妈一模一样
God, you are exactly like my mom.

805
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,190
-我能给你读几条信息吗  -请
- Can I read you a few posts? - Please.

806
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,730
我们希望尽最大可能给你机会来为自己辩护
We want to give you every opportunity to defend yourself.

807
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,330
这是一位堕胎合法化激进分子发给我的
This is to me from a pro-choice activist.

808
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,790
去死吧  我希望你在给南方乡巴佬
"Go to..." ...hell. I hope you choke on the cocks

809
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,650
吹箫的时候噎死
of the southern rednecks you're blowing.

810
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,820
这明显还是一个种族歧视的激进分子
Now this is clearly a racist pro-choice activist,

811
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,340
因为我们都知道那里应该是黑色的
because it's well known the cocks in question are black.

812
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,210
不信的话  你可以查一下我的交友信息
You can check my dating profile.

813
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,260
后面还有呢
There's more.

814
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,630
-"他们首先会来"  -反对我堕胎的权利
- "First they'll come..." - ...for my abortion rights,

815
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,420
接着就是你们的基佬婚姻  你这自怨自艾的犹太佬  
then they'll come for your gay marriage, you self-hating kike.

816
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,250
"犹太佬」  后面还有其他的
"Kike." And there are more.

817
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,380
如你所见  我很好奇为什么我会成为目标
So you can see, I'm wondering why I'm being targeted

818
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:37,090
因为反正堕胎合法化阵营也是一样丑恶
when the pro-choice side is just as ugly.

819
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:40,420
如果能跟你们一样程度  我们会关注的
If its ugliness matches yours, it will be addressed.

820
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,380
我们并没有针对某一方的意思
We're not targeting any one side.

821
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,170
但是  从你们的商议记录来看
And yet, in your transcripts from your deliberations...

822
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,320
先等等  等一
Wait a second, wait a...

823
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,660
-你有我们的记录副本  -我想是的
- You have our transcripts? - I believe I do.

824
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,820
你知道那是版权信息吗
And you know that's proprietary information?

825
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,930
这上面没有相关声明
It doesn't say so.

826
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,630
查查网可以就此事起诉你
Chumhum could sue you for that.

827
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,250
不  他们可以起诉泄露信息的人
No, they could sue the person who leaked it.

828
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,790
我只是个想向社会
I'm just the citizen-journalist

829
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,110
传达信息的公民记者
wanting to communicate it to the world.

830
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,330
无论如何  在之前的讨论中
Anyway, in this earlier discussion, 

831
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:07,870
科斯达女士  你用非常不雅的言词
Ms. Kolstad, you shouted down Julius Cain

832
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,700
大声喝止朱利叶斯·凯恩的发言
in language most indecorous.

833
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,350
我认为你将"汤姆叔叔"用作了动词[卑躬屈膝]
I believe you used the word "Uncle Tom" as a verb.

834
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,790
他真是个混蛋
He's a fucking asshole.

835
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,700
他试图让别人觉得我们很虚伪
And he's trying to make us look hypocritical.

836
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,900
他是个卑鄙的混账种族主义者
He's a racist little motherfucker.

837
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,120
那我们要怎么做
So what do we do?

838
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,860
等一下  这是怎么回事
Wait a minute. What is it?

839
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,780
我的天呐
Oh, my God.

840
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,800
我们律所什么时候变成马戏团了
When did this law firm become a circus?

841
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,480
戴安  你现在有空吗
Diane. Do you have a second?

842
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,610
斯塔普斯先生  如果你想说什么
If you have something to say, Mr. Staples,

843
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,910
就在委员会全体成员面前说  不要只对我说
say it in front of the whole committee, not just me.

844
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,750
-但我不喜欢他们  -因为你是种族主义者
- But I don't like them. - Because you're racist.

845
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,600
不是
No.

846
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,600
是  我对整个黑人群体都没有好感
And yes, I don't like blacks as a group.

847
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,490
不过这偏题了
But that's beside the point.

848
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,780
你想没想过尼尔·格罗斯为什么会选这家律所
Have you ever wondered why Neil Gross chose this firm

849
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,250
来主管他的服务条款审查委员会
to be in charge of his TOS committee?

850
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,260
你显然是想向我透露什么  那就说吧
You obviously want to tell me something, so tell me.

851
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,720
让一个黑人组成的律所
Putting an all-black law firm

852
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,740
负责他的审查委员会
in charge of his censorship committee?

853
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,310
你觉得这说得通吗
Does that make sense to you?

854
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,910
再见  斯塔普特先生
Good-bye, Mr. Staples.

855
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,760
再见  戴安·洛哈特
Good-bye, Diane Lockhart.

856
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,050
我承诺过要向你们做案件进度报告的
I promised to give you a progress report on your case.

857
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,160
所以我来啦
So, hi, here I am.

858
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,950
我向亨利·林德尔泄露了一个假消息
Anyway, I leaked a fictitious story to Henry Rindell

859
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:47,270
说贵所从一个虚构的客户那里接受了
about your firm receiving an $800,000 bribe

860
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,520
80万贿赂
from a fictitious client

861
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,340
来倒填其收入的日期
to backdate his earnings.

862
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,800
-什么  -是的  我知道
- Uh, w-what? - Yeah, I know.

863
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,910
不过我们可以利用这事来整克里斯特瓦
But we can use this to embarrass Kresteva.

864
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,960
塔肖尼女士  抱歉  我想得可能太简单了
Ms. Tascioni, I'm sorry to be prosaic in my thinking,

865
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,750
但这也不太像复杂情况
but this doesn't seem like a baroque matter.

866
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,220
我们没有做错任何事
We didn't do anything wrong.

867
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,720
你为什么要误导调查员呢
Why are you misleading the investigator?

868
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,660
好问题
Good question.

869
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,740
如果这个调查员是诚实的
And if this investigator were honest,

870
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,150
我会觉得你是对的
I would say you were right.

871
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,640
不过  虽然我不想如此评价任何人
But... and I hate to say this about any person...

872
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,400
迈克·克里斯特瓦习惯说谎
Mike Kresteva tends to lie.

873
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,230
那你需要我们做什么呢
So what do you need from us?

874
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,650
如果你们从别人那里听说了这80万美元贿金
If you hear about this $800,000 gift from anyone,

875
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,440
就意味着亨利·林德尔在跟我们作对
that means Henry Rindell is working against us,

876
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,400
而且我们也许能利用这一点
and we might be able to use it.

877
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,130
{\an8}新装修公寓开放参观日

878
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,900
我要做什么
So what do I do?

表现得年轻甜蜜一点
Act young and sweet.

880
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,280
我们要扮演什么人
Who are we?

881

任何人都可以
Anyone we want.

882
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,870
天呐  我喜欢这个工作
God, I love this job.

883
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,620
我需要一副眼镜  我想扮一个地质学家
I need glasses. I want to be a geologist.

884
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,380
不行  这不是动画片
No, this isn't a cartoon.

885
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,720
好吧  你是个产品分析师
All right? You're a product analyst.

886
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,070
没人会问产品分析师是什么
No one asks what that is.

887
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,050
需要为你们介绍一下吗
Do you want a setup?

888
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,180
-当然  -你好  我们想在卢普区
- Sure. - Hi, we're just in the market

889
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,520
找个两居室
for a two bedroom in the Loop,

890
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,040
我们看到这里就停下进来看看  对吧  杰
so we saw this and we skidded to a stop, didn't we, Jay?

891
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,700
他不喜欢我这样喋喋不休地说话
Oh, God, he hates when I rattle on like that.

892
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,620
但是我们很爱对方  我还有什么好说的呢
But we love each other, so what can I say?

893
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,600
年轻人的爱情  有感染力
Young love. It's infectious.

894
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,610
对吧  像瘟疫一样
Isn't it? Like the plague.

895
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,210
这里作为年轻情侣的第一间公寓是很不错的
Well, this is a very good starter apartment for young couples.

我们之间的关系
that our relationship was, well,

986
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,770
并不是情侣关系

你担心我们之间的进展太过认真
You're worried that we're getting too serious,

991

所以就拒绝与我约会  转而邀请你的小白脸
so you turn down a date with me, and then you invite your boy toy

992

去一个我可能会见到他的地方
to a place where I might see him,

993

问题是  你现在来跟我争论
Problem is, now you're here, arguing with me,

996

反而证明了你的计划不起作用
which kind of proves your plan didn't work out,

997
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,920
我们的关系还没有终结
and our relationship isn't over.

998
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,400
我该怎么做
How'd I do?

1009
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,300
{\an9}*Calloused and so cold*

1010
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,790
{\an9}*All the way down*

1011
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,210
{\an9}*Every day*

1012
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,770
{\an9}*I'd like to talk to you*

1013
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,720
{\an9}*But I'm turning my face away*

1014
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,030

算是吧
I guess so.

1018
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,140
会对你造成困扰吗
Does that bother you?

1019
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,340
我不知道
I don't know.

1020
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:12,720
能一会儿决定一下这会不会困扰你吗
Can we decide whether it bothers you later?

1021
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:41,920
你们这群混蛋
You bastards.

1022
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,630
你们认为是我泄密的
You thought I leaked?

1023
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,710
你们搜查了我办公室
You searched my office.

1024
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,880
不  我们不知道是不是你泄密的
No, we didn't know whether you leaked or...

1025
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:53,100
是因为特朗普吧  与政治有关吧
This is about Trump. This is about politics.

1026
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,480
朱利叶斯  这是为了保持律所的正直性
Julius, this is about maintaining the integrity of this firm.

1027
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,120
不  我对你那么忠诚
No. I was loyal to you.

1028
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,400
我曾是你最忠诚的员工
I was the most loyal employee you had.

1029
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,860
我们得知道是谁泄密的
We had to know who was leaking.

1030
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,780
那你们调查过戴安了吗
And did you investigate Diane?

1033

1048
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,350
最好是什么都别做
I'm not sure there's anything you can do.

1049
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,530
他们就像是想惹怒父母的小孩
They're like kids wanting to upset Mommy and Daddy.

1050
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:22,990
戴安  问题是
Well, here's the problem, Diane.

1051
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,110
我确实很生气
I am upset.

1052
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:25,890
我知道
I know.

1053
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,120
他们这是针对那该死的委员会
You know, they're reacting to that damn committee.

1054
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,620
嗯  他们试图绕过我们实施的新规则
Yeah. They're working around the new rules we implemented.

1055
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,700
斯塔普斯搞出的这些麻烦必须要了结
This whole mess with Staples needs to end.

1056
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,850
他有很多支持者
He's got too many followers,

1057
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,100
他们威胁要离开我的网站
and they're threatening to leave my services,

1058
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,160
了结此事
so make it end.

1059
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,970
我们重新考虑过了
We've reconsidered.

1060
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,290
"重新考虑"
"Reconsidered"?

1061
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:49,880
我们准备解禁你的账号
We're prepared to overturn the ban

1062
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,320
恢复你的使用权
and reinstate you.

1063
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:52,810
什么
What?

1064
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,700
别走啊  事情才开始变得有趣
No, things were just getting interesting.

1065
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,720
-结束了  -我没...
- We're done. - I'm not...

1066
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:00,520
谢谢
Thank you.

1067
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,010
不  还没完呢  戴安
No, we're not done. Diane.

1068
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,120
戴安  我还有很多...
Diane, I've got a number of po...

1069
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,240
我...
I've...

1070
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,450
戴安
Diane!

1071
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,640
简直胡来
This is totally fucked!

1072
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,750
我是来自我辩解的  然后你们就这么溜了
I am here defending myself and what? You all slink off?

1073
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,960
斯塔普斯先生  都结束了
Mr. Staples. It's over. We're done.

1074
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,890
我们接受了你的思路  回家吧
We took the oxygen from your room. Go home.

1075
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,420
你看这则对我的新的人生攻击
I want you to read this new attack on me.

1076
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,550
"去死吧  你个基佬  言论自由早就过时了
"Die, you cocksucker. Free speech is outmoded.

1077
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:28,070
法律是由奴隶主书写的"
It's a law written by slave owners."

1078
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:29,580
你还想怎么样  斯塔普斯先生
What do you want, Mr. Staples?

1079
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,100
我们已经恢复了你的使用权
You've been reinstated.

1080
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,260
我不接受
I don't accept your reinstatement.

1081
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:37,990
你就是个小丑
You're a clown.

1082
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,980
更糟的是你是个聪明的小丑
What's worse is you're a smart clown

1083
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,050
偶尔说得还挺有道理
who occasionally has a point, 

1084
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:47,950
却因为与种族主义和厌女症混为一谈而毁了
a point you destroy by mixing it up with racism and misogyny

1085
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,930
而这些你可能根本不认可
you probably don't even believe.

1086
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,390
你小时候  有人拒绝了你  或是取笑你
When you were little, someone rejected you or made fun of you,

1087
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,200
现在你也成为了这种刻薄的人
and now you get to be one of the mean guys,

1088
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,090
取笑他人
making fun of others.

1089
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,680
而你就是道德标杆  对此义愤填膺吗
And you get to be the principal? Outraged?

1090
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,590
不  我只是有更重要的事要做
No, I just have better things to do.

1091
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:02,560
是吗
Oh, really?

1092
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,360
你以为这是对进步人士
You think this is some grand rebellion

1093
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,920
和社交正义战士的光荣反抗  其实不是
against progressives and social justice warriors, it's not.

1094
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:12,200
你只不过是个在角落尿裤子的小屁孩
You're just some kid in the corner pissing yourself,

1095
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,300
知足吧
so have at it.

1096
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,690
你输了  戴安
You've lost, Diane.

1097
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,300
你很生气
And you're upset

1098
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,320
因为我是言论自由的化身
'cause I'm the embodiment of free speech.

1099
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:27,750
不
No, 

1100
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,270
不过我们不得不忍受你的无理取闹
but you are what we have to tolerate,

1101
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,790
谢谢了
so thank you.

1102
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,470
走吧
Now go.

1103
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,440
走吧
Go.

1104
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:53,300
所以并没有真正被禁的吗
So, there were no real expulsions?

1105
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,670
有一个  但在申诉中被撤销了
One, but it was reversed on appeal.

1106
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,200
就是斯塔普斯吗
That was Staples?

1107
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:01,340
那你们审议会的泄露者呢
And, uh, the leak of your deliberations?

1108
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,410
是你们泄露的
That was from you.

1109
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:10,480
你是说我们泄露了审议会内容吗
You're saying we leaked your deliberations?

1110
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:12,320
是
Yes.

1111
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,520
-为什么  -我们是你的试探工具
- Why? - We were a trial balloon.

1112
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,120
你想要审查你的网站
You wanted to censor your sites,

1113
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,850
如果我们失败了  你能说我们才是问题
but if we failed, you could point to us as the problem:

1114
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:24,030
自由派非裔美国人律所
a liberal African- American firm.

1115
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,930
-是吗  -所以我们才在这里  先生
- Really? - That's why we're here, sir,

1116
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,180
让你面上好看
to make you look good.

1117

很好  谢谢
Okay, good. Thanks.

我在海外还有些问题
Um, I, uh, I have a few issues overseas.

1119
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,740
你们有时间吗  艾德里安  芭芭拉
Do you have a minute, Adrian, Barbara?

1120
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,780
-有  -很好
- We do. - Good.

1121
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,550
需要我做什么吗
Do you need anything from me?

1122
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,110
不用了  我们就行  谢谢
No, I think we're good. Thanks.

1123
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:20,520
你在干什么
What are you doing...

1124
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,640
我要跟你谈谈
I need a second.

什么事
What?

你近期没有要升职合伙人吧
You're not up for partner anytime soon, are you?

1127
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,190
没  据我所知没有
No, not that I know of.

1128
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,000
你最好...
You should, uh...

1129
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,210
跟你们律所从经济上撇清关系
stay clear of your firm's finances.

1130
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,420
为什么
Why?

1131
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:51,780
雷迪克&博斯曼从一个客户手上收了80万贿赂
Reddick/Boseman took an $800,000 bribe from a client.

1132
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,440
