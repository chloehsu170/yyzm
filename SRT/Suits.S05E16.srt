{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,710
监狱毁了克利福德的一生
Prison ruined Clifford's life.

16
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,180
如果你是我们的律师
And if you had been our lawyer,

17
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,680
他根本不会被判有罪
he never would have been convicted in the first place.

18
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,670
你想怎样
What do you want?

19
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,040
你坐两年牢
You do two years in prison,

20
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,420
我就放过你的朋友们
and I won't go after any of your friends.

21
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,180
这是唯一有把握的让事情归于平息方法
It's the only sure way to put this to bed

22
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,620
并能保证
and make sure that the only person

23
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,130
受损失的只有我一人
who is hurt by it is me.

24
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,050
那我呢
What about me?

25
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,840
我也只是爱你啊
All I did was love you.

26
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,040
我不会出卖他们的
I'm not gonna rat them out.

27
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,250
我不是劝你出卖他们
I'm not asking you to.

28
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,320
我只是希望你能对自己多点信心
I'm just asking you to have faith in yourself.

29
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,560
别再自愿承担后果了
Don't fall on your sword again.

30
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,320
我们可能赢不了
We might not win.

31
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,810
你不需要永远都做英雄
You don't always have to be the hero.

32
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,560
我那么做不是为了当英雄
I'm not doing it to be the hero.

33
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,050
那你为了什么
Then why the hell are you doing it?

34
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,470
我绝不会把朋友送进监狱的
I would never send my friends to prison.

35
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,320
如果他们给我定罪
They find me guilty,

36
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,420
也一样会送我朋友进监狱
they're gonna send my friends to prison anyways.

37
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,460
陪审团出来了  我们有一小时时间
The jury came back. We have an hour.

38
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,450
迈克呢
Where's Mike?

39
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,500
我不知道
I don't know.

40
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,820
我准备好接受协议了
I'm ready to take your deal.

41
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,020
哪个协议
Which one?

42
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,370
我们说清楚
So just to be clear,

43
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,190
你要的是这一份
this is the one you want to go with.

44
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,120
你入狱两年  你的朋友们不受指控
You go to prison for two years, your friends go free,

45
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,950
定下之后不得反悔
and no crying about it once it's done.

46
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,100
加个条件
One stipulation.

47
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,030
服刑时间一分钟都不能减
I'm not reducing your jail time by one minute.

48
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,100
不是这个
That's not it.

49
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,630
我要你写清楚  我们签字后
I want you to write in that once we sign,

50
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,260
你不能再跟哈维重新定协议
you can't renegotiate with Harvey.

51
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,810
我知道了
Oh, I get it.

52
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,380
你是担心我会用这个
You're afraid I'm gonna use this

53
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,820
让他替你挡子弹
to get him to take the bullet for you.

54
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,190
我不是怕你会那么做
I'm not afraid of you trying to do that,

55
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,540
我知道你会那么做
because I know you will.

56
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,590
要么你写进去  要么我们等判决
So, either put it in, or we go to verdict.

57
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,240
记住  就像你对我说的
And just remember, like you said to me,

58
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,660
时间不多了
tick tock.

59
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,540
你做了什么
What did you do?

60
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,060
我必须做的
I did what I had to do.

61
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,760
我认罪了
I pled guilty.

62
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,250
胡扯
Bullshit.

63
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,820
你没认罪
You didn't plead anything.

64
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,840
哈维  看着我
Harvey, look at me.

65
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,900
是我犯了罪
It was my crime.

66
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,040
这是我的决定
It was my choice to make,

67
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,900
我做了决定
and I made it.

68
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,440
已经结束了
It's done.

69
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,530
我要推翻
Well, I'm gonna unmake it,

70
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,090
法官还没批准呢
because the judge hasn't ratified it yet,

71
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,100
在此之前  什么都没结束
and until she does, nothing is done.

72
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,100
哈维  停下
Harvey, stop.

73
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,200
不  你听我说
No, you listen to me.

74
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,840
如果你以为我会让你这么做
If you think I'm gonna let you do this,

75
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,660
你就是疯了
you're out of your goddamn mind.

76
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,420
做什么  迈克
Do what, Mike?

77
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,970
你做了什么
What did you do?

78
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,870
我接受了两年的协议
I took the two years.

79
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,330
-不  不会的  -瑞秋  求你
- No, no, you didn't. - Rachel, Rachel, please.

80
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,730
-我不接受  -听我说
- I don't accept that. - Please listen.

81
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,870
只有这样我才能...
It was the only way that I could--

82
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,790
不  不是只有这条路
No, it wasn't the only way.

83
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,160
你说你会等待判决的
You told me that you'd wait for the verdict,

84
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,150
我求你要相信自己
and I begged you to have faith in yourself,

85
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,960
你也说你会的
and you told me that you would.

86
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,860
那是在我求迪亚兹接受一个
That was before I begged Diaz to take a deal

87
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,890
出卖朋友的协议之前
that would rat out his friend,

88
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,720
他没听我说
and he didn't listen to me--

89
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,860
等等  你要放弃
Wait a second. You're throwing away

90
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,740
我们接下来的两年生活
the next two years of our lives

91
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,620
就因为个罪犯的话
for something that some criminal said?

92
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,350
-停下  听我说  -等等
- Just stop. Listen to me. - Hold on.

93
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,070
哈维说他不会允许这事发生
Harvey said he wasn't gonna let this happen.

94
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,420
他去见法官了  是吧
He went to see the judge, didn't he?

95
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,250
无所谓  他阻止不了
It doesn't matter. He can't stop it.

96
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,960
-为什么  -因为这事不在他
- Why not? - Because it's not up to him.

97
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,140
在我  我已经决定了
It's up to me, and I've made my decision.

98
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,360
瑞秋  你去哪
Rachel, where are you going?

99
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,800
哪儿都行
Anywhere else.

100
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,750
如果你要夺走
Because if you're gonna rob us

101
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,880
我们接下来两年的生活
of the next two years of our lives,

102
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,490
我不会站在这儿看着你那么做
I am not gonna stand here and watch you do it.

103
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,390
吉布斯女士  我不喜欢等人
Ms. Gibbs, I don't appreciate being kept waiting

104
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,550
尤其陪审团已经达成判决了
once the jury has informed us they've reached a verdict.

105
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,300
抱歉  法官大人
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

106
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,890
罗斯先生和我刚刚在敲定一份认罪协议
Mr. Ross and I were finalizing a plea agreement.

107
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,260
我也抱歉  法官大人
I'm sorry too, Your Honor,

108
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,230
但他们狗屁都没敲定
but they haven't finalized shit.

109
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,030
你刚刚在我的法庭上说了什么
What did you just say in my courtroom?

110
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,230
您没听错
You heard what I said.

111
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,280
立刻去我办公室
My chambers, right now.

112
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,900
瑞秋  我听说陪审团出来了
Rachel, I heard the jury is back.

113
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,030
我来听判决的
I came down to hear the verdict.

114
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,930
不会有判决了
There's not gonna be a verdict,

115
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,010
你掉头回去吧
so you can turn right around,

116
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,090
迈克认了罪  要去蹲两年监狱了
because Mike took a deal to spend two years in prison.

117
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,320
天呐
Oh, my god.

118
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,460
他们正在里面
And they're in there right now

119
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,510
签字呢
signing off on it.

120
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,980
我不知道该怎么办
And I don't know what to do.

121
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,380
好吧  我告诉你你该干什么
Okay, I'll tell you what you need to do.

122
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,610
你得回去
You need to go back inside,

123
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,110
陪在他身边
and you need to be there for him.

124
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,020
我才不要
I'm not gonna go back inside and be there for him.

125
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,530
为什么
Why not?

126
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,780
因为他之前跟我说他不会这么做
Because he told me that he wasn't going to do this.

127
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,060
他告诉我有这个协议
He told me that it was on the table,

128
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,350
我求他不要接受
and I begged him not to take it,

129
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,230
他答应我不会
and he promised me that he wouldn't.

130
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,130
瑞秋  哈维昨晚来找我
Rachel, last night Harvey came to me

131
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,060
也想这么做
wanting to do the same thing,

132
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,100
我求他要相信陪审团的
and I begged him to have faith in that jury.

133
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,330
哈维守了诺言
And Harvey kept his word.

134
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,660
但他也可能打破的
But he might not have,

135
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,720
我告诉自己  即便他改了主意
and I told myself that if he changed his mind,

136
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,320
我也必须原谅他
I would have to forgive him.

137
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,490
唐娜  你是个比我好的人
Then Donna, you're a better woman than I am,

138
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,810
因为迈克就是我的心
because Mike is my heart,

139
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,180
现在我感觉好像有人把我的心
and right now I feel like someone is ripping my heart

140
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,200
从胸膛里扯了出来  而那个人
out of my chest, and that someone--

141
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,780
就是他
that someone's him.

142
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,850
法官大人  我不管什么协议
Your Honor, I don't give a shit about that deal.

143
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,460
她占了我的委托人的便宜
She took advantage of my client.

144
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,130
她强迫了他  您有权力阻止她
She coerced him, and you have the power to stop it.

145
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,780
我受够了你的粗口  斯佩克特先生
I've had enough of your language, Mr. Specter.

146
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,980
并非强迫
It wasn't coercion.

147
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,020
这是一位有能力的律师进行商定的
It was negotiated by a competent attorney.

148
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,260
毫无问题  你也没有阻止它的依据
It's rock solid, and there's no basis to stop it.

149
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,270
他不是位有能力的律师
He's not a competent attorney.

150
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,180
他要承认诈骗罪签订协议呢
He's cutting a deal to plead guilty to fraud.

151
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,640
你想跟我签别的协议吗  我乐意听听
You want to cut a different deal with me? I'm all ears.

152
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,960
但问题是
Yeah, the only problem with that

153
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,220
你不能签别的协议了
is you can't sign a different deal,

154
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,720
因为你已经签字放弃这一权利了
because you already signed your rights to that away.

155
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,900
该死的  迈克  别这么做
God damn it, Mike, don't do this.

156
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,430
我们可以等判决
We can go to verdict.

157
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,370
别跟我来那套
Don't give me that.

158
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,800
你冲去她的办公室
You weren't racing over to her office

159
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,780
不是为了告诉她陪审团回来了
to tell her that the jury was back.

160
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780
你是想用自己的身体挡手雷
You were going to jump on the grenade,

161
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,680
而我先你一步
and I beat you to it.

162
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
我说了  结束了  已经结束了
Now I told you it's done, and it's done.

163
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,800
你确定吗  罗斯先生
Are you absolutely sure, Mr. Ross?

164
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,470
是的  法官大人
I am, Your Honor.

165
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,690
那么  罗斯先生  给你72小时
Then, Mr. Ross, you have 72 hours

166
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,130
去丹伯里联邦监狱报到
to report to Danbury Federal Prison.

167
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,410
{\an8}诉讼双雄
第五季  第十六集

168
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,330
直接告诉我结果
Give it to me straight.

169
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,950
什么情况
What happened?

170
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,050
迈克认罪了  作为交换
Mike pled guilty, and in exchange,

171
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,940
他们不能再动你  哈维  路易  我们任何人
they can't go after you, Harvey, Louis, or any of us.

172
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,080
该死
Shit.

173
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,560
作为刚刚得知
For someone who just found out

174
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,840
自己不会进监狱的人来说  你不太高兴呢
she's not going to prison, you don't seem happy.

175
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,210
我担心的从来不是进监狱  唐娜
I was never worried about going to prison, Donna.

176
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,850
那你担心什么
What are you worried about?

177
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,260
失去我的律所
Losing my firm.

178
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,830
迈克认了罪  他经手过的每一桩案子
Now that Mike pled guilty, every case he ever touched

179
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,600
都将变成"官司"
has "lawsuit" written all over it.

180
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,880
那我们要怎么办
So what are we gonna do?

181
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,490
我告诉你我们要怎么办
I'll tell you what we're going to do.

182
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,970
我们要重组这家律所
We're gonna restructure this firm,

183
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,430
而且我们得在官司打起来前就重组
and we're gonna do it before the lawsuits even start.

184
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,070
把路易叫来
Get me Louis.

185
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,470
迈克
Michael.

186
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,730
格洛丽亚  你在这里干什么
Gloria, what are you doing here?

187
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,560
我过来陪你听判决的
I came here to be with you for the verdict,

188
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,370
但他们告诉我你达成了协议
but they told me you made a deal.

189
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,060
的确
I did.

190
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,530
迈克  主怎么能让我看着两个
Michael, there's no way the lord would have

191
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,650
无辜的人去坐牢啊
put me through two innocent men going away.

192
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,860
但是丹纳女士  我并不无辜
But Mrs. Danner, I'm not innocent,

193
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,190
我确实做了他们所控诉我的那些事
and I did what they accused me of.

194
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,900
我又不傻  迈克
I'm not stupid, Michael.

195
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,690
我不是说你上过法学院
I didn't mean you went to law school.

196
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,940
我是说你的内心是清白的
I meant you are innocent in your heart,

197
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,940
而如今你却选择去一个
and now you've chosen to go to a place

198
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,620
满是内心不清白的人的地方
filled with men who aren't.

199
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,760
我想您是没搞清楚
I don't think you understand.

200
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,100
我要去的是一个白领监狱
I'm going to a white-collar prison.

201
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,300
大门一关  根本没有什么
There's no such thing as a white-collar prison

202
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,230
白领监狱一说
once they close those doors.

203
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,350
你得听我的
You need to hear me.

204
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,060
格洛丽亚  听着  我知道你是想帮我
Gloria, look, I know that you are trying to help,

205
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,930
但我是为了自己的所为承担责任
but I took responsibility for what I did,

206
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,810
我将要忍受这一点
and I'm gonna live with it.

207
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,150
但目前  我得去和我爱的女人待在一起
But right now, I need to go spend time with the woman I love

208
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,030
并且把事情处理好
and make things right,

209
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,230
所以很抱歉  容我先行一步
so I'm sorry, but you have to excuse me.

210
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,060
罗伯特  我收到你的信息
Robert, I got your message.

211
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,720
就马上赶来了
I rushed right over.

212
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,660
瑞秋怎么了
What happened to Rachel?

213
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,890
我告诉你她怎么了
I'll tell you what happened.

214
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,050
迈克・罗斯要进监狱了
Mike Ross is going to jail,

215
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,060
我的女儿心都碎了
my daughter is heartbroken,

216
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,280
但哈维和杰西卡却毫发无伤地脱罪了
and Harvey and Jessica are getting off scot-free.

217
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,890
等等  假如你把我引下来
Wait a second. If you lured me down here

218
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,150
只是因为想找个出气筒
because you wanted a punching bag,

219
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,590
我可以告诉你  那种事不可能发生
I can tell you right now, that's not gonna happen.

220
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,410
我来告诉你会发生什么
Well, let me tell you what is gonna happen.

221
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,670
马上  迈克用他那毫无意义的名字
It's about to be open season on every case

222
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,170
签过的每一桩案子  都要被问责
that Mike Ross ever put his good-for-nothing name on,

223
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,470
一旦那开始了
and once that happens,

224
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,660
或早或晚
it's just a matter of time

225
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,230
你门手下每个律师都会试图跳槽
until every one of your attorneys tries to leave.

226
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,290
我明白这是怎么回事了
I see what this is.

227
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,210
你想利用我来引发一场
You want to use me to start an avalanche

228
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,860
会活埋了哈维和杰西卡的雪崩
that will bury Harvey and Jessica.

229
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,480
你猜怎么着
Guess what?

230
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,430
我不会干这种事的
I'm not gonna do it.

231
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,010
那你就是比我想象中还要蠢了
Then you're a bigger fool than I thought,

232
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,610
因为我会找到一个愿意做的人
because I'm gonna find someone that will.

233
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,480
祝你好运  因为我们有竞业条款
Good luck with that, because we have a noncompete.

234
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,600
不  你们已经没有了
Not anymore, you don't.

235
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,620
放屁  你是在虚张声势
Bullshit. You're bluffing.

236
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,970
你何不去问问你的前律师卡特里娜
Then why don't you go and ask your ex-associate Katrina?

237
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,160
因为一开始就是她给我提供的
Because she's the one that gave me

238
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,990
这个规避规则的办法
the way around it in the first place.

239
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,850
哈维  我听说了迈克的事了
Harvey, I heard about Mike.

240
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,870
真是太可惜了
I am so sorry.

241
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,100
别可惜了
Well, you can stop being sorry

242
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,870
给我搞到那个陪审团主席的名字
and get me the name of that jury foreman.

243
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,430
哈维  你申请不到无效审判的
Harvey, you can't get a mistrial.

244
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,790
已经太迟了  迈克已经达成协议了
It's too late. Mike cut a deal.

245
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,610
我不需要法律建议  唐娜
I don't need legal advice, Donna.

246
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,790
我只需要那个主席的姓名和住址
I need the name and address of that foreman.

247
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,930
我不认为那是个好主意
I don't think that's a good idea.

248
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,710
又不是要犯法  唐娜
It's not breaking the law anymore, Donna.

249
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,720
只是叫你帮个忙
It's just a favor.

250
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,850
我又不会毁了他的生活
I'm not gonna ruin his life.

251
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,510
我只需要问他一个该死的问题
I just need to ask him a goddamn question.

252
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,140
在你告诉我那个问题是什么之前
Well, I'm not gonna do that until you tell me

253
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,390
我是不会帮你的
what that question is.

254
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,480
唐娜...
Donna...

255
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,200
迈克刚刚抛弃了自己的整个人生
Mike just threw his whole life away,

256
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,900
而我却对此无能为力
and there's nothing I can do about it,

257
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,870
唯一能让我接受这一点的方式
and the only way that I can accept it

258
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,280
就是我去问清楚原本的判决是什么
is if I find out what that verdict was gonna be.

259
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,820
我帮你去搞到名字
I'll get you the name.

260
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,860
罗伯特・赞恩刚刚告诉我
Robert Zane just told me

261
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,980
他能规避我们的竞业条款
he can take away our noncompete.

262
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,250
我要你立马告诉我他要如何做到这一点
I need you to tell me right now how he's gonna do that.

263
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,760
很高兴见到你  路易
Nice to see you too, Louis.

264
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,080
我能给你来杯李子泥吗
Can I offer you a prunie?

265
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,030
不  我不要什么该死的李子泥
No, I don't need a damn prunie.

266
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,560
我需要你告诉我他在打什么主意
I need you to tell me what he's up to.

267
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,100
路易  我如今人在这里
Louis, I'm here now,

268
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,890
而我之所以在这里
and the reason I'm here

269
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,130
是因为我因帮你而被开除了
is that I got fired for helping you,

270
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,100
而且即便你保证过在你成为冠名合伙人后
and even though you promised to bring me back

271
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,530
就让我回去
once you were named partner,

272
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,860
但你失约了
you didn't.

273
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,930
不不不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

274
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,900
我想让你回来  卡特里娜  非常想
I wanted to bring you back, Katrina, more than anything.

275
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,940
别和我来这一套  路易
Don't give me that, Louis.

276
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,680
在希拉甩了你之后我为你打掩护
I covered for you after Sheila dumped you.

277
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,470
我帮你挖到了回春制药
I helped you poach Versalife.

278
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,420
我甚至帮你伪造了政府文件
I even forged government documents for you.

279
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,720
好吧  卡特里娜  我想要让你回来
Okay, Katrina, I wanted to bring you back,

280
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,910
但我没办法保护你不受...
I couldn't protect you--

281
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,130
不受什么
From what?

282
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,550
不受发现迈克・罗斯是骗子这个真相的伤害吗
From finding out Mike Ross is a fraud?

283
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,730
没错  我算过了  路易
Yeah, I did the math, Louis,

284
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,380
你没办法保护我不受这件事的伤害
and you couldn't have protected me from it,

285
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,190
却可以利用这点让自己当上冠名合伙人
but you could use it to get your name on the door,

286
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,260
是不是
couldn't you?

287
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,330
你要看着我的眼睛告诉我事实并非如此吗
Are you gonna look me in the eye and tell me that isn't true?

288
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,030
事实就是如此
It's true.

289
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,030
我感激你的坦诚
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

290
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,030
既然你对我坦诚  我也会对你坦诚
Since you were honest with me, I'll be honest with you.

291
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,700
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

292
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,940
你还好吧
Are you okay?

293
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,170
不好
No.

294
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,230
瑞秋...
Rachel...

295
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,440
我就是不明白  迈克
I just don't understand, Mike.

296
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,870
你告诉过我你会等判决出来
You told me you'd wait for the verdict.

297
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,960
我知道
I know.

298
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,450
瑞秋  听我说  好吗
Rachel, listen to me, all right?

299
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,870
我这么做不是想伤害你
I didn't do this to hurt you.

300
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,720
我这么做是因为我本性如此
I did it because it's who I am.

301
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,480
我明白
I know that.

302
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,190
那你为什么还要怪我呢
Then why are you holding it against me?

303
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,920
因为一想到要失去你我就无法忍受
Because I can't stand the thought of losing you.

304
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,740
你不会失去我的
You're not gonna lose me.

305
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,830
不  我会的  迈克  要失去两年
Yes, I am, Mike, for two years.

306
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,850
本来可能是七年呢
And it could have been seven.

307
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,510
-也可能是无罪  -他们...
- It could have been zero. - They took--

308
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,330
你为什么就不能等到判决出来呢
Why couldn't you just wait for the verdict?

309
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,680
因为我只求下半辈子
Because I have to live with myself

310
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,070
过得心安理得
for the rest of my life.

311
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,030
我做出了决定  而我...
I made a decision, and I...

312
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,830
我没办法回到过去改变主意了
I can't go back in time and change it.

313
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,960
但如今我们在这里呢
But we are here right now, all right?

314
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,750
我们还有三天时间
We have--we have three days left.

315
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,530
我得抽出一天独自待着
I'm gonna have to take one of those days for myself...

316
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,690
因为你向我保证过你会对自己有信心的
because you promised me that you would have faith in yourself.

317
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,150
但你失约了
And you didn't.

318
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,700
记得我吗
You remember me?

319
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,660
怎么可能不记得
How could I not?

320
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,170
我听你说话听了快两周的时间
I listened to you for the better part of two weeks.

321
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,530
那我就直说了
Then I'll get right to it.

322
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,780
我需要你帮我个忙
I need a favor.

323
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,000
你有卡车要修吗
You got a truck needs fixing?

324
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,220
我想知道最终的判决是什么
I want to know what that verdict was gonna be.

325
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,420
你不想
No, you don't.

326
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,470
是的  我想
Yeah, I do.

327
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,920
知道了又有什么不同呢
What difference does it make?

328
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,970
大有不同
It makes all the difference in the world.

329
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,880
那我就告诉你
Then I'll tell you,

330
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,590
因为我非常想告诉别人
'cause I've been dying to tell somebody,

331
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,070
因为我们就像《十二怒汉》一样
'cause it was "12 angry men" in there,

332
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,320
而我就是那一个异类
And I was the one.

333
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,100
是的
Yeah, that's right.

334
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,980
我一个又一个的将他们争取过来
One by one, I put that jury on my back

335
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,520
然后做了正确的决定
and we did the right thing.

336
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,800
什么是正确的决定
What's the right thing?

337
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,150
你以为我不知道真相吗
You think I don't know what's what?

338
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,690
那个孩子并没有读过法学院
That kid didn't go to law school.

339
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,480
你知  我知
You know it, I know it,

340
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,610
那个屋子里的所有人都知道
everybody in the goddamn room knew it.

341
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,780
是有罪
It was guilty.

342
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,910
我没那么说
I didn't say that.

343
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,790
那个女人的案子站不住脚
That woman didn't make her case,

344
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,750
我也不会让我的国家的司法体制
and I'm not letting my country's justice system

345
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,350
在我的手上沾上污点
go to shit on my watch.

346
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,860
说吧
Say it.

347
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,740
无罪
Not guilty.

348
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,140
他们说你们接受了个协议
They told us you guys cut some kind of deal.

349
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,400
你们应该对体制多点信心的
Guess you should have had a little more faith in the system.

350
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,370
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter?

351
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,190
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter.

352
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,720
丹纳女士  您有什么事
Mrs. Danner, what can I do for you?

353
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,070
我试图说服迈克  但他不听
I tried to talk to Michael, but he wouldn't listen.

354
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:06,980
说服他什么
Talk to him about what?

355
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,970
告诉他监狱里面是什么样子
About what's gonna happen to him inside that prison.

356
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,850
丹纳女士  我很感激你到这里来
Mrs. Danner, I appreciate you coming down here,

357
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,450
但我现在不能和你聊这些
but I can't talk about this right now.

358
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,730
我不在乎
I don't care.

359
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,120
你必须听我说
You're gonna listen to what I have to say,

360
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,110
我知道监狱对我儿子的影响  斯佩克特先生
because I saw what prison did to my son, Mr. Specter.

361
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,350
迈克需要知道
Michael needs to know

362
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,090
进去之后的第一天是什么样子
what his first day is gonna be like,

363
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,260
应该和什么样的人交朋友
who to make friends with,

364
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,720
要远离哪些警卫
what guards to stay away from,

365
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,400
因为警卫才是最可怕的
because it's the guards that are the worst.

366
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,200
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know all that?

367
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,260
那就做些什么帮帮那个孩子
Then do something to toughen up that boy.

368
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,160
我说了  我现在不能谈这些
I told you, I can't talk about this right now.

369
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,420
随你便
Go ahead.

370
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,380
走吧
Walk away.

371
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,720
但你欠我的
But you owe me.

372
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,330
你或许救出了我儿子
Because you may have gotten him out,

373
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,220
但是也正是因为你
but you're also the one who put him in that hellhole

374
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,810
他才会进去
in the first place.

375
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,090
路易  你到底去哪了
Louis, where the hell have you been?

376
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,880
-我们有麻烦了  -你以为我不知道
- We have a problem. - You think I don't know that?

377
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,230
我需要你把律所分割
I need you to bifurcate the firm

378
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,280
成两个实体  我需要你现在就去弄
into two entities, and I need you to do it now.

379
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,140
我知道你的想法
I know what you're thinking.

380
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,080
如果我们把客户隔离  我们就可以留住律师
If we insulate our clients, we can hold on to our lawyers,

381
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,180
但那并没有什么用
but that won't help.

382
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,030
为什么没用
Why the hell not?

383
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,680
因为罗伯特・赞恩已经找到方法规避
Because Robert Zane has a way to 

384
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,610
我们的竞业条款了
bust our noncompete.

385
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,670
该死的
God damn it.

386
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,240
他找到一个愿意去的人
He finds somebody to jump ship,

387
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,760
那就会有一帮人蜂拥去投奔他
it'll be a stampede for the exits.

388
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,900
这正是我想说的
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

389
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,740
好吧  那就不用分割律所了
All right, then forget about splitting the firm

390
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,340
去查一下他想挖谁
and work on figuring out what the hell he's up to,

391
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,560
不然我们根本不会剩下什么律所了
or there won't be a firm left to split.

392
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,850
我需要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

393
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,470
不行  迈克  现在不行
I can't, Mike, not now.

394
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,530
哈维  我需要知道你是否认为
Harvey, I need to know if you think

395
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,030
认罪是正确的决定
I did the right thing taking that plea.

396
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,350
该死的  你现在倒来问我了
God damn it, you ask me that now?

397
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,730
瑞秋无法接受
Rachel can't get past the fact

398
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,340
我没有等到判决就做决定
that I didn't wait for the verdict to come in.

399
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,170
她非常伤心  我也因此而心痛
It's tearing her up, and that's tearing me up.

400
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,310
-迈克  -哈维  我知道你很生气
- Mike-- - Harvey, I know that you are pissed

401
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,840
我在你之前就达成了协议
that I made a deal before you,

402
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,370
但是我需要你告诉我我的决定是正确的
but I need you to tell me that I made the right call.

403
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,670
你做得对
You did.

404
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,040
你怎么知道
How can you be sure?

405
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,440
因为我去找过陪审团主席
Because I went to see the foreman,

406
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,450
他告诉我他们的判决是有罪
and he told me the verdict was guilty.

407
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,500
什么
What?

408
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,610
听着  你进监狱这件事也让我非常难过
Look, the idea of you going to prison was killing me,

409
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,310
如果我不知道结果会一直纠结
and I couldn't let it go unless I knew.

410
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,620
但你现在不用了
But now you can.

411
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,720
我仍然希望你能让我替你承受这一切
I still wish you would have let me take the hit instead of you,

412
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,290
但是的  现在不纠结了
but yeah, I can.

413
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,320
回家吧  迈克
Go home, Mike.

414
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,470
用你所剩的时间去陪瑞秋吧
Get whatever time left you have with Rachel.

415
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,080
现在轻松多了
It's gonna be easier now.

416
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,250
从没想过"有罪"两个字还能有这种效果
I never thought the word "Guilty" would do that.

417
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,460
你还好吗
Are you all right?

418
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,340
我没事
I'm fine.

419
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,930
我能帮你做些什么吗
Can I get you anything?

420
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,160
是的
Yeah.

421
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,250
清空你今天的所有安排
Clear your schedule for the rest of the day.

422
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,830
我需要你帮我搜集迈克庭审的所有资料
I need you to get me everything there is to get from Mike's trial.

423
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,980
哈维  我不明白
Harvey, I don't understand.

424
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,340
你说如果你和那个陪审团主席聊过
You said if you talked to that foreman,

425
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,920
你就能放下这件事了
you would be able to make peace with this.

426
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,800
我不在乎我说了什么
I don't care what I said.

427
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,950
但他说了迈克有罪
And he said that Mike was guilty,

428
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,170
迈克也接受了这结果
and Mike accepted those consequences.

429
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,570
他没说迈克有罪
He didn't say Mike was guilty.

430
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,160
他说他是无辜的
He said he was goddamn innocent.

431
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,300
我的天哪
Oh, my god.

432
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,820
他要白白承受牢狱之灾了
He's going away for nothing.

433
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,070
不  唐娜  他根本不会去坐牢
No, Donna, he's not going away at all.

434
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,050
你需要我做什么
What do you need me to do?

435
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,040
我需要你帮我
I need you to get me

436
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,540
整理案件的全部信息
everything we have on that trial,

437
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,620
因为我要找到方法
because I'm gonna figure out a way

438
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,660
让那个协议无效
to invalidate that goddamn deal.

439
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,570
杰西卡  你有时间吗
Jessica, do you have a minute?

440
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,340
我现在真的很忙  杰克
I'm really busy right now, Jack.

441
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,360
恐怕这件事不能等
I'm afraid this can't wait.

442
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,760
我正式向你提出辞呈
I'm officially giving you my letter of resignation.

443
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,930
我猜猜
Let me guess.

444
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,410
罗伯特・赞恩向你发出了邀请
Robert Zane made you an offer.

445
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,770
是的
He did,

446
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,360
尽管我非常不想接受
and as much as I didn't want to take it,

447
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,200
但我不得不
I have to.

448
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,500
不得不
Oh, you have to?

449
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,020
你求我再给你一次机会
You begged me for a second chance

450
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,560
然后又是第三次  第四次机会
and a third and a fourth,

451
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,890
我每次都答应了
and I gave them all to you,

452
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,810
现在他是要利用你摧毁我们
and now he's using you to destroy us.

453
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,900
我们已经被摧毁了
We're already destroyed.

454
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,190
你只是不想接受现实
You just don't want to accept it.

455
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,530
不  这只是个挫折
No, this is a setback.

456
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,740
对不起
I'm sorry.

457
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,550
杰克
Jack.

458
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,010
我觉得你忘记了你给过我一个文件夹
I think you're forgetting about that folder you gave me,

459
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,900
那个证明你有些许不检点的文件夹
the one with the little legal indiscretion

460
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,800
也就是丹尼尔・哈德曼手里的小辫子
Daniel Hardman had on you.

461
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,320
不要说得那么委婉  杰西卡
Let's not soft-pedal it, Jessica.

462
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,440
那不是不检点  那直接就是犯罪
It wasn't an indiscretion. It was a flat-out crime.

463
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,000
如果把它公之于众
And the problem with you using it is,

464
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,300
就相当于告诉全世界
you'll be announcing to the world

465
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,510
你眼皮底下发生了另一桩犯罪
yet another crime happened under your watch,

466
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,080
而你却没有阻止
and you did nothing to stop it.

467
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,970
而之前愿意留下的客户
And whatever clients were willing to stay with you before

468
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,630
也不会愿意了
won't be willing to anymore.

469
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,950
我想我最想念的会是这个
I think I'm gonna miss this the most.

470
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,030
想念什么
Miss what?

471
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,500
回家见到你
Coming home to you.

472
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,450
瑞秋  我知道我在签协议之前
Rachel, I know I should have told you what I was gonna do

473
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,900
应该告诉你
before I made that deal,

474
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,910
但我之前也不知道我会那样做
but I didn't know I was gonna do it,

475
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,550
我只有  三秒左右的时间做决定
and I had, like, three seconds to make a decision.

476
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,970
而那三秒拿走了整整两年
And those three seconds took away two whole years.

477
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,620
其实  是还给了我们五年
Actually, gave us back five.

478
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,310
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

479
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,880
哈维找到了陪审团主席
Harvey found the jury foreman.

480
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,400
他们本来要判我有罪
They were gonna find me guilty.

481
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,940
我们只有三天时间  我却浪费了一天
And we only had three days, and I took away one of them.

482
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,070
没关系的
Hey, it's okay.

483
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,800
瑞秋  我不在乎
Rachel, I don't care.

484
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,160
只要我们没事就好
As long as we're good.

485
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,120
我不要我们只是没事而已
I don't want us to just be good.

486
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,790
我要我们在一起
I want us to be one.

487
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,310
我想在你走之前成为你的妻子
I want to be your wife before you go.

488
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,090
我想成为你的丈夫
I want to be your husband.

489
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,910
我弄了点咖啡来
Okay, I got us some coffees and--

490
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,570
唐娜  搞什么  这不是所有的东西
Donna, what the hell? This isn't everything.

491
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,440
什么叫这不是所有的东西
What do you mean, this isn't everything?

492
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,150
我是说  她得提交动议
I mean, she had to have filed motions

493
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,800
申请传票  然后搜查
and subpoenas and discovery,

494
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,310
而这些东西什么都不是
And all this shit is nothing.

495
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,420
-哈维  这几箱是  -什么
- Harvey, these boxes are-- - what?

496
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,270
这是没有他在上面的班级排名
This is his class ranking that he wasn't on.

497
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,290
这是他的成绩单
This is his transcript.

498
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,680
这是他的年鉴
This is his yearbook.

499
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,760
我们可以在程序上反击的东西在哪里
Where are the things that we can attack procedurally?

500
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,430
在那边
They're over there.

501
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,780
那你为什么还没理清楚那些
Then why haven't you gone through them?

502
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,030
因为那不是我要做的
Because that's not what I do.

503
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,940
那你在这里到底是在干什么
Then what in god's name are you doing in here?

504
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,960
我在支持你  哈维  而现在
I'm supporting you, Harvey, and right now,

505
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,010
我要给你点空间
I'm gonna do that by giving you some space.

506
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,100
如果你以为你可以大摇大摆的
If you think you can waltz into my firm

507
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,940
走进我的公司  挖走我的律师
and take my lawyers,

508
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,680
你一定是疯了
you must be out of your damn mind.

509
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,150
让我猜猜  你要告我引诱
Let me guess, you're suing me for inducement.

510
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,770
那是当然
You bet your ass I am.

511
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,360
你引诱杰克・索罗夫违反他的竞业限制
You induced Jack Soloff into breaking his noncompete.

512
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,810
你对杰克・索罗夫或者其他人都没有竞业限制
You don't have a noncompete with jack soloff or anyone else.

513
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,670
我听说你用这句空话吓了路易
I heard you tried that empty threat with Louis,

514
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,780
但这招对我没用
but it's not gonna work with me.

515
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,980
如果这是空话
If it is empty,

516
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,330
那你的道德条款和章程也都是空话
then so is your morals clause and your bylaws,

517
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,380
因为里面说如果有冠名合伙人
which states that if a named partner

518
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,350
参与犯罪活动  所有合伙人都可以离开
participates in a crime, any partner is free to go.

519
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,490
而共谋诈骗就是该死的犯罪
And conspiracy to commit fraud is a goddamn crime.

520
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,570
你无法证明我们之前知道迈克・罗斯的事
You can't prove we knew about Mike Ross.

521
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,810
那我建议你去问问路易・利特
Well, let me suggest that you ask Louis Litt

522
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,040
他今天早上跟卡特里娜・班尼特说了什么
about his conversation with Katrina Bennett this morning.

523
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,210
我抓到你的把柄了  杰西卡
I got you, Jessica,

524
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,310
如果你因为我雇了杰克
And if you want to come after me

525
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,480
或者别人雇了什么人  就来对付我
for hiring jack, or anyone for hiring anyone,

526
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,870
你可能不用进监狱
You may not go to jail,

527
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,790
但是全世界都会知道你的所作所为
but the world is gonna know what you did.

528
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,520
你为什么要这么做  罗伯特
Why are you doing this, Robert?

529
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,960
我根本不在乎你雇了个骗子  杰西卡
I don't give a shit about you hiring a fraud, Jessica,

530
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,550
但他开始和瑞秋交往的时候
but you never came to me with it 

531
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,920
你没来告诉我
once he started dating rachel.

532
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,710
我怎么知道我可以信任你
How could I have known I could have trusted you

533
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,800
不会来对付我的律所
not to come after my firm?

534
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,500
罗伯特桌上的那张照片
That picture on robert's desk

535
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,290
就可以让你知道  杰西卡
is how you could have known, Jessica.

536
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,080
如果你不介意的话  我们该去剧院了
Now if you'll excuse us, we have tickets for the theater.

537
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,080
刚才很抱歉  唐娜
Sorry about before, Donna.

538
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,820
没关系  哈维  我能理解
It's okay, Harvey. I understand.

539
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,530
我在想我们处理这件事的方式不对
And I've been thinking we're going about this all wrong.

540
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,330
你是什么意思
What do you mean?

541
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,990
用法律细节上诉
I mean appealing something based on legal minutiae

542
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,830
不是你该做的
isn't what you do.

543
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,680
那我该做什么
And what exactly is it that I do?

544
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,790
你总能用交换的方式
You get people to do things they don't want to

545
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,030
让人做本不愿做的事
by giving them something else.

546
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,380
唐娜  我不能那样对付吉布斯
Donna, I can't do that with Gibbs,

547
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,360
因为她真正想抓的是我
because what she really wants is me,

548
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,820
而迈克不会让我这么做的
and Mike won't let me.

549
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,220
那如果你给她更大的东西呢
And what if you give her something bigger?

550
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,300
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

551
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,800
我是说自由铁路公司
I'm talking about Liberty Rail.

552
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,170
不行
No.

553
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,680
哈维  如果我们愿意让我为自己做的事
Harvey, if we're willing to let me be prosecuted

554
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,770
被审判  那你就可以交给吉布斯
for what I did, then you can give Gibbs

555
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,290
一个谋杀犯  并让迈克幸免于难
people who committed murder and get Mike off the hook.

556
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,780
二换一
Two for one.

557
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,380
唐娜  我不会拿你去换迈克的
Donna, I am not trading you for Mike.

558
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,360
就这样
Period.

559
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,560
那我们怎么办
Then what are we gonna do?

560
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,060
我们要把谋杀犯交给吉布斯
We're gonna give Gibbs her murderers

561
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,690
但不让会你受伤害
without giving you up at all.

562
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,570
路易  告诉我
Louis, tell me right now.

563
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,060
你向卡特里娜・班尼特承认
Did you admit to Katrina Bennett

564
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,540
你知道迈克・罗斯的事了吗
that you knew about Mike Ross?

565
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,110
道德条款
The morals clause.

566
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,960
该死的
God damn it.

567
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,150
杰西卡  她早就知道了
Jessica, she already knew.

568
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,640
她知道跟你直接承认
Her knowing and you flat-out confessing

569
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,590
不是一回事
aren't the same thing.

570
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,500
无所谓  她证明不了
It doesn't matter. She can't prove it.

571
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,300
路易  你还不明白吗
Louis, don't you get it?

572
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,050
卡特里娜・班尼特可是你教出来的
Katrina Bennett was your protégé.

573
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,630
你所有见不得人的小动作
All that underhanded shit that you do,

574
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,600
她都学会了
she learned all of it.

575
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,520
你在说什么
What are you saying?

576
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,380
我是说她录音了
I'm saying that she recorded you,

577
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,630
如果那个录音被公之于众的话
and if that tape ever sees the light of day,

578
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,810
所有合伙人只要想走
any partner who wants can walk out that door

579
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,400
就可以带着他们的客户走出那扇门
and take their clients with them.

580
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,380
不  他们走不了
No, they can't.

581
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,040
你去哪里
Where are you going?

582
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,500
档案室
To the file room.

583
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,300
你说得对  杰西卡
You're right, Jessica.

584
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,950
卡特里娜是我教出来的
Katrina was my protégé,

585
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,900
她知道我所有见不得人的事
and she knows all my dirty laundry,

586
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,510
但我也知道她的
but I also know hers.

587
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,830
我来付吧
Let me take care of it.

588
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,240
不用
I don't think so.

589
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,900
上次我们不欢而散
After the way we ended things last time,

590
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,220
至少可以替你买个单
it's the least I can do.

591
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,370
你想怎么样  哈维
What do you want, Harvey?

592
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,550
我想要自由铁路公司
I want Liberty Rail.

593
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,150
那是不可能的
Well, that's never gonna happen,

594
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,680
你需要放下这件事了
and you need to let that shit go.

595
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,830
我需要的是用这件事换迈克・罗斯的自由
What I need is to trade that shit for Mike Ross's freedom.

596
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,720
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

597
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,970
你把自由铁路公司给我
You give me Liberty Rail,

598
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,750
我会给你五个我最好的客户
I'll give you five of my best clients.

599
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,850
杰西卡・皮尔逊不会同意的
There's no way Jessica Pearson allows that to happen.

600
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,700
她说了不算
It's not her call.

601
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,690
他们是我的客户
They're my clients.

602
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,620
我不在乎
Well, I don't care,

603
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,000
因为我不会为了五个客户
because I'm not breaking privilege

604
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,570
违反保密协议  还要冒上丢饭碗的风险
and risking my entire career in exchange for five clients.

605
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,770
你想怎么样
What's it gonna take?

606
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,700
你想让我开价
You want my price?

607
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,520
我想去皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所采购一番
I want to go shopping at Pearson Specter Litt.

608
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,130
专属挑选权  雇我想雇的任何人
Exclusive access to hire anyone I want,

609
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,660
从律师助理到高级合伙人以及他们的客户
from paralegals to senior partners and their clients,

610
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,730
一个月时间
for the next month.

611
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,050
你会毁掉律所
You'd be gutting the firm.

612
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,290
你觉得我在乎吗
Do I look like I care?

613
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,390
杰西卡不可能同意
There is no way Jessica accepts this,

614
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,200
你也清楚
and you know it.

615
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,070
我只清楚  如果人够渴望
What I know is, people will do anything

616
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,520
就愿意做任何事
if they're desperate enough.

617
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,820
既然你来找我了
And if you're in here doing this,

618
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,690
那说明你很渴望救迈克・罗斯
then you're desperate to save Mike Ross.

619
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,050
迈克尔  如果你来见罗伯特
Michael, if you're here to see Robert,

620
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,810
他已经出门了
he's already gone.

621
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,900
我不是来见罗伯特的
I'm not here to see Robert.

622
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,860
我是来见你的
I'm here to see you.

623
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,010
那我希望你走
Well, I'd rather you go.

624
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,160
劳拉  拜托
Laura, please.

625
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,900
拜托什么  迈克尔
Please what, Michael?

626
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,830
罗伯特和我已经准备好接受
Robert and I were ready to embrace

627
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,640
要娶我们女儿的男人
the man who was going to marry our daughter,

628
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,660
结果那人是个骗子
and it turns out, that man is a liar.

629
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,360
你还想让我说服我丈夫
And now you're here to get me to convince my husband

630
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,230
去你的婚礼吗
to go to your wedding?

631
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,740
不只是我的婚礼
It's not just my wedding.

632
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,660
也是瑞秋的
It's also Rachel's.

633
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,520
我可以跟罗伯特谈到面色发青
And I can talk to Robert until I'm blue in the face.

634
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,920
但他绝不会原谅你
He will never forgive you.

635
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,560
他不必原谅我  好吗
He doesn't need to forgive me, all right?

636
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,230
他只用支持他的女儿
He just needs to be there for his daughter.

637
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,540
-他不会那么做的  -为什么
- He's not gonna do that. - Why not?

638
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,000
因为你在摧毁她的人生
Because you're ruining her life.

639
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,260
劳拉  我知道我犯了大错
Look, Laura, I know that I made a horrible mistake.

640
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,570
为此我要坐两年牢
I'm going away for two years,

641
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,010
而我本可以靠背叛朋友脱罪的
when I could have gotten out of it by turning in my friends.

642
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,200
瑞秋懂我是什么人
Rachel knows that's the kind of man that I am.

643
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,240
所以她才想和我共度此生
That's why she wants to spend the rest of her life with me.

644
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,640
而现在  我只求你让罗伯特看到这一点
Now all-all I am asking you is that you help Robert see that.

645
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,000
我了解我丈夫
I know my husband.

646
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,620
你的要求不可能实现
What you're asking is impossible,

647
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,500
我也不指望你明白
and I don't expect you to understand that,

648
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,060
因为你从没当过女儿的父亲
because you've never been the father of a daughter.

649
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,620
但我会尽力的
But I'll try.

650
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,920
我不懂
I don't understand.

651
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,890
你当然不懂
Of course you don't,

652
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,950
因为你也从没当过女儿的母亲
because you've also never been the mother of a daughter.

653
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,640
路易
Louis.

654
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,570
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

655
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,830
你为什么那么做
Why'd you do it?

656
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,280
做什么
Do what?

657
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,630
别给我装傻  卡特里娜
Don't be coy with me, Katrina.

658
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,170
分享律所章程是一回事
It's one thing to share our bylaws,

659
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,500
但我知道你录了我的音  我想知道原因
but I know you recorded me, and I want to know why.

660
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,720
因为我想让罗伯特・赞恩注意我
I did it because it put my name on the map with Robert Zane.

661
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,350
如果你不毁掉录音
If you don't destroy that recording,

662
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,260
我就让你被别人注意
it's gonna put your name on the map somewhere else.

663
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,370
这是你之前让我伪造的文件的复印件
This is a copy of the document I forged for you.

664
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,190
没错  你昨天提醒我的那份
Yeah, the one you reminded me of yesterday,

665
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,240
如果你不放手  我也会把这份
the same one that I'm gonna give to the SEC

666
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,790
交给证监会
if you don't back off.

667
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,740
你不必这么做
You don't have to do this.

668
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,080
你还可以来与我们同事
You can still come work with us.

669
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,750
不  我做不到  就算我想
No, I can't, and even if I wanted to,

670
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,350
我也不再相信你了
I can't trust you anymore.

671
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,550
这不公平
That's not fair.

672
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,440
这事就算不是我做  也会有人做
If it wasn't me, it would've been somebody else.

673
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,890
但的确是你  卡特里娜
But it was you, Katrina.

674
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,670
我自己的门徒背后捅我一刀
My own protégé stabbing me in the back?

675
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,440
我只想让自己有点名气
I was just trying to make a name for myself.

676
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,100
我还只是当上冠名合伙人呢
And I just wanted my name on the wall,

677
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,040
但我告诉你
but let me tell you something.

678
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,730
如果我学到了教训
If there's one thing that I have learned,

679
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,890
那就是完全不值得为了出名
it's not worth being willing to do anything

680
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,370
而不择手段
to make a name for yourself.

681
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,150
杰西卡  我得跟你谈谈
Jessica, I need to talk to you.

682
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,110
哈维  我在你提问之前告诉你
Harvey, before you ask whatever you're about to ask,

683
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,120
我没心情
I'm not in the mood.

684
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,400
那也阻止不了我
Well, that's not gonna cut it.

685
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,930
你得放弃伊凡・施密斯的竞业条款
I need you to waive our noncompetes for Evan Smith.

686
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,280
开玩笑吗
Is this a joke?

687
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,330
这是让迈克不进监狱的唯一办法
It's the only way to keep Mike out of prison.

688
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,900
没什么办法能让迈克不进监狱
There is no way to keep Mike out of prison.

689
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,180
不  有办法
Yes, there is.

690
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,220
把已经想走的人给伊凡
We give Evan people who already want to go,

691
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,600
我给安妮塔・吉布斯凶手名单交换迈克
and I give Anita Gibbs murderers in exchange for Mike.

692
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,520
我过去二十四小时
And I've just spent the last 24 hours

693
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,060
都在设法保住竞业条款
fighting to keep our noncompetes.

694
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,110
-杰西卡  -不
- Jessica. - No.

695
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,570
他为了救律所达成协议
He cut a deal to save this firm.

696
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,110
他为了不让我们进监狱达成协议
He cut a deal to keep us from going to prison,

697
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,200
你心里清楚
and you know it.

698
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,070
要知道  我根本不关心
You know, I don't give a shit

699
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,320
他达成协议时的想法
what he thought when he made that deal.

700
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,150
他本来会被判无罪
He was gonna be found innocent.

701
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,690
什么
What?

702
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,140
我去见了陪审团主席
I went to see the foreman.

703
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,990
判决本来是无罪
The verdict was gonna be not guilty.

704
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,720
那给我看你和吉布斯的协议
Then let me see your deal with Gibbs.

705
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,930
我还没拿到
I don't have it yet.

706
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,050
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

707
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,580
你让我为了协议对律所进行大屠杀
You're asking me to decimate my firm

708
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,540
而你根本不清楚她接不接受
for a deal you don't even know she'll take?

709
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,100
-我会让她接受的  -你保证不了
- I'll make her take the deal. - You don't know that.

710
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,070
我可以
Yes, I do.

711
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,430
杰西卡  我们有机会救迈克
Jessica, we have a chance to save Mike

712
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,200
让那些想走的人走
and let the people who want to go, go.

713
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,590
但如果我们输了一切还不管用呢
And what if it doesn't work and we lose everything?

714
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,710
那就这样了
Then we do.

715
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,390
杰西卡  哈维说得没错
Jessica, Harvey's right.

716
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,120
迈克是家人
Mike's family.

717
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,100
就算我们失去半个律所  但如果没尽力救他
Even if we lose half the firm, if we don't try to save him,

718
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,280
那我们是怎样的人
who are we?

719
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,490
达成协议
Make the deal.

720
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,900
-爸  -他人呢
- Da.. - Where is he?

721
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,310
他不在家
He's not here.

722
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:36,890
那太糟了
Well, that's too bad

723
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,170
因为我来跟他谈
because I came here to talk to him,

724
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,010
尽管他根本没胆跟我谈
even though he didn't have the balls to talk to me.

725
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:40,980
他有胆跟你谈
He wasn't afraid to talk to you.

726
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,470
他去找妈妈了  因为我让他这么做
He went to mom because I asked him to.

727
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,440
好吧
Oh, okay.

728
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,020
好吧  话说清楚了
Okay, let's down to this.

729
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,550
你嫁给他  他就会毁掉你的人生
You marry him, and that man ruins your life.

730
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,810
怎么会呢  爸
How, dad?

731
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,380
我们会挺过接下来两年  然后
We're gonna get through the next two years and then--

732
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,510
然后怎样
And then what?

733
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,150
因为你肯定做不成律师了
Because you're sure as shit not gonna be a lawyer.

734
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,120
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

735
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,330
我在说你的毕业问题
I'm talking about you graduating,

736
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,310
你还要去面对
and then you're gonna stand before

737
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,360
律师品格委员会审查
the character and fitness committee of the bar.

738
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,440
据我所知
And the last time I checked,

739
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,960
嫁给一个欺骗过他们的男人
marrying a man that defrauded them

740
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,740
是不会让你进入律师协会的
isn't gonna get you in.

741
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,770
好吧  但是等到那时
Okay, and by the time that happens,

742
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,890
他已经服完刑  我们就已经偿清了他的罪过
he will have served his time, and we will have paid his debt.

743
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,010
那样做到底有什么不同呢
What the hell difference does that make?

744
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:07,590
不同之处在于
The difference is 

745
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,940
我们的司法系统就是看重这个
that's what our justice system is all about,

746
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,570
而且永远支持你所爱的人
and standing behind the man that you love

747
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,960
正是品格的含义
is the definition of character and fitness.

748
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,010
很好  你对他们说这话
Okay, you tell them that,

749
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,210
他们会告诉你和你的重刑犯丈夫
and they're gonna tell you and your felon husband

750
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,810
-去见鬼吧  -那不会发生的
- to go to hell. - That's not gonna happen.

751
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,880
就是会发生  该死的
Oh, yes it is, god damn it!

752
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,260
这些都是复仇心切  保护欲强的人
These are vindictive and protective people,

753
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,610
而他又把他们当成傻子
and he make them look like fools.

754
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,620
这我不能做律师无关
This isn't about me not becoming a lawyer

755
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,570
跟他毁了我的生活也无关
or him ruining my life

756
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,720
跟你说的其他废话更无关
or any of this other bullshit that you're in here saying.

757
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,490
只是因为他欺骗了你
This is because he pulled one over on you.

758
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,260
他不能信任
He can't be trusted!

759
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,920
爸爸  很抱歉我对你隐瞒了此事
Dad, I'm sorry that I kept this from you,

760
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,370
但是他并没对我隐瞒
but he didn't keep it from me,

761
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,550
而且我告诉你我能信任他
and I'm telling you I can trust him.

762
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,940
那我如何信任你呢
And how can I trust you?

763
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,610
如果你不信任我
Well, if you can't,

764
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,330
那或许你就不应该去参加婚礼
then maybe you shouldn't come to the wedding.

765
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,520
没错  大概总结完了
Well, that about sums it up.

766
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,400
我为你感到自豪  迈克尔
I'm proud of you, Michael.

767
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,420
抑制住达成拯救自己协议的诱惑
It's not easy to resist the temptation

768
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,460
那可真不容易
to make a deal that saves yourself.

769
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,950
这个嘛  就我而言
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

770
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,280
我的确达成了拯救自己的协议
I did make a deal that saves myself.

771
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,250
但我来此并不只是为了让你感到自豪
But I didn't just come here to make you proud.

772
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,640
我是来寻求帮助
I came to ask a favor.

773
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,060
尽管说
Name it.

774
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,840
瑞秋和我想在我服刑之前结为夫妻
Rachel and I want to get married before I go.

775
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,770
我知道这通常需要
I know it's not supposed to happen

776
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,630
几个月的时间  但是
for another couple of months but--

777
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,020
但是你没有那个时间
You don't have that kind of time.

778
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,760
我保证不会太麻烦
Look, I promise it's not gonna be too much trouble.

779
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,130
我们不会邀请太多人
We're not gonna invite too many people.

780
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,780
我很荣幸  迈克尔
I'd be honored, Michael.

781
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,210
谢谢你  神父
Thank you, father.

782
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,200
迈克尔  既然你们不打算邀请很多人
Michael, since you're not inviting many people,

783
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,640
我们没必要在这里举行
we don't have to do it in here.

784
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,560
我们能在小礼堂举行
We could always do it in the small chapel.

785
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,720
我很感激  神父
I appreciate that, father,

786
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,290
但是我妈妈和爸爸不是在小礼堂举行婚礼的
But my mom and dad weren't married in the small chapel.

787
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,280
很好  你在这儿
Okay, you're here.

788
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,150
是什么如此重要
What's so important I had to

789
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,470
让我为了见你还必须重新安排传讯
reschedule an arraignment to meet with you?

790
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,470
因为那个传讯不能让你
Because that arraignment wasn't gonna lead to you

791
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,730
将一群集团谋杀犯绳之以法
putting corporate murderers behind bars.

792
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,060
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

793
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,720
你掌握了一些犯罪文件
You got a hold of some incriminating documents,

794
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,940
而且你想让我提起公诉
and you want me to prosecute these people

795
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,390
换取免去迈克・罗斯的牢狱之灾
in exchange for keeping Mike Ross out of jail.

796
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,100
谋杀罪换取欺诈罪  简单点
Murder for fraud, straight up.

797
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,270
不感兴趣
Not interested.

798
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,340
听我说
Listen to me.

799
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,260
与这些相比  迈克・罗斯犯的罪
Compared to this, what Mike Ross did

800
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,490
几乎就和路边吐痰一样轻微
barely constitutes spitting on a sidewalk.

801
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,420
我知道
I know that.

802
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,690
那你到底是怎么回事
Then what the hell is wrong with you?

803
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,220
告诉你是怎么回事
I'll tell you what's wrong with me.

804
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,310
你
You.

805
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,650
自从你出生那天起
You've been bending the rules

806
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,870
你就一直在破坏规则
since the day you were born,

807
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,630
而我不会再让你得逞
and I'm not letting you get away with it anymore.

808
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,600
你是在和我说笑吗
Are you kidding me?

809
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,540
你办这个案子  把所有规则都破坏了
You bent rules up and down this entire case.

810
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,800
但我和你之间的区别是
Except the difference between you and me is,

811
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,420
我破坏规则是为了获得正义
I'm bending them to get justice.

812
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,670
将这些人绳之以法就是正义
Putting these people away is justice.

813
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,570
那就直接把他们交给我
Then give them to me anyway.

814
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,270
没错
That's right.

815
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,710
你一直把这些案件作为自己的囊中之物
You've been keeping this case in your back pocket

816
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,560
就是为了以备不时之需
waiting for a rainy day,

817
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,660
因为你就是干那一行的
because that's what you do.

818
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,460
所以或许下一次你有机会
So maybe the next time you have a chance

819
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,490
将杀人犯绳之以法  你应该毫不留情
to put away murderers, you'll do it

820
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,130
而不是留着为了拯救某个毛头小子
instead of saving it up for a chit down the road.

821
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,840
你就那么讨厌我吗
You hate me that much?

822
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,250
我不讨厌你  但这就是你做的
I don't hate you, but you did this,

823
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,720
而且你可以想办法逃脱
and you can try to get out of it,

824
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,910
但你不能做的事情  就是否认你做过
but what you can't do anymore is deny you did it.

825
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,130
我没想逃脱此事
I'm not trying to get out of this.

826
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,560
我会代他接受处罚
I'd take the punishment for him.

827
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,930
你曾有大把的机会可以那样做
You had plenty of chances to do that,

828
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,500
但你等到来不及的时候才那样做
but you waited until it was too late.

829
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,370
现在  你想让迈克免受牢狱之灾吗
Now, you want to keep Mike out of prison?

830
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,950
你必须说服他  同意你代他受罚
You have to convince him to let you take his place.

831
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,710
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

832
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,430
哈维  我想和你谈谈
Harvey, I want to talk to you.

833
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,880
很好  因为我也想和你谈谈
Good, because I want to talk to you.

834
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,390
-我想让你做我的伴郎  -什么
- I want you to be my best man. - What?

835
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,310
瑞秋和我想结婚
Rachel and I want to get married.

836
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,350
你离进监狱都不到一天了
You're less than a day from prison,

837
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,500
但你还想着婚纱和鲜花吗
and you're thinking about dresses and flowers?

838
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,810
-哈维  -你知道吗
- Harvey-- - You know what?

839
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,050
我做你伴郎有一个条件
I'll be your best man on one condition.

840
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,840
-为时已晚  -才没有
- That ship has sailed. - The hell it has.

841
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,800
我们还可以给吉布斯打电话
We can still call Gibbs.

842
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,760
我不会给吉布斯打电话
I am not calling Gibbs.

843
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,990
你用脑子想想
Get it through your head.

844
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,920
这件事该由我承担
This is on me.

845
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,150
不  你用脑子想想
No, you get it through your head.

846
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,030
我不会让你进监狱
I am not letting you go to prison

847
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,320
因为我犯下的罪责
for a crime that I committed.

848
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,550
我不会让你去坐牢
Well, I'm not letting you go

849
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,520
而你的判决本会是无罪
when you were gonna be found innocent.

850
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,860
你刚说什么
What did you say?

851
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,060
没错  我撒谎了
That's right, I lied.

852
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,370
陪审团的裁定是无罪
The verdict was not guilty.

853
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,040
-不  我不相信你  -那给那个人打电话
- No, I don't believe you. - Then call the goddamn guy.

854
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,190
你究竟为何要骗我
Why the hell would you lie to me?

855
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,450
因为真相会击垮你
Because the truth would have broken you.

856
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,860
那你现在想击垮我了
Oh, except now you want to break me?

857
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,890
因为这是唯一让你同意我的办法
Because it's the only way you're gonna let me do this.

858
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,720
你认为给瑞秋带上戒指
You think putting a ring on Rachel's finger

859
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,880
就会让这一切烟消云散吗
is gonna make everything go away?

860
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,520
你知道吗  哈维
You know what, Harvey?

861
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,600
你如果想参加我的婚礼  告诉我
You want to come to my wedding, you let me know.

862
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,200
你想进监狱吗
You want to go to prison?

863
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,730
首要规则  永远不要背对着任何人
Rule number one: Never turn your back on anyone.

864
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,630
我知道你要干嘛  但没有用
I know what you're doing, and it's not gonna work.

865
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,350
我不会试图取代你的位置
I'm not trying to take your place anymore.

866
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,170
我要让你做好准备
I'm trying to get you ready

867
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,900
就像格洛丽亚・丹纳要求我那样
like Gloria Danner asked me to.

868
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,680
-哈维  -因为你很弱
- Harvey-- - Because you're weak.

869
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,860
我不弱
I am not weak.

870
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,340
-那好  打我啊  -不
- Yeah, well, hit me. - No.

871
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,340
-打我  -哈维  住手
- Hit me. - Harvey, stop it.

872
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,260
-听着  -不  你听我说
- Listen. - No, you listen to me.

873
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,950
-你认为你不弱吗  -你这样做
- You think you're not weak? - You're only doing this

874
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,510
-只是因为你感到愧疚  -路易・利特
- because you feel guilty, all right? - Louis Litt 

875
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,370
-把你夹在腋下  -但是我不会
- got you in a headlock. - But I am not gonna

876
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,810
-就这样打你  -苔丝的丈夫揍了你一顿
-hit you just because... - Tess's husband kicked your ass.

877
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,670
你接受不了这个事实
You can't handle the fact--

878
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,790
洛根・桑德斯勾引瑞秋
Logan Sanders hooked up with Rachel.

879
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,470
-立马住嘴  -一旦你进去
- Stop right now. - What do you think he's gonna

880
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,170
你觉得他会干什么...
do with her the second you get...

881
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,640
这就是你想要的吗  想要我恨你
Is that what you want? That I hate you,

882
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,930
想要我对你这样做吗
and that you made me do this?

883
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,140
我会因为你而失去一切
I'm gonna lose everything because of you!

884
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,130
迈克  拜托
Mike, please.

885
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,180
我们给吉布斯打电话
Let's call Gibbs.

886
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,450
我做不到
I can't.

887
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:46,870
我做不到  哈维
I can't, Harvey.

888
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,380
做不到
I can't.

889
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,790
干什么呢
What are you doing?

890
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,660
有时候我就是喜欢来看看
Sometimes I like to come and just watch.

891
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,090
看看你的成就吗
See how far you've come?

892
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,120
差不多吧
Oh, something like that.

893
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,110
吉布斯没有接受协议  杰西卡
Gibbs didn't take the deal, Jessica.

894
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,710
对不起  是我错了
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

895
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,010
不  路易  你没错
No, Louis, you were right.

896
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,630
他是家人  我们应该努力的
He's family, and we had to try.

897
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,470
不管谁离开
And whoever's left,

898
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,200
我们都会更强
we'll be stronger,

899
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,540
即使我们变小了
even if we're smaller.

900
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,620
对不起  迈克
I'm sorry, Mike.

901
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,060
我不该告诉你判决的真相
I shouldn't have told you the truth about the verdict.

902
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,030
我不该打你那么多下
I probably shouldn't have hit you all those times.

903
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:46,970
没关系
It's okay.

904
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,160
知道你还有点血性  让我感觉好很多
Makes me feel better knowing you have it in you.

905
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,240
我得走了
I got to go.

906
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,810
我得去求瑞秋嫁给我
I got to ask Rachel to marry me.

907
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,820
你们不是就要结婚了吗
I thought you were already getting married.

908
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,860
还有些事我得先告诉她
There's something I got to tell her first.

909
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,580
你是来幸灾乐祸的吗
You come here to gloat?

910
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,270
今晚不太合适
Because tonight is not the night.

911
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,280
不  罗伯特
No, Robert.

912
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,070
我是来讲和的
I came here to make peace.

913
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,740
你是对的
You were right.

914
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,180
我该来告诉你  我很抱歉我没有
I should have come to you, and I'm sorry I didn't,

915
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,550
而我余生都会为此后悔
and I will regret that for the rest of my life.

916
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,730
但我听说瑞秋明天要结婚
But I understand Rachel is getting married tomorrow,

917
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,240
我要告诉你  如果你不去
and I'm telling you, if you're not there for her,

918
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,210
你余生都会为此而后悔
you will regret it for the rest of yours.

919
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,140
瑞秋
Rachel?

920
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,380
我在卧室
I'm in the bedroom.

921
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,630
别进来
Don't come in.

922
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:03,950
为什么  怎么了
Why? What's wrong?

923
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,830
不  没事
No, nothing's wrong.

924
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,700
我在试婚纱
I-I have my dress on.

925
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,750
瑞秋  拜托
Rachel, come on, please.

926
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,780
婚礼会有无数的事情
There are about a million things with this wedding

927
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,690
进行得不尽如人愿
that aren't going as planned,

928
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,350
我都能接受
and I'm fine with that,

929
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,230
但我不要让你看到我穿婚纱的样子
But I'm not gonna jinx it by having you 

930
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,360
而毁掉婚礼
see me in my dress.

931
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,300
瑞秋  判决的事我说错了
Rachel, I was wrong about the verdict.

932
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,650
哈维对我说了谎
Harvey lied to me.

933
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,440
他们准备判我无罪的
They were gonna find me not guilty.

934
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,630
瑞秋  求你开门
Rachel, please open the door.

935
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,460
你为什么要现在告诉我
Why are you telling me this right now?

936
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,220
因为你是在知道我会被判有罪后
Because you only wanted to get married

937
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,020
才愿意结婚的
after you found out I was guilty,

938
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,690
而我不想让我们共同生活的开始
and I didn't want to start our life out

939
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,040
基于另一个谎言
with another secret.

940
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,290
你是对的
You were right.

941
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,930
我应该对自己有信心
I should have had faith in myself,

942
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,950
但我没有
and I didn't.

943
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,400
如果你不想结婚了
If you don't want to do this now,

944
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,030
我也理解
I understand.

945
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,550
我们可以在我出来之后结婚
We can do it when I get out.

946
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,080
在我想象中  你就在外面
In my mind, you are out,

947
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,300
没人知道
And no one knows what's gonna happen

948
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,980
婚后会发生什么
after they get married.

949
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,960
他们只知道
They just know what's gonna happen

950
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,530
他们结婚那天会发生什么
the day that they do.

951
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,960
而我们结婚的日子就是明天
And the day we're getting married is tomorrow.

952
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,600
我从没见过更漂亮的新娘子
I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful bride.

953
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,040
那太好了  因为我也没见过
That's good, because I have never seen

954
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,430
更漂亮的伴娘
a more beautiful maid of honor.

955
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:41,990
我不想打扰你
So I don't want to bother you,

956
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,110
但我就是想进来
but I just wanted to come in and give you a little bit

957
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,660
提前给你个结婚礼物
of an early wedding present.

958
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,040
唐娜  你不用这样的
Donna, you don't have to do that.

959
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,520
你爸爸妈妈来了
Your mom and dad are here.

960
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,040
谢谢你
Thank you.

961
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,760
别谢我  谢杰西卡
Oh, don't thank me. Thank Jessica.

962
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:02,110
我先去戴项链了
Um...I'm gonna go and put my necklace on

963
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,340
以免我把眼妆哭花
before I make my mascara run.

964
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,350
好  我在外面等你
Okay, I'll just be outside.

965
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,140
不  等等  我希望
No, no, please, I would, um...

966
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,670
我希望你陪着我
I'd rather you stay.

967
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,380
好
Okay.

968
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,420
唐娜  我能跟瑞秋说句话吗
Donna, can I talk to rachel for a second?

969
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,080
迈克  不行
Mike, you can't.

970
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,850
你在婚礼前不能见她
You can't see her before the ceremony.

971
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,050
唐娜  拜托
Donna, please.

972
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,050
唐娜  能不能帮我把...
Okay, Donna, can you just help me put--

973
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,490
迈克  你不能见到我穿婚纱的样子
Mike, you can't see me in my dress.

974
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,820
瑞秋  我们不能结婚
Rachel, we can't do this.

975
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,830
什么
What?

976
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,000
我来的时候看到了你父母
I just walked in and I saw your parents.

977
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,630
他们是不得不来的
They're here because they have to be,

978
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,160
不是因为他们想来
not because they want to be.

979
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,910
迈克
Mike--

980
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,860
不只是你爸爸的表情
It wasn't just the look on your father's face.

981
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,840
还有你妈妈的
It's the look on your mother's.

982
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,330
他们觉得我在夺走你的未来
They think I'm taking away your future.

983
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,750
你就是我的未来
You are my future.

984
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,710
我不是说我不想结婚
I am not saying that I don't want to get married.

985
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,190
我只是说如果有什么事导致
I'm just saying that if for some reason

986
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,910
我成了夺走你梦想的原因
I was responsible for taking away your dream...

987
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,070
你会永远无法原谅你自己
That you'd never be able to live with yourself.

988
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,480
你去读完法学院  好吗
You go finish law school, okay?

989
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,520
通过律师资格考试  成为律师
And you pass the bar, and you become a lawyer,

990
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,100
然后  两年后我出来
And then...in two years when I get out,

991
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,750
如果你还想嫁给我
if you still want to marry me...

992
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,810
我会的
Oh, I will.

993
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,650
我当然会的
Of course I will.

994
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:29,830
你怎么知道呢
How'd you know?

995
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,770
我就是知道  而且我不可能
I knew, and there's no way

996
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,400
让你独自去
I'm letting you do this alone.

997
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:13,900
都走了
They're all gone.

998
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,860
{\an8}联邦监狱

999
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:31,810
这不是你的错  哈维
It's not your fault, Harvey.

1000
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:33,980
是我自己做的
I made my case.

1001
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,090
我说服你雇了我
I convinced you to hire me.

1002
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,780
是我做的决定
I was the one that made the call.

1003
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:41,950
没错
You were.

1004
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,160
但那不重要
But it doesn't matter.

1005
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,730
因为就算我知道结果
'Cause even knowing how it all turned out...

1006
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,990
我也还会再来一次
I'd do it again.

1007
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,150
我猜我也会
I guess I would too,

1008
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,710
因为我从来没有想过
'cause I never thought in a million years

1009
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,010
我会认识哪个人
I'd meet someone dumb enough

1010
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,160
傻到会为我进监狱
to be willing to go to prison for me.

1011
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,190
唐娜总是说
I mean, Donna always said

1012
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,280
你在找另一个你
you were looking for another you.

1013
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,680
我想你找到了
I guess you found one.

1014
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,470
我想是该努力地
I guess it's time to get busy living

1015
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,160
忙着生  或赶着死了[《肖申克救赎》]
and get busy dying.

1016
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,710
说得一点都没错
Well, that's goddamn right.

1017
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,350
在里面多加小心  迈克
Watch your back in there, Mike.

1018
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:44,860
我会的
I will.
