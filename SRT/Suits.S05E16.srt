{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on Suits...

68
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,630
监狱毁了克利福德的一生
Prison ruined Clifford's life.

69
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,100
如果你是我们的律师
And if you had been our lawyer,

70
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,600
他根本不会被判有罪
he never would have been convicted in the first place.

71
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,590
你想怎样
What do you want?

72
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,960
你坐两年牢
You do two years in prison,

73
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,340
我就放过你的朋友们
and I won't go after any of your friends.

74
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,100
这是唯一有把握的让事情归于平息方法
It's the only sure way to put this to bed

75
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,540
并能保证
and make sure that the only person

76
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,050
受损失的只有我一人
who is hurt by it is me.

77
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,970
那我呢
What about me?

78
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,760
我也只是爱你啊
All I did was love you.

79
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,960
我不会出卖他们的
I'm not gonna rat them out.

80
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,170
我不是劝你出卖他们
I'm not asking you to.

81
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,240
我只是希望你能对自己多点信心
I'm just asking you to have faith in yourself.

82
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,480
别再自愿承担后果了
Don't fall on your sword again.

83
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,240
我们可能赢不了
We might not win.

84
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,730
你不需要永远都做英雄
You don't always have to be the hero.

85
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,480
我那么做不是为了当英雄
I'm not doing it to be the hero.

86
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,970
那你为了什么
Then why the hell are you doing it?

87
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,390
我绝不会把朋友送进监狱的
I would never send my friends to prison.

88
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,240
如果他们给我定罪
They find me guilty,

89
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,340
也一样会送我朋友进监狱
they're gonna send my friends to prison anyways.

90
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,380
陪审团出来了  我们有一小时时间
The jury came back. We have an hour.

91
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,370
迈克呢
Where's Mike?

92
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,420
我不知道
I don't know.

93
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,740
我准备好接受协议了
I'm ready to take your deal.

94
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,940
哪个协议
Which one?

95
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,290
我们说清楚
So just to be clear,

96
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,110
你要的是这一份
this is the one you want to go with.

97
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,040
你入狱两年  你的朋友们不受指控
You go to prison for two years, your friends go free,

98
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,870
定下之后不得反悔
and no crying about it once it's done.

99
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,020
加一条
One stipulation.

100
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,950
我不会给你减刑的
I'm not reducing your jail time by one minute.

101
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,020
不是这个
That's not it.

102
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,550
我要你写清楚  我们签字后
I want you to write in that once we sign,

103
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,180
你不能再跟哈维重新定协议
you can't renegotiate with Harvey.

104
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,730
我知道了
Oh, I get it.

105
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,300
你是担心我会用这个
You're afraid I'm gonna use this

106
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,740
让他替你挡子弹
to get him to take the bullet for you.

107
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,110
我不是怕你会那么做
I'm not afraid of you trying to do that,

108
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,460
我知道你会那么做
because I know you will.

109
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,510
要么你写进去  要么我们等判决
So, either put it in, or we go to verdict.

110
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,160
记住  就像你对我说的
And just remember, like you said to me,

111
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,580
时间不多了
tick tock.

112
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,460
你做了什么
What did you do?

113
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,980
我必须做的
I did what I had to do.

114
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,680
我认罪了
I pled guilty.

115
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,170
胡扯
Bullshit.

116
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,740
你没认罪
You didn't plead anything.

117
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,760
哈维  看着我
Harvey, look at me.

118
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,820
是我犯了罪
It was my crime.

119
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,960
这是我的决定
It was my choice to make,

120
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,820
我做了决定
and I made it.

121
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,360
已经结束了
It's done.

122
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,450
我要推翻
Well, I'm gonna unmake it,

123
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,010
法官还没批准呢
because the judge hasn't ratified it yet,

124
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,020
在此之前  什么都没结束
and until she does, nothing is done.

125
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,020
哈维  停下
Harvey, stop.

126
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,120
不  你听我说
No, you listen to me.

127
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,760
如果你以为我会让你这么做
If you think I'm gonna let you do this,

128
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,580
你就是疯了
you're out of your goddamn mind.

129
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,340
做什么  迈克
Do what, Mike?

130
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,890
你做了什么
What did you do?

131
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,790
我接受了两年的协议
I took the two years.

132
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,250
-不  不会的  -瑞秋  求你
- No, no, you didn't. - Rachel, Rachel, please.

133
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,650
-我不接受  -听我说
- I don't accept that. - Please listen.

134
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,790
只有这样我才能...
It was the only way that I could--

135
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,710
不  不是只有这条路
No, it wasn't the only way.

136
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,080
你说你会等待判决的
You told me that you'd wait for the verdict,

137
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,070
我求你要相信自己
and I begged you to have faith in yourself,

138
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,880
你也说你会的
and you told me that you would.

139
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,780
那是在我求迪亚兹接受一个
That was before I begged Diaz to take a deal

140
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,810
出卖朋友的协议之前
that would rat out his friend,

141
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,640
他没听我说
and he didn't listen to me--

142
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,780
等等  你要放弃
Wait a second. You're throwing away

143
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,660
我们接下来的两年生活
the next two years of our lives

144
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,540
就因为个罪犯的话
for something that some criminal said?

145
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,270
-停下  听我说  -等等
- Just stop. Listen to me. - Hold on.

146
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,990
哈维说他不会允许这事发生
Harvey said he wasn't gonna let this happen.

147
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,340
他去见法官了  是吧
He went to see the judge, didn't he?

148
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,170
无所谓  他阻止不了
It doesn't matter. He can't stop it.

149
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,880
-为什么  -因为这事不在他
- Why not? - Because it's not up to him.

150
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,060
在我  我已经决定了
It's up to me, and I've made my decision.

151
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,280
瑞秋  你去哪
Rachel, where are you going?

152
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,720
哪儿都行
Anywhere else.

153
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,670
如果你要夺走
Because if you're gonna rob us

154
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,800
我们接下来两年的生活
of the next two years of our lives,

155
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,410
我不会站在这儿看着你那么做
I am not gonna stand here and watch you do it.

156
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,310
吉布斯女士  我不喜欢等人
Ms. Gibbs, I don't appreciate being kept waiting

157
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,470
尤其陪审团已经达成判决了
once the jury has informed us they've reached a verdict.

158
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,220
抱歉  法官大人
I'm sorry, your honor.

159
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,810
罗斯先生和我刚刚在完成一份认罪协议
Mr. Ross and I were finalizing a plea agreement.

160
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,180
我也抱歉  法官大人
I'm sorry too, your honor,

161
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,150
但他们狗屁都没完成
but they haven't finalized shit.

162
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,950
你刚刚在我的法庭上说了什么
What did you just say in my courtroom?

163
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,150
您没听错
You heard what I said.

164
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,200
立刻去我办公室
My chambers, right now.

165
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,820
瑞秋  我听说陪审团出来了
Rachel, I heard the jury is back.

166
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,950
我来听判决的
I came down to hear the verdict.

167
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,850
不会有判决了
There's not gonna be a verdict,

168
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,930
你掉头回去吧
so you can turn right around,

169
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,010
迈克认了罪  要去蹲两年监狱了
because Mike took a deal to spend two years in prison.

170
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,240
天呐
Oh, my god.

171
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,380
他们正在里面
And they're in there right now

172
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,430
签字呢
signing off on it.

173
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,900
我不知道该怎么办
And I don't know what to do.

174
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,300
好吧  我告诉你你该干什么
Okay, I'll tell you what you need to do.

175
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,530
你得回去
You need to go back inside,

176
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,030
陪在他身边
and you need to be there for him.

177
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,940
我才不要
I'm not gonna go back inside and be there for him.

178
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,450
为什么
Why not?

179
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,700
因为他告诉我他不会这么做
Because he told me that he wasn't going to do this.

180
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,980
他说有这个协议
He told me that it was on the table,

181
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,270
我求他不要接受
and I begged him not to take it,

182
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,150
他答应他不会的
and he promised me that he wouldn't.

183
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,050
瑞秋  哈维昨晚来找我
Rachel, last night Harvey came to me

184
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,980
也想这么做
wanting to do the same thing,

185
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,020
我求他要相信陪审团的
and I begged him to have faith in that jury.

186
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,250
哈维守了诺言
And Harvey kept his word.

187
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,580
但他也可能打破的
But he might not have,

188
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,640
我告诉自己  即便他改了主意
and I told myself that if he changed his mind,

189
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,240
我也必须原谅他
I would have to forgive him.

190
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,410
唐娜  你是个比我好的人
Then Donna, you're a better woman than I am,

191
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,730
因为迈克就是我的心
because Mike is my heart,

192
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,100
现在我感觉好像有人把我的心
and right now I feel like someone is ripping my heart

193
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,120
从胸膛里扯了出来  而那个人
out of my chest, and that someone--

194
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,700
就是他
that someone's him.

195
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,770
法官大人  我才不在乎那份协议
Your Honor, I don't give a shit about that deal.

196
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,380
她占了我的委托人的便宜
She took advantage of my client.

197
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,050
她强迫了他  您有权力阻止她
She coerced him, and you have the power to stop it.

198
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,700
我受够了你的粗口  斯佩克特先生
I've had enough of your language, Mr. Specter.

199
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,900
并非强迫
It wasn't coercion.

200
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,940
是一位有能力的律师商定的
It was negotiated by a competent attorney.

201
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,180
毫无问题  你也没有阻止它的依据
It's rock solid, and there's no basis to stop it.

202
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,190
他不是位有能力的律师
He's not a competent attorney.

203
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,100
他要承认诈骗罪签订协议呢
He's cutting a deal to plead guilty to fraud.

204
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,560
你想跟我签订另一种协议  我乐意听听
You want to cut a different deal with me? I'm all ears.

205
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,880
但问题是
Yeah, the only problem with that

206
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,140
你不能签别的协议了
is you can't sign a different deal,

207
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,640
因为你已经签字放弃这一权利了
because you already signed your rights to that away.

208
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,820
该死的  迈克  别这么做
God damn it, Mike, don't do this.

209
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,350
我们可以等判决
We can go to verdict.

210
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,290
别跟我来那套
Don't give me that.

211
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,720
你冲去她的办公室
You weren't racing over to her office

212
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,700
不是为了告诉她陪审团回来了
to tell her that the jury was back.

213
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,700
你是想跳过去盖住手雷
You were going to jump on the grenade,

214
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,600
而我先你一步
and I beat you to it.

215
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,280
我说了  结束了  已经结束了
Now I told you it's done, and it's done.

216
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,720
你十分确定吗  罗斯先生
Are you absolutely sure, Mr. Ross?

217
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,390
是的  法官大人
I am, Your Honor.

218
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,610
那么  罗斯先生  给你72小时
Then, Mr. Ross, you have 72 hours

219
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,050
去丹伯里联邦监狱报到
to report to Danbury Federal Prison.

220
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,800
直接告诉我结果
Give it to me straight.

221
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,420
什么情况
What happened?

222
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,520
迈克认罪了  作为交换
Mike pled guilty, and in exchange,

223
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,410
他们不能再动你  哈维  路易  我们任何人
they can't go after you, Harvey, Louis, or any of us.

224
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,550
该死
Shit.

225
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,030
作为刚刚得知
For someone who just found out

226
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,310
自己不会进监狱的人来说  你怎么不高兴呢
she's not going to prison, you don't seem happy.

227
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,680
我担心的从来不是进监狱  唐娜
I was never worried about going to prison, Donna.

228
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,320
那你担心什么
What are you worried about?

229
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,730
失去我的公司
Losing my firm.

230
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,300
迈克认了罪  他经手过的每一桩案子
Now that Mike pled guilty, every case he ever touched

231
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,070
都将变成"官司"
has "lawsuit" written all over it.

232
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,350
那我们要怎么办
So what are we gonna do?

233
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,960
我告诉你我们要怎么办
I'll tell you what we're going to do.

234
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,440
我们要重组这家律所
We're gonna restructure this firm,

235
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,900
而且我们得在官司打起来前就重组
and we're gonna do it before the lawsuits even start.

236
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,540
把路易叫来
Get me Louis.

237
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,940
迈克
Michael.

238
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,200
格洛丽亚  你在这里干什么
Gloria, what are you doing here?

239
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,030
我过来陪你听判决的
I came here to be with you for the verdict,

240
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,840
但他们告诉我你达成了协议
but they told me you made a deal.

241
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,530
的确
I did.

242
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,000
迈克  主怎么能让我看着两个
Michael, there's no way the lord would have

243
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,120
无辜的人去坐牢啊
put me through two innocent men going away.

244
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,330
但是丹纳女士  我并不无辜
But Mrs. Danner, I'm not innocent,

245
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,660
我确实做了他们所控诉我的那些事
and I did what they accused me of.

246
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,370
我又不傻  迈克
I'm not stupid, Michael.

247
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,160
我不是指你上过法学院
I didn't mean you went to law school.

248
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,410
我指的是你的内心是清白的
I meant you are innocent in your heart,

249
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,410
而如今你却选择去一个
and now you've chosen to go to a place

250
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,090
满是内心不清白的人的地方
filled with men who aren't.

251
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,230
我想您是没搞清楚
I don't think you understand.

252
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,570
我要去的是一个白领监狱
I'm going to a white-collar prison.

253
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,770
一旦大门一关  可就没什么
There's no such thing as a white-collar prison

254
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,700
白领监狱一说了
once they close those doors.

255
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,820
你得听我的
You need to hear me.

256
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,530
格洛丽亚  听着  我知道你是想帮我
Gloria, look, I know that you are trying to help,

257
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,400
但我是为了自己的所为承担责任
but I took responsibility for what I did,

258
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
我将要忍受这一点
and I'm gonna live with it.

259
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,620
但如今  我得去和我爱的女人待在一起
But right now, I need to go spend time with the woman I love

260
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,500
并且把事情处理好
and make things right,

261
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,700
所以很抱歉  容我先行一步
so I'm sorry, but you have to excuse me.

262
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,530
罗伯特  我收到你的信息了
Robert, I got your message.

263
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,190
然后马上赶了过来
I rushed right over.

264
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,130
瑞秋怎么了
What happened to Rachel?

265
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,360
我告诉你她怎么了
I'll tell you what happened.

266
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,520
迈克・罗斯要进监狱了
Mike Ross is going to jail,

267
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,530
我的女儿心都碎了
my daughter is heartbroken,

268
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,750
但哈维和杰西卡却毫发无伤地脱罪了
and Harvey and Jessica are getting off scot-free.

269
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,360
等等  假如你把我引下来
Wait a second. If you lured me down here

270
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,620
只是因为想找个出气筒
because you wanted a punching bag,

271
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,060
我可以告诉你  那种事不可能发生
I can tell you right now, that's not gonna happen.

272
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,880
我来告诉你会发生什么
Well, let me tell you what is gonna happen.

273
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,140
马上  迈克用他那毫无意义的名声所
It's about to be open season on every case

274
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,640
担保的每一桩案子  都要开始重审了
that Mike Ross ever put his good-for-nothing name on,

275
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,940
一旦开始了
and once that happens,

276
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,130
或早或晚
it's just a matter of time

277
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,700
你手下每一个律师都会试图跳槽了
until every one of your attorneys tries to leave.

278
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,760
我明白这是怎么回事了
I see what this is.

279
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,680
你想利用我来引发一场
You want to use me to start an avalanche

280
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,330
会活埋了哈维和杰西卡的雪崩
that will bury Harvey and Jessica.

281
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,950
你猜怎么着
Guess what?

282
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,900
我不会干这种事的
I'm not gonna do it.

283
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,480
那你就是比我想象中还要蠢了
Then you're a bigger fool than I thought,

284
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,080
因为我会找到一个愿意做的人
because I'm gonna find someone that will.

285
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,950
祝你好运  因为我们有非竞争条款
Good luck with that, because we have a noncompete.

286
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,070
不是人人都有  你就没有
Not anymore, you don't.

287
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,090
放屁  你是在虚张声势
Bullshit. You're bluffing.

288
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,440
你何不去问问你的前助理卡特里娜
Then why don't you go and ask your ex-associate Katrina?

289
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,630
因为一开始就是她给我提供的
Because she's the one that gave me

290
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,460
这个规避规则的办法
the way around it in the first place.

291
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,320
哈维  我听说了迈克的事了
Harvey, I heard about Mike.

292
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,340
真是太可惜了
I am so sorry.

293
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,570
别可惜了
Well, you can stop being sorry

294
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,340
给我搞到那个陪审团主席的名字
and get me the name of that jury foreman.

295
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,900
哈维  你申请不到无效审判的
Harvey, you can't get a mistrial.

296
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,260
已经太迟了  迈克已经达成协议了
It's too late. Mike cut a deal.

297
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,080
我不需要法律建议  唐娜
I don't need legal advice, Donna.

298
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,260
我只需要那个主席的姓名和住址
I need the name and address of that foreman.

299
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,400
我不认为那是个好主意
I don't think that's a good idea.

300
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,180
又不是要犯法  唐娜
It's not breaking the law anymore, Donna.

301
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,190
只是叫你帮个忙
It's just a favor.

302
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,320
我又不会毁了他的生活
I'm not gonna ruin his life.

303
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,980
我只需要问他一个该死的问题
I just need to ask him a goddamn question.

304
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,610
在你告诉我那个问题是什么之前
Well, I'm not gonna do that until you tell me

305
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,860
我是不会帮你的
what that question is.

306
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,950
唐娜...
Donna...

307
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,670
迈克刚刚抛弃了自己的整个人生
Mike just threw his whole life away,

308
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,370
而我却对此无能为力
and there's nothing I can do about it,

309
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,340
唯一能让我接受这一点的方式
and the only way that I can accept it

310
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,750
就是我去问清楚原本的判决是什么
is if I find out what that verdict was gonna be.

311
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,290
我帮你去搞到名字
I'll get you the name.

312
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,220
罗伯特・赞恩刚刚告诉我
Robert Zane just told me

313
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,340
他能解除我们的非竞争条款
he can take away our noncompete.

314
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,610
我要你立马告诉我他要如何做到这一点
I need you to tell me right now how he's gonna do that.

315
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,120
很高兴见到你  路易
Nice to see you too, Louis.

316
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,440
我能给你来杯李子泥吗
Can I offer you a prunie?

317
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,390
不  我不要什么该死的李子泥
No, I don't need a damn prunie.

318
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,920
我需要你告诉我他在打什么主意
I need you to tell me what he's up to.

319
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,460
路易  我如今人在这里
Louis, I'm here now,

320
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,250
而我之所以在这里
and the reason I'm here

321
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,490
是因为我因帮你而被开除了
is that I got fired for helping you,

322
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,460
而且即便你保证过在你成为冠名合伙人后
and even though you promised to bring me back

323
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,890
就让我回去
once you were named partner,

324
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,220
但你失约了
you didn't.

325
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,290
不不不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

326
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,260
我想让你回来  卡特里娜  非常想
I wanted to bring you back, Katrina, more than anything.

327
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,300
别和我来这一套  路易
Don't give me that, Louis.

328
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,040
在希拉甩了你之后我为你打掩护
I covered for you after Sheila dumped you.

329
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,830
我帮你挖到了回春制药
I helped you poach Versalife.

330
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,780
我甚至帮你伪造了政府文件
I even forged government documents for you.

331
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,080
好吧  卡特里娜  我想要让你回来
Okay, Katrina, I wanted to bring you back,

332
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,270
但我没办法保护你不受...
I couldn't protect you--

333
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,490
不受什么
From what?

334
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,910
不受发现迈克・罗斯是骗子这个真相的伤害吗
From finding out Mike Ross is a fraud?

335
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,090
没错  我算过了  路易
Yeah, I did the math, Louis,

336
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,740
你没办法保护我不受这件事的伤害
and you couldn't have protected me from it,

337
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,550
却可以利用这点让自己当上冠名合伙人
but you could use it to get your name on the door,

338
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,620
是不是
couldn't you?

339
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,690
你要看着我的眼睛告诉我事实并非如此吗
Are you gonna look me in the eye and tell me that isn't true?

340
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,390
事实就是如此
It's true.

341
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,390
我感激你的坦诚
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

342
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,390
既然你对我坦诚  我也会对你坦诚
Since you were honest with me, I'll be honest with you.

343
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,060
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

344
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,300
你还好吧
Are you okay?

345
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,530
不好
No.

346
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,590
瑞秋...
Rachel...

347
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,800
我就不明白了  迈克
I just don't understand, Mike.

348
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,230
你告诉过我你会等判决出来的
You told me you'd wait for the verdict.

349
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,320
我知道
I know.

350
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,810
瑞秋  听我说  好吗
Rachel, listen to me, all right?

351
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,230
我这么做不是想伤害你
I didn't do this to hurt you.

352
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,080
我这么做是因为我本性如此
I did it because it's who I am.

353
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,840
我明白
I know that.

354
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,550
那你为什么还要怪我呢
Then why are you holding it against me?

355
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,280
因为一想到要失去你我就无法忍受
Because I can't stand the thought of losing you.

356
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,100
你不会失去我的
You're not gonna lose me.

357
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,190
不  我会的  迈克  要失去两年
Yes, I am, Mike, for two years.

358
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,210
本来可能是七年呢
And it could have been seven.

359
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,870
-也可能是无罪  -他们...
- It could have been zero. - They took--

360
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,690
你为什么就不能等到判决出来呢
Why couldn't you just wait for the verdict?

361
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,040
因为我只求下半辈子
Because I have to live with myself

362
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,430
过得心安理得
for the rest of my life.

363
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,390
我做出了决定  而我...
I made a decision, and I...

364
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,190
我没办法回到过去改变主意了
I can't go back in time and change it.

365
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,320
但如今我们在这里呢
But we are here right now, all right?

366
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,110
我们还有三天时间
We have--we have three days left.

367
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,890
我得抽出一天独自待着
I'm gonna have to take one of those days for myself...

368
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,050
因为你向我保证过你会对自己有信心的
because you promised me that you would have faith in yourself.

369
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,510
但你失约了
And you didn't.

370
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,060
记得我吗
You remember me?

371
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,020
怎么可能不记得
How could I not?

372
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,530
我听你说话听了快两周的时间
I listened to you for the better part of two weeks.

373
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,890
那我就直说了
Then I'll get right to it.

374
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,140
我需要你帮我个忙
I need a favor.

375
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,360
你有卡车要修吗
You got a truck needs fixing?

376
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,580
我想知道最终的判决是什么
I want to know what that verdict was gonna be.

377
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,780
你不想
No, you don't.

378
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,830
是的  我想
Yeah, I do.

379
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,280
知道了又有什么不同呢
What difference does it make?

380
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,330
那将大有不同
It makes all the difference in the world.

381
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,240
那我就告诉你
Then I'll tell you,

382
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,950
因为我非常想告诉别人
'cause I've been dying to tell somebody,

383
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,430
因为我们就像《十二怒汉》一样
'cause it was "12 angry men" in there,

385
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,680
而我就是那一个异类
And I was the one.

386
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,460
是的
Yeah, that's right.

387
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,340
我一个又一个的将他们争取过来
One by one, I put that jury on my back

388
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,880
然后做了正确的决定
and we did the right thing.

389
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,160
什么是正确的决定
What's the right thing?

390
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,510
你以为我不知道真相吗
You think I don't know what's what?

391
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,050
那个孩子并没有读过法学院
That kid didn't go to law school.

392
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,840
你知  我知
You know it, I know it,

393
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,970
那个屋子里的所有人都知道
everybody in the goddamn room knew it.

394
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,140
是有罪
It was guilty.

395
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,270
我没那么说
I didn't say that.

396
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,150
那个女人的案子站不住脚
That woman didn't make her case,

397
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,110
我也不会让我的国家的司法体制
and I'm not letting my country's justice system

398
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,710
在我的手上沾上污点
go to shit on my watch.

399
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,220
说吧
Say it.

400
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,100
无罪
Not guilty.

401
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,500
他们说你们达成了某种协议
They told us you guys cut some kind of deal.

402
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,760
你们应该对体制多点信心的
Guess you should have had a little more faith in the system.

403
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,660
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter?

404
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,480
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter.

405
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,010
丹纳女士  您有什么事
Mrs. Danner, what can I do for you?

406
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,360
我试图说服迈克  但他不听
I tried to talk to Michael, but he wouldn't listen.

407
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,270
说服他什么
Talk to him about what?

408
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,260
告诉他监狱里面是什么样子
About what's gonna happen to him inside that prison.

409
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,140
丹纳女士  我很感激你到这里来
Mrs. Danner, I appreciate you coming down here,

410
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,740
但我现在不能和你聊这些
but I can't talk about this right now.

411
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,020
我不在乎
I don't care.

412
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,410
你必须听我说
You're gonna listen to what I have to say,

413
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,400
我知道监狱对我儿子的影响  斯佩克特先生
because I saw what prison did to my son, Mr. Specter.

414
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,640
迈克需要知道
Michael needs to know

415
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,380
进去之后的第一天是什么样子
what his first day is gonna be like,

416
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,550
应该和什么样的人交朋友
who to make friends with,

417
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,010
要远离哪些警卫
what guards to stay away from,

418
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,690
因为警卫才是最可怕的
because it's the guards that are the worst.

419
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,490
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know all that?

420
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,550
那就做些什么帮帮那个孩子
Then do something to toughen up that boy.

421
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,450
我说了  我现在不能谈这些
I told you, I can't talk about this right now.

422
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,710
随你便
Go ahead.

423
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,670
走吧
Walk away.

424
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,010
但你欠我的
But you owe me.

425
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,620
因为也许你能把他救出来
Because you may have gotten him out,

426
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,510
但是也正是因为你
but you're also the one who put him in that hellhole

427
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,100
他才会进去
in the first place.

428
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,380
路易  你到底去哪了
Louis, where the hell have you been?

429
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,170
-我们有麻烦了  -你以为我不知道
- We have a problem. - You think I don't know that?

430
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,520
我需要你把律所分割
I need you to bifurcate the firm

431
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,570
成两个实体  我需要你现在就去弄
into two entities, and I need you to do it now.

432
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,430
我知道你的想法
I know what you're thinking.

433
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,370
如果我们把客户隔离  我们就可以留住律师
If we insulate our clients, we can hold on to our lawyers,

434
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,470
但那并没有什么用
but that won't help.

435
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,320
为什么没用
Why the hell not?

436
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,970
因为罗伯特・赞恩已经找到方法破除
Because Robert Zane has a way to 

437
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,900
我们的非竞争条款了
bust our noncompete.

438
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,960
该死的
God damn it.

439
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,530
他找到一个愿意去的人
He finds somebody to jump ship,

440
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,050
那就会有一帮人蜂拥去投奔他
it'll be a stampede for the exits.

441
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,190
这正是我想说的
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

442
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,030
好吧  那就不用分割律所了
All right, then forget about splitting the firm

443
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,780
去查一下他想挖谁
and work on figuring out what the hell he's up to,

444
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,850
不然我们根本不会剩下什么律所了
or there won't be a firm left to split.

445
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,270
我需要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

446
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:30,890
不行  迈克  现在不行
I can't, Mike, not now.

447
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,950
哈维  我需要知道你是否认为
Harvey, I need to know if you think

448
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,450
认罪是正确的决定
I did the right thing taking that plea.

449
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,770
该死的  你现在来问我了
God damn it, you ask me that now?

450
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,150
瑞秋无法接受
Rachel can't get past the fact

451
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,760
我没有等到判决就做决定
that I didn't wait for the verdict to come in.

452
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,590
她非常伤心  我也因此而心痛
It's tearing her up, and that's tearing me up.

453
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,730
-迈克  -哈维  我知道你很生气
- Mike-- - Harvey, I know that you are pissed

454
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,260
我在你之前就达成了协议
that I made a deal before you,

455
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,790
但是我需要你告诉我我的决定是正确的
but I need you to tell me that I made the right call.

456
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,090
你做得对
You did.

457
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,460
你怎么知道
How can you be sure?

458
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,860
因为我去找过陪审团主席
Because I went to see the foreman,

459
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,870
他告诉我他们的判决是有罪
and he told me the verdict was guilty.

460
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,920
什么
What?

461
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,030
听着  你进监狱这件事也让我非常难过
Look, the idea of you going to prison was killing me,

462
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,730
如果我不知道结果会一直纠结
and I couldn't let it go unless I knew.

463
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,040
但你现在不用了
But now you can.

464
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,140
我仍然希望你能让我替你承受这一切
I still wish you would have let me take the hit instead of you,

465
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,710
是的  现在不纠结了
But yeah, I can.

466
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,740
回家吧  迈克
Go home, Mike.

467
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,890
用你所剩的时间去陪瑞秋吧
Get whatever time left you have with Rachel.

468
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,500
现在轻松多了
It's gonna be easier now.

469
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,670
从没想过"有罪"两个字还能有这种效果
I never thought the word "Guilty" would do that.

470
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,880
你还好吗
Are you all right?

471
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,760
我没事
I'm fine.

472
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,350
我能帮你做些什么吗
Can I get you anything?

473
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,580
是的
Yeah.

474
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,670
清空你今天的所有安排
Clear your schedule for the rest of the day.

475
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,250
我需要你帮我搜集迈克庭审的所有资料
I need you to get me everything there is to get from Mike's trial.

476
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,400
哈维  我不明白
Harvey, I don't understand.

477
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,760
你说如果你和那个陪审团主席聊过
You said if you talked to that foreman,

478
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,340
你就能放下这件事了
you would be able to make peace with this.

479
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,220
我不在乎我说了什么
I don't care what I said.

480
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,370
但他说了迈克有罪
And he said that Mike was guilty,

481
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,590
迈克也接受了这种结果
and Mike accepted those consequences.

482
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,990
他没说迈克有罪
He didn't say Mike was guilty.

483
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,580
他说他是无辜的
He said he was goddamn innocent.

484
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,720
我的天哪
Oh, my god.

485
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,240
他要白白承受牢狱之灾了
He's going away for nothing.

486
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,490
不  唐娜  他根本不会去坐牢
No, Donna, he's not going away at all.

487
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,470
你需要我做什么
What do you need me to do?

488
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,460
我需要你帮我
I need you to get me

489
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,960
整理案件的全部信息
everything we have on that trial,

490
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,040
因为我要找到方法
because I'm gonna figure out a way

491
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,080
让那个协议无效
to invalidate that goddamn deal.

492
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,990
杰西卡  你有时间吗
Jessica, do you have a minute?

493
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,760
我现在真的很忙  杰克
I'm really busy right now, Jack.

494
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,780
恐怕这件事不能等
I'm afraid this can't wait.

495
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,180
我正式向你提出辞呈
I'm officially giving you my letter of resignation.

496
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,350
我猜猜
Let me guess.

497
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,830
罗伯特・赞恩向你发出了邀请
Robert Zane made you an offer.

498
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,190
是的
He did,

499
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,780
尽管我非常不想接受
and as much as I didn't want to take it,

500
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,620
但我不得不
I have to.

501
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,920
不得不
Oh, you have to?

502
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,440
你求我再给你一次机会
You begged me for a second chance

503
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,980
然后又是第三次  第四次机会
and a third and a fourth,

504
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,310
我每次都答应了
and I gave them all to you,

505
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,230
现在他是要利用你摧毁我们
and now he's using you to destroy us.

506
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,320
我们已经被摧毁了
We're already destroyed.

507
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,610
你只是不想接受现实
You just don't want to accept it.

508
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,950
不  这只是个挫折
No, this is a setback.

509
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,160
对不起
I'm sorry.

510
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,970
杰克
Jack.

511
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,430
我觉得你忘记了你给过我一个文件夹
I think you're forgetting about that folder you gave me,

512
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,320
那个证明你有些许法律问题的文件夹
the one with the little legal indiscretion

513
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,220
被丹尼尔・哈德曼抓住的
Daniel Hardman had on you.

514
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,740
不要说得那么委婉  杰西卡
Let's not soft-pedal it, Jessica.

515
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,860
那不是不检点  那直接就是犯罪
It wasn't an indiscretion. It was a flat-out crime.

516
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,420
如果把它公之于众
And the problem with you using it is,

517
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,720
就相当于告诉全世界
you'll be announcing to the world

518
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,930
你眼皮底下发生了另一桩犯罪
yet another crime happened under your watch,

519
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,500
而你却没有阻止
and you did nothing to stop it.

520
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,390
而之前愿意留下的客户
And whatever clients were willing to stay with you before

521
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,050
也不会愿意了
won't be willing to anymore.

522
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,370
我想我最想念的会是这个
I think I'm gonna miss this the most.

523
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,450
想念什么
Miss what?

524
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,920
回家见到你
Coming home to you.

525
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,870
瑞秋  我知道我在签协议之前
Rachel, I know I should have told you what I was gonna do

526
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,320
应该告诉你
before I made that deal,

527
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,330
但我之前也不知道我会那样做
but I didn't know I was gonna do it,

528
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,970
我只有  三秒左右的时间做决定
and I had, like, three seconds to make a decision.

529
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,390
而那三秒拿走了整整两年
And those three seconds took away two whole years.

530
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,040
其实  是还给了我们五年
Actually, gave us back five.

531
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,730
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

532
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,300
哈维找到了陪审团主席
Harvey found the jury foreman.

533
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,820
他们本来要判我有罪
They were gonna find me guilty.

534
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,360
我们只有三天时间  我却浪费了一天
And we only had three days, and I took away one of them.

535
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,490
没关系的
Hey, it's okay.

536
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,220
瑞秋  我不在乎
Rachel, I don't care.

537
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,580
只要我们没事就好
As long as we're good.

538
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,540
我不要我们只是没事而已
I don't want us to just be good.

539
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,210
我要我们在一起
I want us to be one.

540
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,730
我想在你走之前成为你的妻子
I want to be your wife before you go.

541
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,510
我想成为你的丈夫
I want to be your husband.

542
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,800
我给我们弄了些咖啡
Okay, I got us some coffees and--

543
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,460
唐娜  搞什么  这不是所有的东西
Donna, what the hell? This isn't everything.

544
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,330
什么叫这不是所有的东西
What do you mean, this isn't everything?

545
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,040
我是说  她得提交动议
I mean, she had to have filed motions

546
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,690
申请传票  然后搜查
and subpoenas and discovery,

547
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,200
而这些东西什么都不是
And all this shit is nothing.

548
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,310
-哈维  这几箱是  -什么
- Harvey, these boxes are-- - what?

549
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,160
这是没有他在上面的班级排名
This is his class ranking that he wasn't on.

550
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,180
这是他的成绩单
This is his transcript.

551
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,570
这是他的年鉴
This is his yearbook.

552
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,650
我们可以在程序上反击的东西在哪里
Where are the things that we can attack procedurally?

553
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,320
在那边
They're over there.

554
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,670
那你为什么还没理清楚那些
Then why haven't you gone through them?

555
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,920
因为那不是我要做的
Because that's not what I do.

556
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,830
那你在这里到底是在干什么
Then what in god's name are you doing in here?

557
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,850
我在支持你  哈维  而现在
I'm supporting you, Harvey, and right now,

558
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,900
我要给你点空间
I'm gonna do that by giving you some space.

559
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,990
如果你以为你可以大摇大摆的
If you think you can waltz into my firm

560
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,830
走进我的公司  挖走我的律师
and take my lawyers,

561
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,570
你一定是疯了
you must be out of your damn mind.

562
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,040
让我猜猜  你要告我引诱
Let me guess, you're suing me for inducement.

563
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,660
那是当然
You bet your ass I am.

564
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,250
你引诱杰克・索罗夫违反他的竞业限制
You induced Jack Soloff into breaking his noncompete.

565
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,700
你对杰克・索罗夫或者其他人都没有竞业限制
You don't have a noncompete with jack soloff or anyone else.

566
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,560
我听说你用这句空话吓了路易
I heard you tried that empty threat with Louis,

567
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,670
但这招对我没用
but it's not gonna work with me.

568
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,870
如果这是空话
If it is empty,

569
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,220
那你的道德条款和章程也都是空话
then so is your morals clause and your bylaws,

570
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,270
因为里面说如果有冠名合伙人
which states that if a named partner

571
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,240
参与犯罪活动  所有合伙人都可以离开
participates in a crime, any partner is free to go.

572
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,380
而谋划诈骗就是该死的犯罪
And conspiracy to commit fraud is a goddamn crime.

573
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,460
你无法证明我们之前知道迈克・罗斯的事
You can't prove we knew about Mike Ross.

574
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,700
让我提醒你  你问了路易・利特
Well, let me suggest that you ask Louis Litt

575
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,930
他今天早上跟卡特里娜・班尼特的对话
about his conversation with Katrina Bennett this morning.

576
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,100
我抓到你的把柄了  杰西卡
I got you, Jessica,

577
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,200
如果你因为我雇了杰克
And if you want to come after me

578
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,370
或者其他任何人  来对付我
for hiring jack, or anyone for hiring anyone,

579
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,760
你可能不用进监狱
You may not go to jail,

580
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,680
但是全世界都会知道你的所作所为
but the world is gonna know what you did.

581
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,410
你为什么要这么做  罗伯特
Why are you doing this, Robert?

582
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,850
我根本不在乎你雇了个骗子  杰西卡
I don't give a shit about you hiring a fraud, Jessica,

583
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,440
但他开始和瑞秋交往的时候
but you never came to me with it 

584
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,810
你没来告诉我
once he started dating rachel.

585
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,600
我怎么知道我可以信任你
How could I have known I could have trusted you

586
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,690
不会来对付我的公司
not to come after my firm?

587
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,390
罗伯特桌上的那张照片
That picture on robert's desk

588
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,180
就可以让你知道  杰西卡
is how you could have known, Jessica.

589
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,970
如果你不介意的话  我们该去剧院了
Now if you'll excuse us, we have tickets for the theater.

590
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,970
刚才不好意思  唐娜
Sorry about before, Donna.

591
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,710
没关系  哈维  我能理解
It's okay, Harvey. I understand.

592
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,420
我在想我们处理这件事的方式不对
And I've been thinking we're going about this all wrong.

593
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,220
你是什么意思
What do you mean?

594
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,880
用法律细节上诉
I mean appealing something based on legal minutiae

595
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,720
不是你该做的
isn't what you do.

596
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,570
那我该做什么
And what exactly is it that I do?

597
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,680
你用其他东西
You get people to do things they don't want to

598
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,920
来让别人去做他门本来不想做的事
by giving them something else.

599
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,270
唐娜  我不能那样对付吉布斯
Donna, I can't do that with Gibbs,

600
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,250
因为她真正想抓的是我
because what she really wants is me,

601
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,710
而迈克不会让我这么做的
and Mike won't let me.

602
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,110
那如果你给她更大的东西呢
And what if you give her something bigger?

603
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,190
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

604
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,690
我是说自由铁路公司
I'm talking about Liberty Rail.

605
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,060
不行
No.

606
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,570
哈维  如果我们愿意让我为自己做的事
Harvey, if we're willing to let me be prosecuted

607
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,660
被审判  那你就可以带给吉布斯
for what I did, then you can give Gibbs

608
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,180
犯了谋杀罪的人并且让迈克幸免于难
people who committed murder and get Mike off the hook.

609
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,670
二比一
Two for one.

610
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,270
唐娜  我不会拿你去换迈克的
Donna, I am not trading you for Mike.

611
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,250
就这样
Period.

612
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,450
那我们怎么办
Then what are we gonna do?

613
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,950
我们要把谋杀犯交给吉布斯
We're gonna give Gibbs her murderers

614
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,580
但不让你受伤害
without giving you up at all.

615
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,460
路易  告诉我
Louis, tell me right now.

616
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,950
你向卡特里娜・班尼特承认
Did you admit to Katrina Bennett

617
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,430
你知道迈克・罗斯的事了吗
that you knew about Mike Ross?

618
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,000
道德条款
The morals clause.

619
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,850
该死的
God damn it.

620
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,040
杰西卡  她早就知道了
Jessica, she already knew.

621
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,530
她知道跟你直接承认
Her knowing and you flat-out confessing

622
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,480
不是一回事
aren't the same thing.

623
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,390
无所谓  她证明不了
It doesn't matter. She can't prove it.

624
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,190
路易  你还不明白吗
Louis, don't you get it?

625
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,940
卡特里娜・班尼特可是你教出来的
Katrina Bennett was your protégé.

626
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,520
你所有见不得人的小动作
All that underhanded shit that you do,

627
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,490
她都学会了
she learned all of it.

628
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,410
你在说什么
What are you saying?

629
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,270
我是说她录音了
I'm saying that she recorded you,

630
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,520
如果那个录音被公之于众的话
and if that tape ever sees the light of day,

631
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,700
所有合伙人只要想走
any partner who wants can walk out that door

632
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,290
就可以带着他们的客户走出那扇门
and take their clients with them.

633
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,270
不  他们走不了
No, they can't.

634
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,930
你去哪里
Where are you going?

635
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,390
档案室
To the file room.

636
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,190
你说得对  杰西卡
You're right, Jessica.

637
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,840
卡特里娜是我教出来的
Katrina was my protégé,

638
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,790
她知道我所有见不得人的事
and she knows all my dirty laundry,

639
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,400
但我也知道她的
but I also know hers.

640
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,720
我来付吧
Let me take care of it.

641
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,130
不用
I don't think so.

642
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,790
上次我们不欢而散
After the way we ended things last time,

643
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,110
至少可以替你买个单
it's the least I can do.

644
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,260
你想怎么样  哈维
What do you want, Harvey?

645
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,440
我想要自由铁路公司
I want Liberty Rail.

646
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,040
那是不可能的
Well, that's never gonna happen,

647
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,570
你需要放下这件事了
and you need to let that shit go.

648
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,720
我需要的是用这件事换迈克・罗斯的自由
What I need is to trade that shit for Mike Ross's freedom.

649
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,610
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

650
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,860
你把自由铁路公司给我
You give me Liberty Rail,

651
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,640
我会给你五个我最好的客户
I'll give you five of my best clients.

652
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,740
杰西卡・皮尔逊不会同意的
There's no way Jessica Pearson allows that to happen.

653
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,590
她说了不算
It's not her call.

654
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,580
他们是我的客户
They're my clients.

655
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,510
我不在乎
Well, I don't care,

656
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,890
因为我不会为了五个客户
because I'm not breaking privilege

657
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,460
违反保密协议还冒着丢饭碗的危险
and risking my entire career in exchange for five clients.

658
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,660
你想怎么样
What's it gonna take?

659
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,590
你想让我开价
You want my price?

660
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,410
我想去皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所采购一番
I want to go shopping at Pearson Specter Litt.

661
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,020
有权雇我想雇的任何人
Exclusive access to hire anyone I want,

662
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,550
从律师助理到高级合伙人以及他们的客户
from paralegals to senior partners and their clients,

663
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,620
整整下个月
for the next month.

664
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,940
你会毁掉律所
You'd be gutting the firm.

665
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,180
你觉得我在乎吗
Do I look like I care?

666
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,280
杰西卡不可能同意
There is no way Jessica accepts this,

667
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,090
你也清楚
and you know it.

668
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,960
我只清楚  人们太渴望时
What I know is, people will do anything

669
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,410
就愿意做任何事
if they're desperate enough.

670
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,710
而如果你来找我了
And if you're in here doing this,

671
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,580
那说明你太渴望救迈克・罗斯
then you're desperate to save Mike Ross.

672
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,910
迈克尔  如果你来见罗伯特
Michael, if you're here to see Robert,

673
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,670
他已经出门了
he's already gone.

674
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,760
我不是来见罗伯特的
I'm not here to see Robert.

675
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,720
我是来见你的
I'm here to see you.

676
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,870
那我希望你走
Well, I'd rather you go.

677
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,020
劳拉  拜托
Laura, please.

678
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,760
拜托什么  迈克尔
Please what, Michael?

679
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,690
罗伯特和我已经准备好接受
Robert and I were ready to embrace

680
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,500
要娶我们女儿的男人
the man who was going to marry our daughter,

681
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,520
结果那人是个骗子
and it turns out, that man is a liar.

682
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,220
你还想让我说服我丈夫
And now you're here to get me to convince my husband

683
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,090
去你的婚礼吗
to go to your wedding?

684
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,600
不只是我的婚礼
It's not just my wedding.

685
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,520
也是瑞秋的
It's also Rachel's.

686
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,380
我可以跟罗伯特谈到面色发青
And I can talk to Robert until I'm blue in the face.

687
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,780
但他绝不会原谅你
He will never forgive you.

688
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,420
他不必原谅我  好吗
He doesn't need to forgive me, all right?

689
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,090
他只用支持他的女儿
He just needs to be there for his daughter.

690
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,400
-他不会那么做的  -为什么
- He's not gonna do that. - Why not?

691
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,860
因为你毁了她的人生
Because you're ruining her life.

692
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,120
劳拉  我知道我犯了大错
Look, Laura, I know that I made a horrible mistake.

693
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,430
为此我要坐两年牢
I'm going away for two years,

694
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,870
而我本可以靠背叛朋友脱罪的
when I could have gotten out of it by turning in my friends.

695
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,060
瑞秋懂我是什么人
Rachel knows that's the kind of man that I am.

696
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,100
所以她才想和我共度此生
That's why she wants to spend the rest of her life with me.

697
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:22,500
而现在  我只求你让罗伯特看到这一点
Now all-all I am asking you is that you help Robert see that.

698
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,860
我了解我丈夫
I know my husband.

699
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,480
你的要求不可能
What you're asking is impossible,

700
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,360
我也不指望你明白
and I don't expect you to understand that,

701
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,920
因为你从没当过女儿的父亲
because you've never been the father of a daughter.

702
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,480
但我会尽力的
But I'll try.

703
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,780
我不懂
I don't understand.

704
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,750
你当然不懂
Of course you don't,

705
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,810
因为你也从没当过女儿的母亲
because you've also never been the mother of a daughter.

706
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,500
路易
Louis.

707
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,430
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

708
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,690
你为什么那么做
Why'd you do it?

709
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,140
做什么
Do what?

710
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,490
别给我装傻  卡特里娜
Don't be coy with me, Katrina.

711
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,030
分享律所章程是一回事
It's one thing to share our bylaws,

712
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,360
但我知道你录了我的音  我想知道原因
but I know you recorded me, and I want to know why.

713
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,580
因为我想让罗伯特・赞恩注意我
I did it because it put my name on the map with Robert Zane.

714
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,210
如果你不毁掉录音
If you don't destroy that recording,

715
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,120
我就让你被别人注意
it's gonna put your name on the map somewhere else.

716
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,230
这是你之前让我伪造的文件的复印件
This is a copy of the document I forged for you.

717
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,050
没错  你昨天提醒我的那份
Yeah, the one you reminded me of yesterday,

718
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,100
如果你不放手  我也会把这份
the same one that I'm gonna give to the SEC

719
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,650
交给证监会
if you don't back off.

720
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,600
你不必这么做
You don't have to do this.

721
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,940
你还可以来与我们同事
You can still come work with us.

722
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,610
不  我做不到  就像我想
No, I can't, and even if I wanted to,

723
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,210
我也不再相信你了
I can't trust you anymore.

724
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,410
这不公平
That's not fair.

725
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,300
如果不找我  你也会找别人
If it wasn't me, it would've been somebody else.

726
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,750
但的确是你  卡特里娜
But it was you, Katrina.

727
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,530
我自己的门徒背后捅我一刀
My own protégé stabbing me in the back?

728
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,300
我只想让自己小有名气
I was just trying to make a name for myself.

729
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,960
我还只是当上冠名合伙人呢
And I just wanted my name on the wall,

730
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,900
但我告诉你
but let me tell you something.

731
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,590
如果我学到了教训
If there's one thing that I have learned,

732
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,750
那就是完全不值得为了出名
it's not worth being willing to do anything

733
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,230
而不择手段
to make a name for yourself.

734
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,010
杰西卡  我得跟你谈谈
Jessica, I need to talk to you.

735
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,970
哈维  我在你提问之前告诉你
Harvey, before you ask whatever you're about to ask,

736
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,980
我没心情
I'm not in the mood.

737
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,260
那也阻止不了我
Well, that's not gonna cut it.

738
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,790
你得放弃伊凡・施密斯的不竞争条款
I need you to waive our noncompetes for Evan Smith.

739
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,140
开玩笑吗
Is this a joke?

740
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,190
这是让迈克不进监狱的唯一办法
It's the only way to keep Mike out of prison.

741
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,760
没办法让迈克不进监狱
There is no way to keep Mike out of prison.

742
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,040
不  有办法
Yes, there is.

743
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,080
把已经想走的人给伊凡
We give Evan people who already want to go,

744
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,460
我给安妮塔・吉布斯凶手名单交换迈克
and I give Anita Gibbs murderers in exchange for Mike.

745
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,380
我过去二十四小时
And I've just spent the last 24 hours

746
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,920
都在设法保住不竞争条款
fighting to keep our noncompetes.

747
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,970
-杰西卡  -不
- Jessica. - No.

748
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,430
他为了救律所达成协议
He cut a deal to save this firm.

749
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,970
他为了不让我们进监狱达成协议
He cut a deal to keep us from going to prison,

750
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,060
你心里清楚
and you know it.

751
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,930
要知道  我根本不关心
You know, I don't give a shit

752
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,180
他达成协议时的想法
what he thought when he made that deal.

753
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,010
他本来会判无罪
He was gonna be found innocent.

754
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,550
什么
What?

755
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,000
我去见了陪审团主席
I went to see the foreman.

756
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,850
判决本来是无罪
The verdict was gonna be not guilty.

757
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,580
那告诉我你和吉布斯的协议
Then let me see your deal with Gibbs.

758
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,790
我还没拿到
I don't have it yet.

759
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,910
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

760
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,440
你让我为了协议对律所进行大屠杀
You're asking me to decimate my firm

761
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,400
而你根本不清楚她接不接受
for a deal you don't even know she'll take?

762
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,960
-我会让她接受的  -你保证不了
- I’ll make her take the deal. - You don't know that.

763
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,930
我可以
Yes, I do.

764
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,290
杰西卡  我们有机会救迈克
Jessica, we have a chance to save Mike

765
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,060
让那些想走的人走
and let the people who want to go, go.

766
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,450
但如果我们输了一切还不管用呢
And what if it doesn't work and we lose everything?

767
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,570
那就这样了
Then we do.

768
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,250
杰西卡  哈维说得没错
Jessica, Harvey's right.

769
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,980
迈克是家人
Mike's family.

770
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,960
就算我们失去了半个律所  但如果没尽力救他
Even if we lose half the firm, if we don't try to save him,

771
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,140
那我们是怎样的人
who are we?

772
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,350
达成协议
Make the deal.

773
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,160
-爸  -他人呢
- Da.. - Where is he?

774
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,570
他不在家
He's not here.

775
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,150
那太糟了
Well, that's too bad

776
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,430
因为我来跟他谈
because I came here to talk to him,

777
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,270
尽管他根本没胆跟我谈
even though he didn't have the balls to talk to me.

778
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,240
他有胆跟你谈
He wasn't afraid to talk to you.

779
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,730
他去找妈妈了  因为我让他这么做
He went to mom because I asked him to.

780
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,700
好吧
Oh, okay.

781
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,280
好吧  话说清楚了
Okay, let's down to this.

782
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,810
你嫁给他  他就会毁掉你的人生
You marry him, and that man ruins your life.

783
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,070
怎么会呢  爸
How, dad?

784
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,640
我们会挺过接下来两年  然后
We're gonna get through the next two years and then--

785
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,770
然后怎样
And then what?

786
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,410
因为你肯定做不成律师了
Because you're sure as shit not gonna be a lawyer.

787
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,380
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

788
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,590
我在说你的毕业问题
I'm talking about you graduating,

789
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,570
你还要去面对
and then you're gonna stand before

790
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,620
律师性格健康委员会
the character and fitness committee of the bar.

791
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,700
据我所知
And the last time I checked,

792
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,220
嫁给一个欺骗过他们的男人
marrying a man that defrauded them

793
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,000
是不会让你进入律师协会的
isn't gonna get you in.

794
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,030
好吧  但是等到那时
Okay, and by the time that happens,

795
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,150
他已经服完刑  我们就已经偿清了他的罪过
he will have served his time, and we will have paid his debt.

796
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,270
那样做到底有什么不同呢
What the hell difference does that make?

797
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:58,850
不同之处在于
The difference is 

798
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,200
那样做关乎我们司法系统的一切
that's what our justice system is all about,

799
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,830
而且永远支持你所爱的人
and standing behind the man that you love

800
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,220
正是性格健康的含义
is the definition of character and fitness.

801
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,270
很好  你对他们说这话
Okay, you tell them that,

802
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,470
他们会告诉你和你的重刑犯丈夫
and they're gonna tell you and your felon husband

803
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,070
-去见鬼吧  -那不会发生的
- to go to hell. - That's not gonna happen.

804
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,140
就是会发生  该死的
Oh, yes it is, god damn it!

805
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,520
这些都是复仇心切  保护欲强的人
These are vindictive and protective people,

806
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,870
而他又把他们当成傻子
and he make them look like fools.

807
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,880
此事并不关于我不能做律师
This isn't about me not becoming a lawyer

808
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,830
也不是关于他毁了我的生活
or him ruining my life

809
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,980
更不是关于你在此说的其他废话
or any of this other bullshit that you're in here saying.

810
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,750
而是因为他欺骗了你
This is because he pulled one over on you.

811
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,520
不能信任他
He can't be trusted!

812
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,180
爸爸  很抱歉我对你隐瞒了此事
Dad, I'm sorry that I kept this from you,

813
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,630
但是他并没对我隐瞒
but he didn't keep it from me,

814
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,810
而且我告诉你我能信任他
and I'm telling you I can trust him.

815
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,200
那我如何信任你呢
And how can I trust you?

816
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,870
如果你不信任我
Well, if you can't,

817
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,590
那或许你就不应该去参加婚礼
then maybe you shouldn't come to the wedding.

818
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,780
没错  大概总结完了
Well, that about sums it up.

819
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,660
我为你感到自豪  迈克尔
I'm proud of you, Michael.

820
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,680
抑制住达成拯救自己协议的诱惑
It's not easy to resist the temptation

821
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,720
那可真不容易
to make a deal that saves yourself.

822
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,210
这个嘛  就我而言
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

823
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,540
我的确达成了拯救自己的协议
I did make a deal that saves myself.

824
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,510
但我来此并不只是为了让你感到自豪
But I didn't just come here to make you proud.

825
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,900
我是来寻求帮助
I came to ask a favor.

826
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,320
尽管说
Name it.

827
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,100
瑞秋和我想在我服刑之前结为夫妻
Rachel and I want to get married before I go.

828
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,030
我知道这通常需要
I know it's not supposed to happen

829
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,890
几个月的时间  但是
for another couple of months but--

830
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,280
但是你没有那个时间
You don't have that kind of time.

831
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,020
我保证不会太麻烦
Look, I promise it's not gonna be too much trouble.

832
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,390
我们不会邀请太多人
We're not gonna invite too many people.

833
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,040
我很荣幸  迈克尔
I'd be honored, Michael.

834
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,470
谢谢你  神父
Thank you, father.

835
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,460
迈克尔  既然你们不打算邀请很多人
Michael, since you're not inviting many people,

836
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,900
我们没必要在这里举行
we don't have to do it in here.

837
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,820
我们总是能在小礼堂举行
We could always do it in the small chapel.

838
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,980
我很感激  神父
I appreciate that, father,

839
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,550
但是我妈妈和爸爸不是在小礼堂举行婚礼的
But my mom and dad weren't married in the small chapel.

840
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,540
很好  你在这儿
Okay, you're here.

841
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,410
是什么如此重要
What's so important I had to

842
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,730
让我为了见你还必须重新安排传讯
reschedule an arraignment to meet with you?

843
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,730
因为那个传讯不能让你
Because that arraignment wasn't gonna lead to you

844
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,990
将一群集团谋杀犯绳之以法
putting corporate murderers behind bars.

845
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,320
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

846
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,980
你掌握了一些犯罪文件
You got a hold of some incriminating documents,

847
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,200
而且你想让我提起公诉
and you want me to prosecute these people

848
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,650
换取免去迈克・罗斯的牢狱之灾
in exchange for keeping Mike Ross out of jail.

849
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,360
谋杀罪换取欺诈罪  简单点
Murder for fraud, straight up.

850
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,530
不感兴趣
Not interested.

851
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,600
听我说
Listen to me.

852
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,520
与之相比  迈克・罗斯犯的罪
Compared to this, what Mike Ross did

853
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,750
几乎就和路边吐痰一样轻微
barely constitutes spitting on a sidewalk.

854
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,680
我知道
I know that.

855
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,950
那你到底是怎么回事
Then what the hell is wrong with you?

856
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,480
告诉你是怎么回事
I'll tell you what's wrong with me.

857
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,570
你
You.

858
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,910
自从你出生那天起
You've been bending the rules

859
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,130
你就一直在破坏规则
since the day you were born,

860
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,890
而我不会再让你得逞
and I'm not letting you get away with it anymore.

861
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,860
你是在和我说笑吗
Are you kidding me?

862
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,800
你把这整个案子的规则都破坏了
You bent rules up and down this entire case.

863
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,060
但我和你之间的区别是
Except the difference between you and me is,

864
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,680
我破坏规则是为了获得正义
I'm bending them to get justice.

865
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,930
将这些人绳之以法就是正义
Putting these people away is justice.

866
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,830
那就直接把他们交给我
Then give them to me anyway.

867
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,530
没错
That's right.

868
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,970
你一直把这个案件作为自己的囊中之物
You've been keeping this case in your back pocket

869
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,820
就是为了以备不时之需
waiting for a rainy day,

870
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,920
因为你就是干那一行的
because that's what you do.

871
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,720
所以或许下一次你有机会
So maybe the next time you have a chance

872
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,750
将杀人犯绳之以法  你应该毫不留情
to put away murderers, you'll do it

873
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,390
而不是留着为了拯救某个毛头小子
instead of saving it up for a chit down the road.

874
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,100
你那么讨厌我吗
You hate me that much?

875
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,510
我不讨厌你  但这就是你做的
I don't hate you, but you did this,

876
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,980
而且你可以想办法逃脱
and you can try to get out of it,

877
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,170
但你不能做的事情  就是否认你做过
but what you can't do anymore is deny you did it.

878
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,390
我没想逃脱此事
I'm not trying to get out of this.

879
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,820
我会代他接受处罚
I'd take the punishment for him.

880
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,190
你曾有大把的机会可以那样做
You had plenty of chances to do that,

881
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,760
但你等到来不及的时候才那样做
but you waited until it was too late.

882
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,630
现在  你想让迈克免受牢狱之灾吗
Now, you want to keep Mike out of prison?

883
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,210
你必须说服他  同意你代他受罚
You have to convince him to let you take his place.

884
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,970
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

885
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,690
哈维  我想和你谈谈
Harvey, I want to talk to you.

886
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,140
很好  因为我也想和你谈谈
Good, because I want to talk to you.

887
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,650
-我想让你做我的伴郎  -什么
- I want you to be my best man. - What?

888
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,570
瑞秋和我想结婚
Rachel and I want to get married.

889
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,610
你离进监狱都不到一天了
You're less than a day from prison,

890
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,760
但你还想着婚纱和鲜花吗
and you're thinking about dresses and flowers?

891
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,070
-哈维  -你知道吗
- Harvey-- - You know what?

892
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,310
我做你伴郎有一个条件
I'll be your best man on one condition.

893
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,100
-为时已晚  -的确如此
- That ship has sailed. - The hell it has.

894
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,060
我们还可以给吉布斯打电话
We can still call Gibbs.

895
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,020
我不会给吉布斯打电话
I am not calling Gibbs.

896
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,250
你用脑子想想
Get it through your head.

897
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,180
这件事该由我承担
This is on me.

898
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,410
不  你用脑子想想
No, you get it through your head.

899
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,290
我不会让你进监狱
I am not letting you go to prison

900
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,580
因为我犯下的罪责
for a crime that I committed.

901
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,810
我不会让你去坐牢
Well, I'm not letting you go

902
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,780
而你的判决本会是无罪
when you were gonna be found innocent.

903
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,120
你刚说什么
What did you say?

904
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,320
没错  我撒谎了
That's right, I lied.

905
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,630
陪审团的裁定是无罪
The verdict was not guilty.

906
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,300
-不  我不相信你  -那给那个人打电话
- No, I don't believe you. - Then call the goddamn guy.

907
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,450
你究竟为何要骗我
Why the hell would you lie to me?

908
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,710
因为真相会击垮你
Because the truth would have broken you.

909
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,120
除非你现在想击垮我
Oh, except now you want to break me?

910
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,150
因为这是唯一的方法你会让我去做
Because it's the only way you're gonna let me do this.

911
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,980
你认为给瑞秋带上戒指
You think putting a ring on Rachel's finger

912
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,140
就会让这一切烟消云散吗
is gonna make everything go away?

913
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,780
你知道吗  哈维
You know what, Harvey?

914
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,860
你如果想参加我的婚礼  告诉我
You want to come to my wedding, you let me know.

915
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,460
你想进监狱吗
You want to go to prison?

916
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,990
首要规则  永远不要背对着任何人
Rule number one: Never turn your back on anyone.

917
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,890
我知道你要干嘛  但没有用
I know what you're doing, and it's not gonna work.

918
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,610
我不会试图取代你的位置
I'm not trying to take your place anymore.

919
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,430
我想让你做好准备
I'm trying to get you ready

920
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,160
就像格洛丽亚・丹纳要求我那样
like Gloria Danner asked me to.

921
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,940
-哈维  -因为你很弱
- Harvey-- - Because you're weak.

922
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,120
我不弱
I am not weak.

923
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,600
-那好  打我啊  -不
- Yeah, well, hit me. - No.

924
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
-打我  -哈维  住手
- Hit me. - Harvey, stop it.

925
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,520
-听着  -不  你听我说
- Listen. - No, you listen to me.

926
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,210
-你认为你不弱吗  -你这样做
- You think you're not weak? - You're only doing this

927
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,770
-只是因为你感到愧疚  -路易・利特
- because you feel guilty, all right? - Louis Litt 

928
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,630
-把你夹在腋下  -但是我不会
- got you in a headlock. - But I am not gonna

929
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,070
-就这样打你  -苔丝的丈夫揍了你一顿
-hit you just because... - Tess's husband kicked your ass.

930
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,930
你接受不了这个事实
You can't handle the fact--

931
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,050
洛根・桑德斯勾引瑞秋
Logan Sanders hooked up with Rachel.

932
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:57,730
-立马住嘴  -你认为他会
- Stop right now. - What do you think he's gonna

933
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,430
怎么样对付她当你进...
do with her the second you get...

934
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,900
这就是你想要的吗  想要我恨你
Is that what you want? That I hate you,

935
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,190
想要我对你这样做吗
and that you made me do this?

936
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,400
我会因为你而失去一切
I'm gonna lose everything because of you!

937
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,390
迈克  拜托
Mike, please.

938
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,440
我们给吉布斯打电话
Let's call Gibbs.

939
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,710
我做不到
I can't.

940
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,130
我做不到  哈维
I can't, Harvey.

941
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,640
做不到
I can't.

942
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,050
干什么呢
What are you doing?

943
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,920
有时候我就是喜欢来看看
Sometimes I like to come and just watch.

944
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,350
看看你的成就吗
See how far you've come?

945
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,380
差不多吧
Oh, something like that.

946
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,370
吉布斯没有接受协议  杰西卡
Gibbs didn't take the deal, Jessica.

947
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,970
对不起  是我错了
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

948
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,270
不  路易  你没错
No, Louis, you were right.

949
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,890
他是家人  我们应该努力的
He's family, and we had to try.

950
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,730
不管剩下谁
And whoever's left,

951
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,460
我们都会更强
we'll be stronger,

952
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,800
即使我们变小了
even if we're smaller.

953
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,880
对不起  迈克
I'm sorry, Mike.

954
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,320
我不该告诉你判决的真相
I shouldn't have told you the truth about the verdict.

955
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,290
我可能从来都不该打你
I probably shouldn't have hit you all those times.

956
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,230
没关系
It's okay.

957
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,420
知道你还有点血性  让我感觉好很多
Makes me feel better knowing you have it in you.

958
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,500
我得走了
I got to go.

959
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,070
我得去求瑞秋嫁给我
I got to ask Rachel to marry me.

960
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,080
你们不是就要结婚了吗
I thought you were already getting married.

961
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,120
还有些事我得先告诉她
There's something I got to tell her first.

962
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,840
你是来幸灾乐祸的吗
You come here to gloat?

963
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,530
今晚不太合适
Because tonight is not the night.

964
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,540
不  罗伯特
No, Robert.

965
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,330
我是来讲和的
I came here to make peace.

966
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,000
你是对的
You were right.

967
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,440
我该来告诉你  我很抱歉我没有
I should have come to you, and I'm sorry I didn't,

968
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,810
而我余生都会为此后悔
and I will regret that for the rest of my life.

969
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,990
但我听说瑞秋明天要结婚
But I understand Rachel is getting married tomorrow,

970
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,500
我要告诉你  如果你不去
and I'm telling you, if you're not there for her,

971
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,470
你余生都会为此而后悔
you will regret it for the rest of yours.

972
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,400
瑞秋
Rachel?

973
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,640
我在卧室
I'm in the bedroom.

974
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,890
别进来
Don't come in.

975
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,210
为什么  怎么了
Why? What's wrong?

976
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,090
不  没事
No, nothing's wrong.

977
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,960
我在试婚纱
I-I have my dress on.

978
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,010
瑞秋  拜托
Rachel, come on, please.

979
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,040
婚礼会有无数的事情
There are about a million things with this wedding

980
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,950
进行得不尽如人愿
that aren't going as planned,

981
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,610
我都能接受
and I'm fine with that,

982
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,490
但我不要让你看到我穿婚纱的样子
But I'm not gonna jinx it by having you 

983
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,620
而毁掉婚礼
see me in my dress.

984
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,560
瑞秋  判决的事我说错了
Rachel, I was wrong about the verdict.

985
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,910
哈维对我说了谎
Harvey lied to me.

986
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,700
他们准备判我无罪的
They were gonna find me not guilty.

987
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,890
瑞秋  求你开门
Rachel, please open the door.

988
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,720
你为什么要现在告诉我
Why are you telling me this right now?

989
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,480
因为你是在知道我会被判有罪后
Because you only wanted to get married

990
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,280
才愿意结婚的
after you found out I was guilty,

991
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,950
而我不想让我们共同生活的开始
and I didn't want to start our life out

992
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,300
基于另一个谎言
with another secret.

993
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,550
你是对的
You were right.

994
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,190
我应该对自己有信心
I should have had faith in myself,

995
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,210
但我没有
and I didn't.

996
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,660
如果你不想结婚了
If you don't want to do this now,

997
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,290
我也理解
I understand.

998
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,810
我们可以在我出来之后结婚
We can do it when I get out.

999
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,340
在我想象中  你就在外面
In my mind, you are out,

1000
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,560
没人知道
And no one knows what's gonna happen

1001
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,240
婚后会发生什么
after they get married.

1002
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,220
他们只知道
They just know what's gonna happen

1003
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,790
他们结婚那天会发生什么
the day that they do.

1004
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,220
而我们结婚的日子就是明天
And the day we're getting married is tomorrow.

1005
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,860
我从没见过更漂亮的新娘子
I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful bride.

1006
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,300
那太好了  因为我也没见过
That's good, because I have never seen

1007
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,690
更漂亮的伴娘
a more beautiful maid of honor.

1008
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,250
我不想打扰你
So I don't want to bother you,

1009
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,370
但我就是想进来
but I just wanted to come in and give you a little bit

1010
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,920
提前给你个结婚礼物
of an early wedding present.

1011
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,300
唐娜  你不用这样的
Donna, you don't have to do that.

1012
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,780
你爸爸妈妈来了
Your mom and dad are here.

1013
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,300
谢谢你
Thank you.

1014
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,020
别谢我  谢杰西卡
Oh, don't thank me. Thank Jessica.

1015
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:53,370
我先去戴项链了
Um...I'm gonna go and put my necklace on

1016
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,600
以免我把眼妆哭花
before I make my mascara run.

1017
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,610
好  我在外面等你
Okay, I'll just be outside.

1018
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,400
不  等等  我希望
No, no, please, I would, um...

1019
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,930
我希望你陪着我
I'd rather you stay.

1020
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,640
好
Okay.

1021
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,540
唐娜  我能跟瑞秋说句话吗
Donna, can I talk to rachel for a second?

1022
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,200
迈克  不行
Mike, you can't.

1023
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,970
你在婚礼前不能见她
You can't see her before the ceremony.

1024
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,170
唐娜  拜托
Donna, please.

1025
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,170
唐娜  能不能帮我把...
Okay, Donna, can you just help me put--

1026
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,610
迈克  你不能见到我穿婚纱的样子
Mike, you can't see me in my dress.

1027
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,940
瑞秋  我们不能结婚
Rachel, we can't do this.

1028
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,950
什么
What?

1029
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,120
我来的时候看到了你父母
I just walked in and I saw your parents.

1030
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,750
他们是不得不来的
They're here because they have to be,

1031
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,280
不是因为他们想来
not because they want to be.

1032
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,030
迈克
Mike--

1033
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,980
不只是你爸爸的表情
It wasn't just the look on your father's face.

1034
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,960
还有你妈妈的
It's the look on your mother's.

1035
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,450
他们觉得我在夺走你的未来
They think I'm taking away your future.

1036
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,870
你就是我的未来
You are my future.

1037
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,830
我不是说我不想结婚
I am not saying that I don't want to get married.

1038
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,310
我只是说如果有什么事导致
I'm just saying that if for some reason

1039
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:33,030
我成了夺走你梦想的原因
I was responsible for taking away your dream...

1040
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,190
你会永远无法原谅你自己
That you'd never be able to live with yourself.

1041
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,600
你去读完法学院  好吗
You go finish law school, okay?

1042
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,640
通过律师资格考试  成为律师
And you pass the bar, and you become a lawyer,

1043
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,220
然后  两年后我出来
And then...in two years when I get out,

1044
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,870
如果你还想嫁给我
if you still want to marry me...

1045
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,930
我会的
Oh, I will.

1046
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,770
我当然会的
Of course I will.

1047
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:20,950
你怎么知道呢
How'd you know?

1048
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,890
我就是知道  而且我不可能
I knew, and there's no way

1049
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,520
让你独自去
I'm letting you do this alone.

1050
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,020
都走了
They're all gone.

1051
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,670
{\an8}联邦监狱

1052
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,930
这不是你的错  哈维
It's not your fault, Harvey.

1053
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,100
是我自己做的
I made my case.

1054
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,210
我说服你雇了我
I convinced you to hire me.

1055
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,900
是我做的决定
I was the one that made the call.

1056
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,070
没错
You were.

1057
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,280
但那不重要
But it doesn't matter.

1058
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,850
因为就算我知道结果
'Cause even knowing how it all turned out...

1059
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,110
我也还会再来一次
I'd do it again.

1060
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,270
我猜我也会
I guess I would too,

1061
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:53,830
因为我觉得再过一百万年
'cause I never thought in a million years

1062
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,130
我也不会认识哪个人
I'd meet someone dumb enough

1063
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,280
傻到会为我进监狱
to be willing to go to prison for me.

1064
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,310
唐娜总是说
I mean, Donna always said

1065
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,400
你在找另一个你
you were looking for another you.

1066
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,800
我想你找到了
I guess you found one.

1067
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,590
我想是该努力地
I guess it's time to get busy living

1068
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,280
忙着生  或赶着死了[《肖申克救赎》]
and get busy dying.

1069
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,830
说得一点都没错
Well, that's goddamn right.

1070
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,470
在里面多加小心  迈克
Watch your back in there, Mike.

1071
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:35,980
我会的
I will.
