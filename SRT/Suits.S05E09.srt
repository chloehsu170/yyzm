{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,040
依照公司章程第28b条
Pursuant to section 28-b of the bylaws,

16
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,870
我提议让哈维・斯佩克特立刻免薪停职
I am placing Harvey specter on immediate unpaid suspension.

17
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,380
但投票的结果可能对你不利
That vote's not gonna go well for you.

18
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,640
你的确需要做出谦逊的姿态
You need to do something to humble yourself.

19
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,270
这是什么
What is this?

20
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,760
我希望你替我给
Portfolio of business I want you to take

21
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,800
皮尔逊-斯佩克特的案子
to Pearson Specter for me.

22
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,550
我不会那么做的
I'm not doing it.

23
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,770
是我记错了  还是我们没讨论过这事
Am I mistaken, or did we not have this discussion?

24
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,890
别再打给我了
Don't call me again.

25
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,080
丹尼尔・哈德曼办公室
Daniel Hardman's office.

26
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,400
立刻让他听电话
I need to speak to him right now.

27
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,490
他寄了两个包裹  要么你按照一个继续
He sent two packages. Either move forward

28
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,580
要么他按照另一个继续
on one of them or he'll move forward on the other.

29
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,030
瑞秋  我需要你独自解决这次会议
Rachel, you have to handle this meeting by yourself.

30
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,940
-什么  -她知道我没上过法学院
- What? - She knows that I didn't go to law school.

31
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,580
你要不告诉我发生了什么
I'm calling the DA's office right now

32
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,380
我就给检察官办公室打电话
if you don't tell me what the hell's going on.

33
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,230
我们订婚了
We're engaged.

34
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,010
所以确实是他
So it is him.

35
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,760
求你了  求你了
Please, I am begging you.

36
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,910
完事了
It's done.

37
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,900
-她信了  -是的
- She bought it? - She did.

38
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,160
你觉得我不该再做律师
You think I should stop being a lawyer?

39
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,010
我是说你要真爱她  就不会跟她结婚
I'm saying if you really love her, you won't marry her.

40
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,430
你在干什么
What are you doing?

41
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,820
就是在凝视你的美丽
Just looking at how beautiful you are.

42
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,880
我已经答应了  你不用这么...
I already said yes, so you don't have to--

43
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,120
你今早怎么了
What got into you this morning?

44
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,170
有时我会想我们是如何共同走到这一步的
Sometimes I just think about how we got to be here together.

45
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,040
我会怀疑自己是不是配得上你
Then I wonder if I deserve you.

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,470
然后我就会希望我们能赖在这张床上
And then I wish that we could just stay here in this bed

47
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,020
一辈子
for the rest of my life.

48
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,620
我也是
So do I.

49
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,750
这跟之前我们差点
Does--does this have anything to do

50
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,580
被发现有关吗
with the close call we had?

51
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,190
有关
It does.

52
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,030
我觉得没有表达出足够的感谢
I just don't think I ever thanked you enough for...

53
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,510
谢你一直支持我
having my back.

54
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,930
你现在还不知道我会一直支持你吗
Don't you know by now that I will always have your back?

55
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,250
我知道
I do.

56
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,170
哈维  不论结果如何  我们不能表现出软弱
Harvey, no matter how this goes, we don't show weakness,

57
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,960
不能表现出嫌隙  也不能用路易出气
we don't show division, and we don't take it out on Louis.

58
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,490
那会很难  因为我们之所以得开这个会
Well, that's gonna be tough, because we wouldn't even be here

59
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,950
就是因为那个混蛋
if it wasn't for that conniving son of a bitch.

60
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,790
哈维  路易昨晚来找我
Harvey, Louis came to me last night,

61
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,020
说他会更改他的投票的
said he was gonna flip his vote.

62
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,960
不管你原谅他与否  别得罪他
So forgive him or not, don't antagonize him.

63
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,290
你还有机会从这事里脱身
There's still a chance you could get out of this.

64
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,560
早上好  各位
Good morning, everyone.

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,770
哈维  在投票之前  你想说点什么吗
Harvey, before we vote, would you like to say something?

66
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,990
好的
I would.

67
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,990
鉴于这次投票的目的
As far as the official purpose of this vote,

68
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,530
我不会用谎言侮辱各位
I'm not gonna insult any of you by lying to you.

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,240
我打了路易  我私下也向他道歉了
I hit Louis, and I apologized to him in private,

70
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,480
但我没有做的是向你们大家道歉
but what I haven't done is apologize to all of you.

71
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,050
我的酬金一直对我很重要
My compensation has always been important to me.

72
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,530
并不是因为钱  而是它代表了
Not for the money, but for what it says

73
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,810
我在这家律所的地位
about my place in the firm.

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,040
但这不只是间律所  还是个合作关系
But this isn't a firm. It's a partnership.

75
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,980
而我的合作伙伴对我来说要比钱重要得多
And my partners are more important to me than money.

76
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,830
因此从今天开始  我将我的佣金提成比例
So, starting today, I'm reducing my compensation

77
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,180
降低到中间值
to the median amount,

78
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,150
多出的部分分给所有的合伙人
with the rest going to all my partners to share.

79
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,470
不论你们投票的方向如何我都会这么做
And I'm doing this regardless of how you vote today.

80
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,700
感谢各位的聆听
Thank you for listening.

81
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,500
路易  你想提出反对观点吗
Louis, would you like to present an opposing view?

82
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,090
我们速战速决吧
Let's just get this over with.

83
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,710
好的  我们采用不记名投票的方式
Okay. We'll do this by secret ballot.

84
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,990
最终投票结果
The final vote

85
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,570
八票赞成停职  八票反对
is eight for suspension, eight against,

86
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,650
也就是说动议不会通过
which means the motion will not carry.

87
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,560
因此哈维不会被停职
Therefore, Harvey will not be suspended.

88
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,680
好了  如果没别的事
Now, if no one has anything else,

89
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,690
就散会回去工作吧
I would like to get back to business.

90
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,480
事实上  我想要提议
Actually, I would like to propose

91
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,450
一个新议程
a new piece of business.

92
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,860
丹尼尔・哈德曼刚签下了一个十亿级别的客户
Daniel Hardman just signed a billion-dollar client...

93
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,160
-什么  -他提议与我们分享客户
- What? - And in exchange for sharing that client with us,

94
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,470
作为交换条件他想要回到律所
he'd like to return to the firm on a trial basis.

95
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,320
丹尼尔・哈德曼休想踏进这间律所半步
There is no way Daniel Hardman is setting foot in this office.

96
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,720
你肯定会那么想  因为那意味着
Of course you'd think that, because that would mean

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,990
我们其余人会挣更多钱
more money for the rest of us.

98
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,860
你在开玩笑嘛  我刚向大家证明了
Are you kidding me? I just showed everyone here

99
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,620
我不在乎钱
I don't care about money.

100
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,110
你刚向我们证明了为了阻止停职
You just showed us that you'll do anything

101
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,580
你不惜一切代价  包括贿赂合伙人
to get out of a suspension, including bribing the partners.

102
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,970
也许你能骗过我们一半人
Well, you may have fooled half of us,

103
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,220
但还有一半人不买账
but the other half didn't buy it.

104
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,480
够了  丹尼尔・哈德曼无论如何
That's enough. Daniel hardman will not return

105
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,990
都不能回来
to this firm under any circumstance.

106
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,500
你当然支持哈维
And of course you back Harvey.

107
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,380
这与哈维无关  这关乎我的律所
This is not about Harvey. This is about my firm.

108
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,900
很明显大家都知道一切都与哈维有关
It's always about harvey and it's clear to everyone here,

109
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,880
他做什么你都觉得无所谓
whatever he does is fine with you,

110
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,380
无论是打合伙人
from hitting another partner

111
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,320
还是拒绝律所数百万的收入
to turning down millions for this firm.

112
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,310
你这个混蛋两面派
You two-faced piece of shit.

113
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,860
为什么不让合伙人们来决定
Why don't we let the partners decide?

114
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,550
不用合伙人来决定
I don't have to let the partners decide,

115
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,350
因为这是我的决定
because this is my decision,

116
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,490
我的决定是  现在休会
and my decision is, this god damn meeting is adjourned!

117
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,850
你是怎么滚上来的
How the hell did you get up here?

118
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,830
我和楼下的卡尔很有交情
Carl downstairs and I go back.

119
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,730
你可以带着卡尔一起从哪来回哪去
Well, you can take Carl back where you came from.

120
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,550
因为你到这里来需要预约
Because you need an appointment to be here.

121
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,410
我有些东西要交给哈维
I have something I need to deliver to Harvey.

122
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,170
那我建议你把它交给他的秘书  格蕾琴
Then I suggest you leave it with his secretary, Gretchen.

123
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,550
他的秘书  格蕾琴  这几个字我倒是
"His secretary, gretchen." Now, there's three words

124
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,320
从来没想过会从你嘴里说出来
I never thought I'd hear you say.

125
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,260
哈维把你丢给路易
Ooh. How long has it been

126
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,320
多长时间了
since Harvey dumped you onto Louis's desk?

127
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,470
我多久没有扇过你耳光了
How long has it been since I slapped you in the face?

128
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,020
因为现在我脑子里只有这件事
Because that is all I can think about right now.

129
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,860
承诺就是承诺
Promises, promises.

130
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,300
如果你来是要回你的旧办公室  丹尼尔
If you're here to take back your old office, daniel,

131
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,990
先别把尺子拿出来了
don't break out the measuring tape just yet,

132
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,150
因为你渗透回来的路径刚被堵死了
because your plan to worm your way in just failed.

133
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,180
所以你怎么进来就怎么出去吧
So you can walk your ass out the same way you walked in.

134
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,790
路易  看到你和哈维在经历了这么多事以后
Louis, it's so fascinating seeing you and harvey

135
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,890
还能如此团结真是太令人惊喜了
united like this after all you must have been through.

136
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,240
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

137
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,420
她啊
Her.

138
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,730
看来你终于在某些事上赢了他
I see you finally got the better of him on something.

139
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,170
我没有在任何事上赢他
I didn't get the better of him on anything.

140
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,520
我们之间不存在什么嫌隙
There's no daylight between us.

141
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,450
赶紧滚出去
Now get the hell out of here.

142
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,180
动作快点  不然我就叫保安
And do it quick before I have to call security

143
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,180
告诉他们我要把你揍得屁滚尿流了
to tell them I'm beating the shit out of you.

144
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,420
不用了
No need.

145
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,100
既然你们对我要说的事不感兴趣
Since you're not interested in what I have to say,

146
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,380
那我就去找杰西卡
I'll go see Jessica.

147
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,140
还有我们悄悄地说
And just between us chickens,

148
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,020
你们俩之间的嫌隙太大了
there's a chasm of daylight between you two.

149
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,380
皮尔逊-斯佩克特的最新晋合伙人过得如何
Hey, how's Pearson Specter's newest partner?

150
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,220
你是说我  还是丹尼尔・哈德曼
Are you talking about me or daniel hardman?

151
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,340
消息传得真快啊
News travels fast.

152
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,290
涉及到人渣的事确实如此
It does when it's news about a lying sack of shit.

153
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,590
迈克  我希望着眼未来的合伙人
Mike, I would hope that a partner with his eye

154
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,480
能更加的宽容一些
on the future would be more forgiving.

155
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,190
你是说欠你人情的合伙人吧
You mean a partner that owes you.

156
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,640
你来不是为了丹尼尔  是为了我吧
You're not here about Daniel. You're here about me.

157
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,050
你猜对了
You're goddamn right I am.

158
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,010
你提拔我只是为获得哈维的信任
You promoted me just to get harvey to trust you

159
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,210
然后有机会陷害他
so you could set him up.

160
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,600
-我没有  -放屁
- No I didn't. - Bullshit.

161
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,140
不  有天赋的律师
No, bullshit is a gifted lawyer being held down

162
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,230
被他所效忠的合伙人压制才叫放屁
by partners to whom he's pledged his loyalty.

163
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,450
这就回到我刚刚说过的话
Which brings me back to what I just said a minute ago.

164
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,200
你自以为收买了我的忠诚
You think you bought my loyalty.

165
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,520
迈克  站哪边随你选
Mike, you can pick whatever side you want,

166
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,550
但当尘埃落定
But when the dust settles,

167
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,770
哈维和杰西卡就会走人了
and Harvey and Jessica are gone,

168
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,130
而你还有立足之地  因为我尊重你
there'll be a place for you here because I respect you.

169
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,290
我来告诉你件事吧  杰克
Let me tell you something, Jack.

170
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,550
等尘埃落定
When the dust settles,

171
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,670
哀求立足之地的是你
you're gonna be the one begging for a place,

172
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,240
而我则会劝他们踢你出去
and I'm gonna be the one recommending they throw you out.

173
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,970
你真该试试那种站式办公桌
You really should try one of those standing desks.

174
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,200
对你这个年龄的女人的背部有好处
It's better on the back for a woman of your age.

175
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,570
对你这种高度的男人  这已经是站式的了
This is a standing desk for a man of your height.

176
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,410
-很高兴见到你  杰西卡  -别装了
- Nice to see you, Jessica. - No, it isn't.

177
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,550
我上次见到你的时候
And the last time I saw you,

178
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,320
警告过你离我的律所远点
I told you to stay the hell away from my firm.

179
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,980
而好律师在面对利益时
And a good lawyer puts aside their feelings

180
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,120
可以抛开私人感情
when there's money on the table.

181
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,070
省省吧  丹尼尔  你从进门那一刻起
Oh, cut the shit, Daniel. Second you get your foot

182
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,150
就已经开始谋划
in the door, you'll start hatching a plan

183
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,940
-怎么把我赶到大街上去了  -说的没错
- to put me on the street. - You're right.

184
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,560
但你作茧自缚  合伙人们无论如何
But thanks to you, the partners will put you

185
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,790
都会把你赶到大街上去了
on the street anyway.

186
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,120
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

187
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,770
我要与你共享的客户
The client I was willing to share with you

188
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,880
想进行多项收购
is looking to make numerous acquisitions,

189
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,840
而收购来的公司也会成为你的新客户
and those acquisitions would have been new clients for you too.

190
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,650
可你不同意  所以我们会以你们的客户为目标
Instead, we're going to start targeting your clients

191
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,510
进行收购  每家成功收购的公司
as acquisitions, and everyone we close

192
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,660
都会抛弃你们  转投我的怀抱
leaves you and comes right over to me.

193
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,830
所有的合伙人都会知道这是谁的错
And now all the partners will know why it's happening.

194
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,360
而你的走狗  杰克・索罗夫会告诉合伙人
And your puppet, Jack Soloff, tells the partners,

195
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,610
"如果让你回来  血战就会停止"
"If we let you back, the bleeding stops."

196
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,170
这正是我来的原因
Which is why I'm here.

197
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,750
为了谢谢你
To thank you.

198
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,980
要是你当时答应我
It would be so much less delightful

199
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,650
就太没意思了
if you had just said yes right away.

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,410
至少你可以告诉我你的第一个目标
Well the least you could do is tell me your first target.

201
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,700
给你个提示
I'll give you a hint.

202
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,750
是家会直接伤你要害的公司
It's one that's gonna hit you right where it hurts.

203
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,620
真不敢相信几个月后我们就要回来
I can't believe that in a couple of months

204
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,870
参加你的婚礼了
we'll be back here for your wedding.

205
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,510
我懂  棒极了  我也难以相信
I know, it's amazing. I can't believe

206
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,650
居然还有那么多事要办
how much we have left to do.

207
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,110
说到这个
Mmm, speaking of which.

208
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,400
这是什么
What's this?

209
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,180
要登在《时代周刊》上的结婚通告
Your wedding announcement for "The Times."

210
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,920
我知道你很忙  所以我就代劳
I know that you're busy, so I took the liberty

211
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,140
帮你写了
of writing it up.

212
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,450
-结婚通告  -没错
- Wedding announcement? - Yes.

213
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,990
妈妈  我觉得...
Um, mom, I don't think that--

214
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,260
有几个地方我留空了
I left a couple of things blank.

215
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,820
我不知道迈克的念的是哪所大学
I wasn't sure where Mike went for undergrad.

216
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,280
是康奈尔还是哥伦比亚
Was it Cornell or Columbia?

217
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,880
他是不是上过哈佛法学院的期刊
Oh, and was he on the Harvard Law Review?

218
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,270
他们还要一张你们俩的合照
And they're gonna want a picture of the two of you.

219
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,650
去中央公园的船屋拍怎么样
I was thinking maybe the central park boathouse?

220
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,040
我们不做结婚通告
We're not doing an announcement.

221
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,790
-什么  -我和迈克对这个不是很感兴趣
- What? - Mike and I, we're not interested in this.

222
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,490
我不明白
I don't understand.

223
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,820
你读你表妹妮可的通告的时候
When you read your cousin Nicole's announcement,

224
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,940
也没见你有意见啊
you didn't have a problem with it.

225
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,290
因为这事符合妮可的风格
'Cause something like this is right for Nicole.

226
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,460
我不喜欢
It's not right for me.

227
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,390
其实是迈克不喜欢吧
You mean it's not right for Mike?

228
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,730
妈妈  你说什么呢
Oh, come on, mom. What are you talking about?

229
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,300
两年前  你根本不会对这个
Two years ago, you wouldn't have had a problem

230
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,040
有任何意见
with something like this.

231
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,550
现在不是两年前
Well, it's not two years ago,

232
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,620
而且我和他都不想弄
and this is how we both feel.

233
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,940
所以我希望你能尊重我的意愿
So I'm just asking you to respect my wishes

234
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,580
因为待办的事还有一大堆呢
because we have so much more to go over, okay?

235
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,640
要我说就是魅力派美妆
I'm telling you it's Cutie Pie Cosmetics.

236
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,830
琼就要退休了
Joan's ready to retire.

237
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,970
没人会在意琼・沃尔什的公司
No one gives a shit about Joan Walsh's business.

238
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,220
肯定是纳德通讯
It's Nader Communications.

239
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,350
为什么  就因为他们是你的客户吗
Why, because they're you're client?

240
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,870
不  因为他们曾是杰克的客户
No, because they were Jack's client

241
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,270
现在是我的客户
and now they're my client.

242
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,290
所以一切都是因为你了
So this is all about you?

243
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,210
-路易  冷静  -不  这都是因为你
- Louis, calm down. - No, this is all about you.

244
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,800
让哈德曼有机可乘的人就是你
You know what? You're the one who gave Hardman the opening he needed.

245
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,140
-你们听到我的话了吗  -你说什么
- Did you hear what I just said? - Excuse me?

246
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,800
你没听错  要不是你想停我的职
Yeah, you heard me. This wouldn't be happening

247
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,080
这一切都不会发生
if you didn't try to suspend me.

248
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,410
那是因为你打我
After you punched me in the face.

249
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,510
你要真想知道元凶是谁
If you really want to know who's at fault here,

250
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,610
不如去照照镜子
why don't you take a look in the mirror?

251
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,870
够了
That's enough.

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,860
现在的情形正是哈德曼希望的
This is exactly what Hardman wants.

253
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,800
他想让我们内讧
He's trying to get us to turn on each other.

254
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,260
战争打的是门外人  不是家里人
Well, the fight is out there, not in here,

255
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,320
我们得想出哈德曼的目标是谁
And we have to figure out who Hardman's target is.

256
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,680
你要去哪儿
Where the hell are you going?

257
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,150
你说的没错  战争打的是门外人
You're right, the fight is out there,

258
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,800
但杰克・索罗夫还在门里呢
But Jack Soloff's in here.

259
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,090
让他去找杰克合适吗
You think it's a good idea to let him go after Jack?

260
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,410
他还能干什么  让杰克更疏远我们吗
What's he gonna do? Make him less on our side?

261
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,690
也对
You're right.

262
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,880
这里还有更重要的事要办
There's more important things to do here anyway.

263
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,280
是啊  首要的就是
Yeah, and number one on the list

264
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,310
如果你觉得哈德曼的目标真的是纳德通讯
is if you think that Hardman's really going after Nader Communications,

265
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,110
那我们得过去警告他们
then we need to get over there and warn them.

266
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,270
不是纳德  是麦肯诺汽车
It's not Nader, it's McKernon Motors.

267
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,710
不可能是麦肯诺  他们太小了
It can't be McKernon. They're too small.

268
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,230
电池那单搞定之后就不小了
Not since we did that battery deal.

269
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,360
我知道你想说什么
And I know what you're gonna say,

270
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,700
"艾弗里・麦肯诺的资产
"Avery McKernon's estate still owns

271
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,280
套在股市里的部分太多了"
too much of the stock,"

272
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,130
但现在不是了
but not anymore.

273
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:31,940
谁收购了
Who bought it?

274
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,220
收购的是谁不重要
It doesn't matter who bought it.

275
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,750
重点是经手的律师是谁
It matters who the attorney of record is.

276
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,730
-我猜猜  丹尼尔・哈德曼吧  -没错
- Let me guess, Daniel Hardman. - Exactly.

277
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,310
见鬼
Goddamn it.

278
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,470
哈维  你要干什么
Harvey, what are you doing?

279
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,980
我要去见多米尼克・巴伦
I'm going to see Dominic Barone.

280
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,030
-那我跟你一起去  -你别去
- Well, then I'm going with you. - No, you're not.

281
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,290
他们是我最老的客户
They're my oldest client,

282
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,600
这事得我去做
and this is something I have to do.

283
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,120
哈维  这客户你已经交给我和路易了
Harvey, this is a client that you gave to me and Louis.

284
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,500
是啊  而你足够聪明
Yeah, and you were smart enough

285
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,910
想到他们就是目标
to figure out they were the target.

286
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,590
现在我要你用那聪明脑子
Now I need you to use that brain

287
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,810
开始想想我们怎么才能摆平这件事
to start figuring out how we're gonna get out of this.

288
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,940
你要做什么
What are you gonna do?

289
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,830
我要去看着多米尼克・巴伦的眼睛
I'm gonna look Dominic Barone in the eye

290
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,400
告诉他出这些事都是因我而起
and tell him I'm the reason this is happening.

291
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,630
杰克  我要和你谈谈
Jack, I need to talk to you.

292
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,470
省省吧  路易
You can save your breath, Louis.

293
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,680
我知道你要说什么
I know what you're here to say.

294
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,500
你是来告诉我别对你宝贵的
You're here to tell me not to go against

295
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,000
哈维和杰西卡下手
your precious Harvey and Jessica.

296
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,360
不  我是来告诉你  你根本不了解
No, I'm here to tell you that you have no idea

297
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,680
和你联手的那个人
who you're in bed with.

298
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,400
谢谢你对我的关心
Well, I appreciate your concern for my well-being,

299
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,530
-但我能处理好  -你处理不好
- But I can handle myself. - No you can't.

300
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,320
这有什么区别呢  路易
What difference does it make, Louis?

301
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,080
-为时已晚了  -还不是很晚
- It's too late. - It's not too late.

302
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,070
你觉得如果我突然抛弃了丹尼尔
You think if I suddenly abandon Daniel,

303
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,490
杰西卡就会张开双臂欢迎我回去吗
Jessica's just gonna welcome me back with open arms?

304
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,820
会啊  你都不知道她有多宽容
Yes, you don't know how forgiving she can be.

305
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,460
我相信她  她原谅我的唯一方式
I trust her. The only thing she's going

306
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,370
就是一刀捅死我
to forgive me with is a knife in the back.

307
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,680
杰克  听我说
Jack, listen to me.

308
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,290
丹尼尔・哈德曼曾经把我当儿子对待
Daniel Hardman treated me like a son.

309
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,940
他提拔我为高级合伙人
He promoted me to senior partner,

310
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,910
利用我接管了律所
used me to take over the firm.

311
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,550
他失势后  就过河拆桥
After he lost power, he turns around

312
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,400
甩给我一个性骚扰的罪名
and slaps me with a sexual harassment claim.

313
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,610
我知道  莫妮卡・伊顿
I know. Monica Eaton.

314
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,550
但你不知道的是这些都是胡扯
But what you don't know is that it was bullshit.

315
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,890
他背叛了我
He betrayed me.

316
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,080
羞辱了我
Humiliated me.

317
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,180
在我终于跟他当面对质后
And after I finally confronted him about it,

318
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,290
他告诉我
he tells me...

319
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,110
我是得到了一直想要的东西
that I got what I always wanted.

320
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,200
杰克  相信我  如果你觉得
So, Jack, believe me, if you think this man

321
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,550
这个人在乎你  他根本不在乎
cares about you, he doesn't.

322
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,220
我知道他是什么样的人  路易
I know what kind of man he is, Louis.

323
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,030
那你为什么还站在他那边
Then why are you siding with him?

324
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,540
我告诉你为什么
I'll tell you why.

325
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,980
他对我承诺了杰西卡永远不会做的事
He promised to do something Jessica never would.

326
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,620
让我的名字上墙
Put my name on the wall.

327
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,860
如果她会呢
What if she would?

328
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,820
你太不现实了
You're not in reality.

329
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,220
杰克  她为我这么做了
Jack, she did it for me.

330
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,720
即使我想转换阵营  也做不到
Even if I wanted to go with you, I couldn't.

331
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,310
你有把柄在他手上  对吧
He's got something on you, doesn't he?

332
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,300
这场谈话结束了
This conversation is over.

333
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,140
哈维  什么鬼
Harvey, what the hell?

334
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,070
我刚收到要约收购通知
I just got notification of a tender offer.

335
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,520
他们要对我的公司下手
They're coming after my company.

336
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,850
我知道  所以我才来了
I know, that's why I'm here.

337
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,940
因为这是场恶意收购
So they sent the big guns to fight

338
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,220
所以他们派大人物来了吗
because it's a hostile takeover?

339
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,220
我来这不是因为这是场恶意收购
I'm not here because it's a hostile takeover.

340
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,200
我来是因为整件事都是我的错
I'm here because this whole thing is my fault.

341
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,290
你的错  什么意思
What do you mean your fault?

342
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,240
你被当作目标物是因为
The reason you're in the crosshairs is because

343
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,380
丹尼尔・哈德曼要报复我
Daniel Hardman has a vendetta against me.

344
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,840
你是说  我们刚刚才做了一单
You're telling me we just closed a deal

345
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,380
保证公司未来前景的生意
that ensures this company's future

346
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,460
你就因为惹怒了前合伙人
and you put it in jeopardy because you pissed off

347
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,370
让我们又陷入了险境吗
your former partner?

348
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,550
是的  我就是这个意思
Yes, that's what I'm telling you.

349
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,050
该死的
God damn it.

350
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,630
你指望我怎么做  多米尼克
Well what do you want me to do, Dominic?

351
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,080
我想要你别再像个混蛋一样对待别人
I want you to stop being an asshole to people.

352
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,560
现在说那个太迟了
It's too late for that.

353
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,270
但这个可能还不迟
But it may not be too late for this.

354
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,430
别请我们做代理律师了
Drop us as your attorneys.

355
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,950
什么
What?

356
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,790
只要你跟我们有关系
As long as you're connected to us,

357
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,250
就会被当做攻击目标
there's gonna be a target on your back.

358
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,540
你跟我们撇清关系  可能就安全了
You let us go, there's a chance it goes away.

359
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,570
哈维
Harvey.

360
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,010
如果一有人恨你  我就要跟你撇清关系
If I was just gonna cut you loose because someone hates you,

361
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,870
那我从一开始就不会雇你
I wouldn't have hired you in the fist place,

362
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,170
因为我们都知道
because we both know

363
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,710
我曾经非常恨你
I used to hate you.

364
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,580
谢谢  多米尼克
Thanks, Dominic.

365
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,230
-我们要怎么办  -回头告诉你
- So what are we gonna do? - I'll let you know.

366
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,340
但我把话放在这
But I'll tell you this:

367
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,090
他们想开战  那就开战吧
they want a war, they got a war.

368
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,430
瑞秋  你有路易上个月的尼尔森案简报吗
Hey, Rach, do you have that Neilson brief for Louis from last month?

369
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,650
没有
No, I don't.

370
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,800
你确定吗  因为他一直告诉我在你这
Are you sure? Because he keeps telling me that you have it.

371
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,080
我也一直跟他说我没有
And I keep telling him I don't

372
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,330
我有比每天无所事事地待在这
and I have more important things to do

373
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,540
回答同一个问题更重要的事要做
than sit around and answer the same question every other day.

374
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,880
我也不需要浪费时间在这
And I have better things to do with my time

375
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,680
忍受你这种口气
than to be spoken to that way.

376
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,540
对不起
I'm sorry.

377
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,000
瑞秋  发生什么事了
Rachel, what's going on?

378
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,930
我刚跟我妈妈吃了午餐
I just had lunch with my mom

379
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,110
讨论婚礼的事  她想在《纽约时报》上
to talk about our wedding, and she wants to put

380
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,840
发表结婚通告
an announcement in "The New York Times."

381
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,750
天呐
Oh, my god.

382
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,180
你告诉她不能这么做了吗
Did you tell her that she can't do that?

383
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,750
是的  我编了个谎话说这太势利了
Yeah. I made up some story about it being snobby,

384
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,590
但是唐娜  这只是麻烦的冰山一角
but Donna, that's just the tip of the iceberg.

385
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,510
什么意思
What are you talking about?

386
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,500
这是她提议的宾客名单
This is her proposed guest list.

387
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,240
足有三百人  其中包括
It is 300 people and it includes

388
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,910
首席检察官和哈佛法学院院长
the attorney general and the dean of Harvard Law.

389
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,910
我要怎么办
What am I gonna do?

390
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,650
你得告诉她你不想要
You're gonna tell her that you don't want

391
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,320
太盛大的婚礼  就这样
a big wedding and that's that.

392
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,520
如果我这么说了  她察觉到不对劲的
And if I do that, she's gonna know that something's not right.

393
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,550
瑞秋  每对母女
Rachel, this is the type of argument

394
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,920
都会就婚礼
that every mother has with every daughter

395
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,200
产生这样的争论
about her wedding.

396
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,950
她永远不会想到迈克是冒牌的
She's never gonna think that Mike's a fraud.

397
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,600
-多米尼克反应如何  -还可以
- How'd Dominic take it? - He took it fine.

398
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,080
很好  因为我有计划了
Good, 'cause I have a plan.

399
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,770
说说看
Let's hear it.

400
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,060
我们去个他们绝对想不到的地方
We go to the last place they'd ever expect

401
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,520
-去提合并案  -哪里
- and we offer to merge. - Where?

402
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,320
弗莱彻引擎公司
Fletcher Engines.

403
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,240
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

404
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,800
我们去找弗莱彻  他们就会踢多米尼克出局
We go to Fletcher, they're gonna kick Dominic out,

405
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,170
杰克就上位了
Jack gains power.

406
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,860
还不如一开始就让麦肯诺被买断
Might as well have let Mckernon get bought out in the first place.

407
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,000
那么唯一有一丝可能的选择
Then the only other option that's even remotely possible

408
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,410
就是把它私有化
is we take them private.

409
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,630
这办法也许真的可行
That actually might work.

410
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,500
回头想想  你为什么不一开始
Come to think of it, why the hell didn't you

411
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,050
就跟我提出这个计划
just say that to me in the first place?

412
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,840
因为我知道不管我第一个主意是什么
Because I knew you'd shit on whatever my first idea was

413
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,100
你都会否决  然后考虑候补计划
and that you'd be open to the backup.

414
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,980
你是说你编了个幌子来操纵我
You're telling me you set up a straw man idea

415
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,200
让我支持你真正的计划
to manipulate me into liking your real idea?

416
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,640
-没错  -你玩这个花招多久了
- Yep. - How long you been doing that?

417
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,000
从皮博迪对丹索普一案起
Peabody versus Danthorpe.

418
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,670
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

419
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,570
好吧  小机灵
All right, smart guy.

420
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,200
我们去哪搞买股份的钱
Now where are we gonna get the money for the equity?

421
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,940
让我来告诉你  西德威尔和扬诺普洛斯
I'll tell you where. Sidwell and Gianopolous.

422
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,450
这又是个幌子吗
Is that another straw man idea?

423
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,780
因为你不可能让他们俩
Because you'll never get the two of them

424
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,200
合作商谈  他们互相讨厌
to go in on a deal together. They hate each other.

425
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,270
我就指望他们俩
Oh, those two hating each other is exactly

426
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,490
互相讨厌呢
what I'm counting on.

427
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,460
-妈妈  -瑞秋
- Hey, mom. - Oh, Rachel!

428
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,110
你来的正是时候
You're just in time.

429
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,330
酒席承办商送来了例菜
The caterer dropped off some samples.

430
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,450
我刚准备尝尝  但我们一起品尝
I was just about to try them, but it'll be much more fun

431
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,210
会有趣得多
if we do this together.

432
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,100
妈妈  在你倒酒之前
Okay, mom, but before you pour that.

433
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,540
我觉得脆面包片不太合适
I don't think that the crostini travels very well.

434
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,860
妈妈  拜托
Mom, please.

435
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,900
我知道你为此考虑了很久
I know that you have given this a lot of thought,

436
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,340
但我必须跟你谈谈婚礼的规模
but I need to talk to you about the size of the wedding.

437
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,720
这太盛大了
It's way too big.

438
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,410
我确实考虑了很久
I have given this a lot of thought,

439
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,720
只有三十个人的婚礼
and 30 people at a wedding

440
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,670
可请不到这样的厨师
isn't going to get a chef like this.

441
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,740
没错  但我才不会依着厨师办婚礼
Right, but I'm not having a wedding based on the chef,

442
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,420
我也不是来讨论菜单的
and I'm not here to talk about the menu.

443
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,330
我来是想谈谈宾客名单
I'm here to talk about the guest list.

444
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,280
瑞秋  我告诉过你在我们婚礼三周前
Rachel, did I ever tell you what your father did

445
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,980
你父亲做了什么吗
three weeks before we got married?

446
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,560
他买了两张去百慕大的机票  说我们要私奔
Bought two tickets to Bermuda and said we're eloping.

447
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,020
他那么做是因为他不想
And he did that because he didn't want

448
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,470
应付我的母亲
to deal with my mother.

449
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,360
但你知道什么阻止了我吗
But you know what stopped me?

450
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,440
我知道我一辈子都会后悔
I knew that I would regret doing that to my mom

451
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,850
对自己的母亲做了那样的事
for the rest of my life.

452
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,490
我告诉过你这与迈克无关
But I told you this isn't about Mike,

453
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,880
也不会有什么私奔
and it isn't about eloping.

454
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,100
只是因为我不想
This is just about me not wanting to get married

455
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,710
在数百个陌生人的面前结婚
in front of hundreds of people that I don't know.

456
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,310
到底怎么回事  瑞秋
What's going on here, Rachel?

457
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,440
我都告诉你了
I'm telling you what's going on.

458
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,330
你就是听不进去
You're just not hearing me.

459
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,700
我不想把婚礼搞得这么隆重
I don't want this big of a wedding.

460
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,870
我听明白了  但我了解我自己的女儿
I'm hearing you, but I know my own daughter,

461
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,030
你有事情瞒着我
and there is something that you're not telling me.

462
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,770
好吧  妈妈
Okay, mom.

463
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,710
没错  我确实有事没告诉你
Yes, there is something that I'm not telling you,

464
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,500
因为这件事真的很难开口
and that's because it's really hard for me to say it.

465
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,130
你总觉得这是因为迈克
You keep thinking that this is about Mike.

466
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,690
其实不是
Well, it's not.

467
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,380
是因为你不肯接受这是我的婚礼
This is about you not accepting that it's

468
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,200
不是你的婚礼这个事实
my wedding and it's not yours.

469
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,340
-瑞秋  -如果你不想办法接受这点
- Rachel. - And if you can't figure out a way to accept that,

470
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,960
那我觉得我俩还是私奔吧
then I think maybe we will have to elope.

471
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,930
杰西卡  能跟你谈谈吗
Jessica, can I talk to you for a second?

472
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,080
能等明天再说吗
Can it wait till tomorrow?

473
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,240
不行
No.

474
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,800
我觉得我们应该提拔
I think we should consider promoting

475
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,350
杰克・索罗夫做冠名合伙人
Jack Soloff to name partner.

476
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,590
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

477
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,630
杰西卡  现在兵临城下
Jessica, we are under attack.

478
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,180
而你却让我奖赏我们的敌人
And you're asking me to reward our enemy.

479
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,890
不  我是让你把敌人的左膀右臂
No, I'm asking you to bring our enemy's right hand

480
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,860
拉拢到我们这边
over to our side.

481
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,640
路易  时候不早了  我要回家了
Louis, it's late. I'm going home.

482
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,540
杰西卡  你得听我说  求你了
Jessica, you have to listen to me, please.

483
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,260
哈德曼手上有他的把柄
Hardman's got something on him.

484
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,130
什么把柄
Has what on him?

485
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,970
不知道  但两个月前
I don't know, but until two months ago,

486
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,500
我们对杰克・索罗夫的印象还停留在
the only thing we knew about Jack Soloff

487
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,570
他是除我以外计费工时最多的律师
is that he bills more hours than anyone but me.

488
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,200
你觉得他会某天早上醒来
So, what, you think he just woke up one day

489
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,800
突然就变成了政变的幕后主使吗
and became mastermind of a palace coup?

490
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,510
问题的关键不是他们俩谁说了算
The question isn't who's in charge between those two,

491
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,530
而是杰克是自愿的
it's whether Jack is a volunteer

492
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,550
还是被迫的
or a conscription.

493
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,740
我告诉你  我跟他谈过了
I'm telling you, I talked to him.

494
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,170
他做这一切都是被逼无奈
He's doing all this staring down the barrel of a gun.

495
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,690
那么让杰克当上冠名合伙人
Then putting Jack's name on the door

496
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,100
只能给丹尼尔更大的权力
only gives Daniel more power.

497
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,940
你说什么
What are you saying?

498
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,570
如果哈德曼有他的把柄
If Hardman has something on him,

499
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,580
那我们也要抓到他的把柄
then we need to have it on him too.

500
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,780
所以你与其跑来建议我提拔他
So instead of telling me that we should promote him,

501
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,530
不如去找找他的把柄
why don't you get to work on that?

502
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,330
我以为上次谈话时  我已经说的很明白了
I thought I made it clear last time we talked

503
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,020
你说什么我都不感兴趣
I'm not interested in whatever you're selling.

504
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,970
这份你一定会感兴趣的
Well, you're gonna be interested in this.

505
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,730
你摆在我面前的任何交易
There is no deal you're gonna put in front of my face

506
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,630
都不可能让我想跟你合作的
that's gonna make me want to get in business with you.

507
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,650
这不是为了让你跟我做交易
You're not doing it to get in business with me.

508
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,960
而是为了避免我
You're doing it to keep me

509
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,220
跟托尼・扬诺普洛斯做交易
from getting into business with Tony Gianopolous.

510
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,760
因为此时此刻  哈维正在他那里
'Cause, right now, Harvey is over there

511
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,950
向他提出同样的交易
pitching him the same deal.

512
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,750
你以为我在乎哈维・斯佩克特做了什么交易吗
And you think I give a shit what deals Harvey Specter does?

513
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,320
我认为你在乎乔纳森・西德威尔做了什么交易
I think you give a shit what deals Jonathan Sidwell does.

514
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,090
你是来挑拨我俩
And you're here to pit us against each other

515
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,390
好提高价格
just to jack up the price.

516
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,350
说得没错
Damn right I am.

517
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,580
那么你现在就可以走了
Then you can walk your ass out that door right now.

518
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,810
因为我敢保证
Because I guarantee you

519
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,190
西德威尔也是这么对哈维说的
that's what Sidwell's telling Harvey.

520
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,730
哈维正告诉他  你们两个中的一个
And what Harvey's telling him is that one of you

521
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,800
明天会在财经频道上宣布自己的新交易
is gonna be on CNBC tomorrow announcing their new deal...

522
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,010
而另一个将两手空空
And the other one's going to be left with nothing

523
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,000
一无所有
but his dick in his hand,

524
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,790
如何选择取决于你
so, it's up to you.

525
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,310
但先签协议的那个
But whoever calls first is gonna have it

526
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,230
将会压过另一个人一辈子
over the other one for the rest of their life.

527
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,400
时间紧迫啊  托尼
Clock's ticking, Tony.

528
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,390
我收到短信  他就赢了
I get a text, he beats you to the punch.

529
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,840
我立马走人
I walk out that door.

530
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,550
你的决定是什么
So, what's it gonna be?

531
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,520
你真是个混蛋
You're a son of a bitch.

532
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,860
我喜欢
I like that.

533
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,300
我加入
I'm in.

534
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,690
我加入
I'm in.

535
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,060
不不  听着  我不在乎他们什么时候需要
No, no, listen. I don't care when they need it.

536
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,870
我每天有十五分钟早餐时间
I get 15 minutes a day to eat my breakfast

537
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,540
可是今天早上没吃成
and I didn't get it this morning.

538
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,880
我刚刚重新加热了我的麦满分
Okay? I just reheated my Egg McMuffin

539
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,070
我现在要安安静静把它吃完
and I'm going to eat it in peace.

540
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,420
你好  小美人
Hello, beautiful.

541
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,700
终于只剩你跟我了
Finally, it's just you and me.

542
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,040
巴纳比  对吧
Barnaby, right?

543
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,920
其实我叫本杰明  我现在...
Actually, it's Benjamin, and I'm kind of on--

544
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,240
我不在乎你在干什么
Oh, I don't care what you're on.

545
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,290
我需要你手上所有关于杰克・索罗夫的资料
I need everything you have on Jack Soloff.

546
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,270
我不明白你的意思
I don't know what that means.

547
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,010
我需要一份
It means that I need a detailed account

548
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,330
他入职至今经手的所有案件的清单
of all the cases he's worked on since he started here.

549
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,240
这是档案室的工作  所以...
Well, that's really more of a file room issue, so--

550
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,950
班森  我要是想去档案室
Hey, Benson, if I wanted to go to the file room,

551
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,290
我就去档案室了
I'd go to god damn file room,

552
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,420
但我没去  因为我还需要所有的工资记录
but I don't because I also want all billing records,

553
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,110
通话记录  私人邮件
phone records, personal e-mails--

554
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,750
私人邮件也要吗
Whoa, personal e-mails?

555
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,490
没错  就算是进行了前列腺检查
Yes. If he scheduled a prostate exam,

556
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,810
也要告诉我
I want to know about it.

557
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,690
这不是每年体检的一项吗
Isn't that just part of the annual checkup?

558
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,510
你哪根葱  卫生局长吗  让你做你就做
What are you, C. Everett Coop? Just get it done.

559
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,840
下次我再让你做什么
And the next time I ask you to do something,

560
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,400
你照做就行  少问蠢问题
do it without asking any stupid questions,

561
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,250
明白了吗
you got it?

562
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,570
迈克・罗斯总会给我带吃的
You know, Mike Ross always brings me food.

563
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,700
什么
What?

564
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,100
我是说  迈克需要我帮忙的时候
I'm just saying, whenever Michael needs a favor,

565
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,020
总会给我带点东西
He brings me something.

566
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,030
比如一袋热培根
You know, like, a warm bag of bacon

567
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,980
或者炸薯条
or french fries.

568
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,600
这不是帮我的忙  这他妈是你的工作
This isn't a favor. This is your god damn job.

569
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,400
赶紧把我要的东西整理好
So get me what I ask for pronto

570
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,190
否则下次我会给你带一袋热翔
or the next time I'll stop by and bring you a warm bag of shit.

571
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,300
现在我连麦满分都不想吃了
And now I don't even want my Egg McMuffin.

572
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,030
唐娜  你有时间吗
Hey, Donna, do you have a second?

573
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,820
当然
Of course.

574
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,220
瑞秋  怎么了
Rachel, what's wrong?

575
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,860
我昨晚跟我妈妈谈过了
I talked to my mom last night.

576
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,750
看来不太顺利
And I take it it didn't go well.

577
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,310
糟透了  我威胁她说要私奔
No, it went horribly, and I threatened to elope.

578
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,720
瑞秋  没事的
Rachel, it's okay.

579
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,380
我们不是谈过吗
Look, we talked about this.

580
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,000
让她觉得你固执
If she's thinking that You're being difficult,

581
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,080
这样她就不会发觉有别的原因
then she's not thinking something else is going on.

582
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,820
是的  可是她看得出来我有事瞒着她
No, no, but she could tell that I'm hiding something

583
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,740
我只好坐在那里骗她
and I had to sit there and lie to her and...

584
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,190
把错都推到她身上
and tell her that it was her fault.

585
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,960
瑞秋  她不会知道迈克的事
Rachel, she's not going to know about Mike.

586
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,580
你不明白
You don't get it.

587
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,800
我在考虑告诉我妈妈真相
I'm thinking about telling my mom the truth.

588
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,400
瑞秋  这不是好主意
Rachel, that is a bad idea.

589
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,200
你妈妈接受得了
Your mom can get over some spat

590
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,090
你对婚礼规模的抱怨
about the size of your wedding,

591
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,950
可她接受不了这个
but she's not going to get over this.

592
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,470
我只知道  我妈妈无论如何都会爱我
All I know is, my mom loves me no matter what.

593
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,050
我理解  但是瑞秋
I understand that, but Rachel,

594
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,940
如果你这么做了
if you do this,

595
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,630
你会让你母亲背负上
you're going to be burdening your mother

596
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,960
一个一生都要
with a secret that she has to keep

597
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,100
对你父亲隐瞒的秘密
from your father for the rest of her life.

598
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,020
你俩怎么进来的
How did you two get in here?

599
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,930
你让我们看到了  你能去我们那里撒野
You showed us you can get to us.

600
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,180
现在你该知道我们也可以来你这里
Now you know we can get to you.

601
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,100
你们一定是来把麦肯诺汽车公司
Then you must be here to hand me the keys

602
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,060
交给我的
to McKernon Motors.

603
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,140
其实  我们是来通知你
Actually, we're here to inform you

604
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,180
麦肯诺汽车公司要转私有了
that McKernon Motors is going private.

605
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,840
那挺好  但问题在于
That's all well and good, but there's the matter

606
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,640
我还是可以投标  最后决定要股东投票
of my tender offer, which is up to the shareholders

607
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,620
而我手里有五分之一股权
and my 20% is voting to take it.

608
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,380
恭喜
Good for you.

609
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,150
我们十分确定剩下五分之四
We're pretty sure the other 80%

610
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,840
都会选择我们的投标  因为
is gonna want to take our offer, seeing as it is

611
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,660
我们的比你的每股高十美元
ten dollars per share higher than yours.

612
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,780
胡扯
Bullshit.

613
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,570
你们哪来的钱
Where'd you get that kind of money?

614
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,030
从想让你滚蛋回泽西联合银行取的
We got it at the united bank of take your ass back to Jersey.

615
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,530
所以想找麻烦请你尽管来  丹尼尔
So, you can keep coming after us all you want, Daniel,

616
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,510
但是结果都会是这样的
but they're all going to end up just like this.

617
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,020
那我就提价
Then I'm going to raise my offer.

618
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,200
每股十美元  因为如果你俩认为
Ten dollars a share, because if you two think

619
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,430
你们能高过我  那你们就错了
you can beat me, you can't.

620
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,430
-跟你说了的吧  -说了什么
- Told you. - Told him what?

621
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,250
那是你的最高价了
That was your ceiling.

622
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,790
他还以为你能每股涨15美元呢
He thought it was 15 a share more.

623
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,790
我以为你还有更大的本事呢
I thought you had bigger balls.

624
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,140
不管怎样  我们只是想知道
Either way, we just wanted to find out

625
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,670
你的封顶是多少以便高出你的
what it was so we could come over the top

626
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,580
粉碎你的计划
and crush you.

627
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,060
因为我们的真实出价是每股涨二十
Because our real offer is 20 more per share

628
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,610
我们也不在乎你的投资人是谁
and we don't care who your investor is,

629
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,280
他们绝无可能出比这高的价
there's no way they're paying more than that

630
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,900
就为了替你报私仇
just to fund your grudge.

631
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,140
回见了  丹尼尔
See you around, Daniel.

632
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,410
对了  迈克在你的盆栽里小便来着
By the way, Mike pissed in your bonsai.

633
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,430
没错  两次
Yeah, that's right. Two times.

634
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,950
顺便说句  引用《非常嫌疑犯》
By the way, nice usual suspects reference

635
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,570
-干的真漂亮  -你听出来啦
- back there. - Really, you caught that?

636
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,340
我当然听出来了  你以为我傻吗
Yeah, I caught it. What do you think I am?

637
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,630
没有  只是以为你听不懂的
Nothing, I just didn't think you'd get it.

638
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,470
我说的很隐晦呀
It was so subtle.

639
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,020
相信我  一点都不隐晦
Trust me, not so subtle.

640
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,440
要真像你说的那么笨拙  那你当时
Well, if it was so ham-fisted, why didn't you just

641
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,030
干嘛不直接戳穿
chime in back there?

642
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,100
因为我是去跟哈德曼宣战
Because I was there to stick it to hardman,

643
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,400
不是为了用暗语和你胡闹的
not clown around with some quote-fest.

644
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,520
这就是我们的区别了
That's the difference between you and me.

645
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,880
两样我可以同时做到
I can do both at the same time.

646
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,060
是吗  以你的年龄
Really? See, at your age,

647
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,900
之前我一直很惊奇你能不去尿尿
I'm surprised that you can even make it through a meeting

648
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,290
一气儿开那么长的会呢
that long without having to pee.

649
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,590
你看  你怎么就非得直白到前列腺上去
Okay, why do you always have to go straight to the prostate?

650
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,930
多么不雅
It's so distasteful.

651
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,110
是吗  那你告诉哈德曼
Oh, right. And you telling Hardman

652
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,470
我在他盆栽里尿尿就能登大雅之堂了
that I'd peed in his bonsai was just pure class.

653
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,380
我可没说你在他盆栽里尿尿了
I didn't say you peed in his bonsai.

654
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,670
我说的是你在盆栽里解手了  你还五岁吗
I said you pissed in it. What are you, five?

655
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,010
还有  是你自己跟他说
And by the way, you're the one who told him

656
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,920
尿了两次的
you did it twice.

657
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,180
因为你已经起头了
Because you started it.

658
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,420
我只好附和你  这叫做有行动力
I had to lean in. It's called committing.

659
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,300
那不如你行动一下  去买下
Then how about you commit to buying the next round

660
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,240
一轮酒吧
for a change?

661
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,200
我是很乐意  但今天不行
I'd love to, but I can't.

662
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,350
我得去瑞秋的妈妈家和她见面
I got to go meet Rachel at her mom's.

663
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,820
谈谈婚礼的事宜
Talk about some wedding stuff.

664
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,500
我很乐意同去
I'd love to join you,

665
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,260
但我宁愿去做前列腺检查
but I'd rather have a prostate exam.

666
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,370
这就对了
There you go.

667
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,650
看吧  你也学会了
See? You're leaning in.

668
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,500
我为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

669
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,940
抱歉  女士  能不能麻烦你
Excuse me, ma'am, could you make sure

670
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,930
等他嘀咕现在都拍不出《欢迎回来科特》
to cut him off when he starts mumbling about

671
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,960
这种好剧的时候
how they don't make shows like

672
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,480
就别让他继续喝了
Welcome Back Cotter anymore?

673
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,440
你来干什么  丹尼尔
What are you doing here, Daniel?

674
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,370
在考虑把这墙漆成什么颜色
Just wondering what color to paint the walls.

675
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,140
从来就不喜欢红色
I've never been partial to red.

676
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,080
你来评论我办公室的墙色
Instead of commenting on my wall color,

677
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,960
还不如回你自己办公室去
why don't you go back to your office?

678
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,600
舔舔自己的伤口
Lick your wounds.

679
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,230
什么伤口  我都要胜利了
What wounds? I'm about to win.

680
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,340
你对胜利的定义真不同常人
You have a funny definition of win.

681
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,620
因为我们刚刚击败了你的最高报价
Since we just blew your best offer out of the water.

682
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,470
这是我新报价的复印件
Here's a copy of my new offer.

683
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,830
明天就会上日报
It'll be in "The Journal" tomorrow.

684
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,920
这交易绝对叫不到这个价
There's no way the deal holds up under this price.

685
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,750
一旦你的委托人想通
And once your client figures that out,

686
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,710
你的投标也就流产了
your offer falls through.

687
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,890
幸运的是  我的委托人是日本人
Well, then lucky for me, my client's Japanese

688
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,240
美元对日元刚刚大幅贬值
and the dollar just took a dive against the yen.

689
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,050
所以我的投标万无一失
So my deal will hold up and then some.

690
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,420
我才不在乎你的委托人是哪里人
You know, I don't give a shit where your client's from.

691
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,000
我绝不会输给你
I don't lose to you.

692
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,010
你会的
Yes you do.

693
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,960
因为这次交易后  还会有下一个
Because after this deal, there'll be another one

694
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,230
再下一个  和再再下一个
and another one and another one,

695
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,600
因为是你夺走了我的律所  而现在
because you took my firm from me and I'm going to take it

696
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,090
我会把它抢回来
right back from you.

697
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,890
滚出我的办公室  丹尼尔
Get the hell out of my office, Daniel,

698
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,630
在我做出让你后悔的事以前
before I do something you'll regret.

699
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,170
提到墙
Speaking of walls,

700
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,200
四周的墙都向你压过来的感觉如何啊
how does it feel to have them closing in on you?

701
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,490
混蛋
Son of a bitch!

702
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,120
路易  出事了吗
Louis, is something wrong?

703
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:38,990
看到了吗
See this?

704
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,500
这里面是世界上能找到的
It contains everything on god's green earth

705
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,620
关于杰克・爱德华・索罗夫的所有资料
there is to know about Jack Edward Soloff

706
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,010
从他倒霉的八字胡到
from his pirate beard to his stupid pen

707
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,220
他莱纳斯绒毯一样四处显摆的白痴钢笔
that he carries around like linus's blanket.

708
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,590
-结果  -结果完全找不到他的把柄
- And...? - And there's no dirt on him!

709
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,710
没有一个案子他办的不合法
There's not one case he crossed a line on.

710
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,730
没有债务  什么都没有
There's no debts. Nothing.

711
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,110
路易
Louis.

712
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,980
听到我的话了吗  如果索罗夫有把柄
Did you hear me? Is Soloff did something

713
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,700
而哈德曼也知道  那这事埋得太深了
and Hardman's a part of it, it is buried so deep,

714
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,330
让我们连蛛丝马迹都找不到
we'll never even see the top of it,

715
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,090
跟别说追查到底了
let alone get to the bottom of it.

716
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,910
路易  我得给你说一件我原本
Louis, I'm about to tell you something I never

717
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,580
-不打算告诉你的事  -什么事
- thought I would. - What?

718
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,960
哈维和迈克合力想出办法对付
The night that Harvey and Mike put it together

719
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,710
丹尼尔和科斯特尔那晚
about Daniel and CM,

720
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,590
他们嗑药了
they got stoned first.

721
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,850
什么
What?

722
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,900
他们以为你和丹尼尔胜券在握他们已经
They thought you and daniel had them and they were screwed

723
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,340
没法翻盘了就想  管他呢
and they figured, "What the hell?"

724
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,330
所以他们买了大麻嗑了药
So they bought some marijuana and they got high.

725
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,500
你是建议我们现在去买大麻吗
Are you suggesting we take the pot?

726
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,150
对他们就有用啊
Worked for them.

727
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,290
那对我没用
Well, it's not gonna work for me.

728
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,260
-路易  -唐娜  看着我
- Louis-- - Donna, look at me.

729
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,520
你觉得我是需要拥抱和偏执
Do I look like someone who needs to be hungry

730
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,130
-来做事的人吗  -镇定
- and paranoid? - Relax.

731
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,370
我只是提个建议
It was just a suggestion.

732
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,160
那我告诉你这建议很蠢
Well it was a stupid god damn suggestion,

733
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,360
如果你就这一个办法  那你可以滚了
and if that's all you have, just walk you ass out of here.

734
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,230
路易  你怎么啦  干嘛生我的气呀
Louis, what is going on? Why are you so angry at me?

735
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,520
我不是生你的气
I'm not angry at you.

736
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,240
-我是气我自己  -路易
- I'm angry at myself. - Louis.

737
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,070
投票后  哈维跟我说这是我的错
After the vote, Harvey told me it was my fault

738
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,560
知道问题在哪吗  他是对的
and you want to know what? He's right.

739
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,320
哈维说了那么多话
Harvey says a lot of things.

740
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,330
-你也跟我说了  -说什么了
- You told me too. - What?

741
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,000
这件事就是因我而起  因为我告诉了杰克
This whole thing started because I told Jack

742
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,700
他可以把哈维的佣金提出来投个票
that he could bring up harvey's compensation

743
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,750
而你劝阻我来着
for a vote, and you told me not to.

744
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,960
那也许这事也有我的错
Well, then maybe it's my fault too.

745
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,480
因为这件事最根本的起因是
Because this whole thing really started when you tried

746
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,920
你想弥补哈维因为
to make things right with Harvey for

747
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,900
我来为你工作闹的矛盾
me coming to work for you.

748
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,260
唐娜  你是在说你后悔来为我工作了吗
Donna, are you saying that you regret coming to me?

749
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,300
不  路易  我是说也许
No, louis. I'm saying maybe

750
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,990
这事也有我的责任
I had a hand in this too.

751
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,250
现在我们怎么办
What do we do now?

752
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,870
我们一起继续找办法
We keep looking together.

753
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,590
如果找不到  那就告诉杰西卡事实
And if we can't find anything, then we tell Jessica the truth.

754
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,620
劳拉  你好
Laura, hi, how are you?

755
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,700
瑞秋呢  我以为她肯定
Where's Rachel, I thought for sure

756
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,840
会比我早到的
she'd beat me here.

757
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,100
瑞秋不来了
Uh, Rachel's not coming.

758
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,950
我跟她说我有点不舒服
I told her I wasn't feeling well

759
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,690
因为我想跟你单独谈谈
because I wanted to talk to you alone.

760
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,860
出什么事了吗
Is something wrong?

761
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,760
的确
Yes, there is.

762
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,060
瑞秋今天跟我说
Rachel told me today that

763
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,240
她想缩小婚礼的规模
she wants to scale back the wedding

764
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,980
还说这是你们一致决定的
and that you two are in sync on this.

765
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,680
听起来你好像不相信她
Sounds like you don't believe her.

766
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,160
她竟然都不想在《纽约时报》上
Found it hard enough to believe that she wouldn't

767
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,900
结婚通告  这实在让我难以相信
want to put an announcement in "The Times,"

768
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,100
要知道  我的宝贝女儿  可是一直想要
But that my little girl, who always dreamed

769
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,340
在广场酒店举行婚礼的
of getting married at the Plaza Hotel

770
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,860
现在却只要个小型简单的婚礼就好
now only wants a handful of people there?

771
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,510
抱歉  迈克
I'm sorry, Michael.

772
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,510
我不会相信的
I just don't buy it.

773
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,660
这是你的主意  对吗
This is coming from you, isn't it?

774
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,900
被你说中了
You're right.

775
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,920
是我的主意
It is.

776
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,530
让我来告诉你原因
And I'll tell you why.

777
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,360
我没有家人
I don't have a family.

778
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,140
我也没有那么多可以邀请的宾客
I don't have a lot of people that I can invite,

779
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,050
所以我问她是不是可以
and I asked her if we could please

780
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,740
办一个低调点的婚礼
keep the entire wedding low-key.

781
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,780
她说她愿意为了我而牺牲
And she said that she would do that for me.

782
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,500
这我能够理解
And I understand that.

783
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,270
我也觉得她愿意这样为你
I think it's incredibly sweet of her

784
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,370
也真是贴心
to be willing to do that for you.

785
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,420
但是
But...

786
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,450
如果你能主动自愿地
if you could find it in your heart

787
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,820
给我的宝贝女儿一个
to let my little girl have the wedding

788
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,470
她梦寐以求的婚礼  我告诉你
that she's always wanted, I am telling you,

789
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,600
她这一生都不会忘记
she'll remember it for the rest of her life.

790
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,740
又来
Again?

791
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,380
我真的觉得还不如我直接给你把钥匙
You know, I'd really prefer it if I gave you a key

792
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,400
这样我就不用去想你到底是怎么进来的了
so I wouldn't have to wonder how you keep getting in.

793
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,270
我也真心觉得还不如你有事儿没事儿
And I'd really prefer it if you checked your cell phone

794
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,620
就看下手机  也就不用我
every once in a while so that I wouldn't

795
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,650
一直私闯民宅了
have to keep doing this.

796
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,680
-我有手机吗  -有啊
- I have a cell phone? - You do

797
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,030
如果你看了  你就知道丹尼尔・哈德曼
and if you'd check it, you'd know that Daniel Hardman

798
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,740
比我们的竞价高了20%
topped our bid by 20%.

799
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,510
-不可能  -事实如此
- That's impossible. - No, it isn't.

800
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,450
因为美元兑日元的汇率又跌了
Because the dollar took a dive against the yen

801
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,000
而他的客户原来是日本人
and it turns out his client is Japanese.

802
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,120
该死  我们不能输给
God damn it, we are not losing

803
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,040
那个狗日的
to that son of a bitch.

804
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,420
当然  不然你觉得我是为什么来的
Why the hell did you think I'm here?

805
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,410
我们得回去找扬诺普洛斯  争取更多的钱
We need to go back to Gianopolous and get more money.

806
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,620
杰西卡  他不会掏这么多的
Jessica, he's not going to pay that much.

807
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,840
是个脑子正常的人就不会
No one in his right mind would.

808
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,370
那就去找个脑子不正常的人
Then go to somebody who's not in his right mind,

809
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,750
因为那个满嘴假话的混蛋  不把他的名字写回墙上
because that lying bastard isn't going to stop

810
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,480
是不会善罢甘休的
until his name is back up on the wall.

811
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,310
你等等  美元兑日元的汇率下跌
Wait a second, the dollar took a dive

812
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,270
是两周前的事了
against the yen two weeks ago.

813
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,650
说明这里面还有内幕
Which means there's something else going on here.

814
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,220
我来告诉你内幕是什么
Oh, I'll tell you what's going on.

815
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,760
哈德曼一直在玩我们呢
Hardman's been playing with us this whole time.

816
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,840
你在说什么
What are you saying?

817
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,640
我说我得去见个人问点事情
I'm saying I need to go see a guy about a thing.

818
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,970
你去哪儿了
Where were you?

819
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,030
-我去见你妈妈了  -什么
- I was with your mom. - What?

820
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,100
你没收到短信吗  她要推迟跟我们的见面
Didn't you get the message? She had to postpone.

821
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,800
她没推迟  瑞秋  她给我来了个突然袭击
She didn't postpone, Rachel. She blindsided me.

822
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,140
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

823
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,790
你怎么不告诉我你在跟她吵架
Why didn't you tell me you were fighting with her?

824
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,150
因为妈妈跟女儿本来就会为了婚礼吵架啊
Because mothers and daughters fight about weddings

825
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,820
没什么大不了的
all the time.

826
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,020
但你吵的不是婚礼的事
But you weren't fighting about the wedding.

827
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,230
而是我的秘密
You were fighting about my secret.

828
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,560
那又有什么关系
And what does that have to do with anything?

829
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,960
可是她不知道
Because she doesn't even know it.

830
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,560
因为我想要保护你
Because I'm trying to protect you.

831
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,250
我懂  但这些事你总要
I understand that, but you have to share

832
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,520
-跟我说说  -为什么
- these things with me. - Why?

833
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,160
因为你不但没保护到我
'Cause instead of protecting me,

834
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,370
还把我坑苦了
you hung me out to dry.

835
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,950
此话怎讲
And how exactly did I do that?

836
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,330
你弄的像是我夺走了
By making it seem like I'm the one

837
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,910
你的梦幻婚礼一样
that's taking away your dream wedding.

838
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,270
本来就是你夺走了我的梦幻婚礼
You are the one taking away my dream wedding.

839
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,270
瑞秋
Rachel.

840
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,270
抱歉
I'm sorry.

841
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,310
实在是  太多事了
It's just, it's a lot,

842
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,720
她还想在《纽约时报》上发结婚通告
and she wanted to make this announcement

843
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,390
然后又有长长的宾客名单
in "The New York Times" and had this huge guest list

844
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,480
还要请哈佛法学院的院长  我只是
and the dean of Harvard Law and I just--

845
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,630
我不想你被抓
I don't want you to get caught.

846
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,260
你是不想我被抓
You don't want me to get caught

847
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,550
还是你不想嫁给我
or you don't want to marry me?

848
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:13,970
什么
What?

849
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,550
我去见克莱尔了
I went to see Claire.

850
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,460
我知道她知道的
I know she knows.

851
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,760
我想知道的是  那有没有
And I want to know if that made you

852
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,440
让你对我们的事  有所犹豫
have second thoughts about us.

853
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,410
你去见克莱尔了  为什么
You went to see Claire? Why...

854
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,370
你为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me that?

855
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,850
因为她跟我说  如果我真的爱你
Because she told me that if I really loved you,

856
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,180
我就不该娶你
I wouldn't marry you.

857
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,100
我不敢告诉你
And I was afraid to tell you that

858
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,230
是因为我怕你也是这么想的
because I thought maybe you feel the same way.

859
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,990
好吧  但是
Well, it, um,

860
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,050
看来有所犹豫的人好像是你吧
It sounds like you're the one who's having second thoughts.

861
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,220
我没有
No.

862
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,900
我没有过一丝的犹豫
No, I'm not having second thoughts,

863
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,760
但我真的很恨这种感觉  觉得我是在
but I do hate the idea that I am somehow dragging

864
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,790
拖你下水  还是滩可能会毁了你人生的浑水
you into something that is gonna ruin your life.

865
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,250
你没有拖我下任何东西
You are not dragging me into anything

866
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,190
你也没有毁了我的人生  迈克
and you're not ruining my life, Mike.

867
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,380
我不在乎广场酒店  也不在乎宾客有谁
I don't care about the Plaza or who comes or--

868
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,390
那些我都不在乎
I don't care about any of it.

869
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,390
我唯一在乎的是
The only thing that matters to me is that

870
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,300
我要嫁的人是你
the man that I'm marrying is you.

871
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,510
要是你连这一点都剥夺了的话
And if you take that away from me,

872
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,260
我真的
I don't--

873
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,240
瑞秋  瑞秋  听着  看着我  看着我
Rachel, Rachel, listen, look at me, look at me.

874
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,320
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

875
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,860
好吗  我们要结婚了
Okay? We're getting married.

876
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,770
婚礼就小办一场
And it could be as small as possible

877
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,790
只请我们的亲朋好友  好吗
with just our close friends, okay?

878
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,660
-好吗  -好
- Okay? - Okay.

879
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,420
我得跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

880
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,110
怎么了  路易
What is it, Louis?

881
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,270
我找不到杰克被哈德曼握在手里的把柄
I couldn't find what Hardman has on Jack.

882
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,760
这不应该是你在电梯边上等着
That doesn't sound like something you needed

883
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,450
要告诉我的事儿
to be waiting by the elevators to tell me.

884
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,020
我一直在想  要是我们告诉他
I've been thinking. What if we tell him

885
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,870
要做冠名合伙人  他就得先公开表示
we'll only make him name partner if he takes a public stand

886
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,690
反对丹尼尔  这样的话  就算他
against Daniel first? That way, even if he tries

887
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,790
以后再反对  也没有用了
to go against it later, it won't work.

888
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,260
那你跟他说过了吗
Did you speak to him about this?

889
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,060
-说了  -然后呢
- I have. - And?

890
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,120
他说他愿意
He said he'll be on board.

891
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,030
杰西卡
And Jessica,

892
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,700
我相信他
I believe him.

893
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,960
那告诉他下班后来见我
Then tell him to come see me at the end of the day.

894
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,810
结果我还是要结婚了
Turns out I'm getting married.

895
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,160
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know.

896
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,540
我跟我未来的丈母娘说
I was telling my future mother-in-law

897
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,640
我既没朋友也没家人
about how I didn't have any friends or any family

898
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:40,950
那时候我意识到
when I realized,

899
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,460
不管我们之间发生了什么
whatever happened between you and me...

900
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,920
你对我来说  不是家人  却胜似家人
You're the closest thing to family that I have.

901
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,670
我们见一面怎么样
So what do you say we get together?

902
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,760
-你想见我  -是的
- You wanted to see me? - I did.

903
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,690
我只是想说
I, uh... I just want to say,

904
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,470
基于路易说的  就是你已经准备好了要
based on what Louis said that you're prepared to do--

905
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,310
路易不知道我准备做什么
Louis has no idea what I'm prepared to do

906
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,900
因为我唯一准备做的事情
because the only thing I'm prepared to do

907
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,390
就是给你个机会向耶稣坦诚
is give you a chance to come to Jesus.

908
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,250
而你现在正面对她本人
And you're looking at her.

909
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,340
向耶稣坦诚什么
Come to Jesus about what?

910
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,280
别玩花样了  杰克
Stop tap dancing, Jack.

911
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,270
丹尼尔・哈德曼掌握了你什么把柄
What the hell does Daniel Hardman have on you?

912
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,740
你可以把那个问题问一百万次
You can ask me that question a million times.

913
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,890
但我绝对不会承认所谓把柄存在
I'm never even going to acknowledge its premise.

914
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,020
你刚承认了
And you just did.

915
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,420
如果事情有那么糟  而丹尼尔知道
And if it's that bad, and Daniel knows it

916
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,610
我却不知道
and I don't,

917
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,780
那我就只有一个选择
then I only have one choice.

918
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,870
下面就是我现在要做的事
So, what I'm prepared to do now is this.

919
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,620
你今晚辞职  我免除你的竞业限制
Resign tonight and I'll waive your non-compete.

920
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,360
-你说什么  -你不会真的以为
- What? - Oh, you didn't actually think

921
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,210
我会让你当冠名合伙人吧
I was going to make you a name partner, did you?

922
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,100
那我的回应是
Here's my counter.

923
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,760
你辞职  我免除你的竞业限制
You resign, and I waive your non-compete.

924
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,740
你想让我走  召集投票去
You want me gone, call for a vote.

925
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,570
你想让我走  也得召集投票
You want me gone, you do the same thing

926
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,290
因为我跟你一样是合伙人
because I'm a partner as much as you

927
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,070
而你是陷入困境的那个
and you're the one on the ropes.

928
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,790
我什么也没陷入
I'm not on shit,

929
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,430
因为我们知道丹尼尔的投资人是怎么回事
because we know what's going on with Daniel's investor

930
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,610
而哈维正在去解决问题
and Harvey's about to put a stop to it right now.

931
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,530
如果你真的知道
If you really knew what was going on

932
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,630
丹尼尔跟他的投资人是怎么回事
between Daniel and his investor,

933
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,010
你就该知道永远不可能
you'd know it's never gonna happen.

934
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,050
那我猜我们只能走着瞧了
Then I guess we'll just have to see what we see.....

935
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:04,230
哈维・斯佩克特  真是惊喜
Harvey Specter. What a nice surprise.

936
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,820
想来一局吗
Wanna play a little pool?

937
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,750
我们这边一局一万
We go for 10,000 a game in here.

938
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,990
你买丹尼尔・哈德曼为你抛头露面
You're playing a lot more expensive game than that,

939
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,020
那游戏玩得比这大多了
funding daniel hardman to be your frontman.

940
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,180
我很欢迎你来证明
And you're welcome to go ahead and prove that,

941
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,540
但他在我两年后离开这里前
but he's got full power of attorney

942
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,350
有全权代理权
until I get out of here in two years.

943
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,250
我不在乎你还有多少年
Yeah, I don't care how many years you have left.

944
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,870
无论多久那都是你最后的日子了
It's about to feel like the rest of your life,

945
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,840
因为这是你要去的地方
because this is where you're gonna spend it.

946
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,110
胡说八道
Bullshit.

947
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,730
只有监狱管理局能移送
Only the Bureau of Prisons can approve a transfer.

948
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,070
但是  我今天去见了肖恩・卡荷尔
I know, but the thing is, I went to see Sean Cahill today.

949
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,620
他想让你在一场审判中作证
Turns out he wants you to testify in a trial.

950
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,700
所以你可以随意
So, you can call the Bureau of Prisons

951
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,380
去找监狱管理局
all you want.

952
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,350
但等到你的律师把你带出去
By the time your lawyers get you out,

953
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,140
你早就变了一个人了
you're never gonna be the same again.

954
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,060
我明白了
I get it.

955
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,130
你希望我停止资助哈德曼
You want me to stop backing Hardman.

956
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,870
而你要继续度你的假
And you go back to working on your break

957
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,680
别再让我见到你
and I don't have to see your face again.

958
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,350
你真是生活在梦里  朋友
You're living in a dream world, pal,

959
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,470
因为那不可能
'cause that's never gonna happen.

960
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,100
那我的建议是
Well then here's my advice.

961
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,970
等你到了雷克岛监狱  直接喝漂白剂吧
When you get to Rikers, drink bleach.

962
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,750
能帮你进医务室
It'll get you sent to the infirmary.

963
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,930
那里要安全得多
It's much safer there.

964
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,460
我不用进医务室
Oh, I don't need to go to the infirmary

965
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,910
因为我有能保证我
'cause I got something that's gonna keep me

966
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,710
像在妈妈臂弯里一样安全的东西
as safe as a baby in his mother's arms.

967
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,130
钱
Money.

968
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,920
你可以试试运气  查尔斯
You take that chance, Charles,

969
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,410
可只要有一个人
but if there's one guy

970
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,140
不在乎你的臭钱
who doesn't give a shit about your money,

971
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,770
他就会收拾你  而没人会阻止他
he's gonna get you, and nobody's gonna stop him.

972
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,630
但问题是  哈维
Here's the thing, Harvey.

973
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,290
没人不在乎钱
Nobody doesn't give a shit about money.

974
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,010
而且  不到一周  我就会回到这里
Besides, in a week, I'll be right back here

975
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,360
一个接一个抢走你们的客户
picking off your clients one by one.

976
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,900
你想阻止我  就辞职
You want to stop me, step down.

977
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,120
-你说什么  -你辞职
- What? - You resign,

978
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,910
他的钱就没了
His money goes away.

979
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,090
我就知道
I knew it.

980
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,090
你关心那里的人
You care about the people there,

981
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,740
就像你当年关心你的小弟弟一样
just like you cared about your little brother way back when.

982
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,580
不可能
No way.

983
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,250
我不同意
No deal.

984
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,450
在你给我答复之前我要说
Now, before you give me an answer--

985
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,390
你今晚来这里  是因为你知道
you came here tonight because you know

986
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,810
你无论如何都会输
you're gonna lose anyway.

987
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,120
那为什么不在自己还可以的时候
So why not save whatever poor sap it is

988
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,430
救下最后一点点力量呢
while you still can?

989
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,370
我为什么要相信你真的会
Why should I believe you would even live up

990
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,820
实现你的承诺呢
to your end of the bargain?

991
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,670
因为我根本不在乎
Because I don't give a shit about your war

992
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,200
你跟丹尼尔・哈德曼的斗争
with Daniel Hardman.

993
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,190
我也非常确定我更不在乎
And I sure as hell don't give a shit

994
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,530
你的律所
about your firm.

995
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,980
我想要的只是看着你跪下
All I want to do is see you get down

996
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,020
然后说  "我退出"
on your knees and say, "I quit."

997
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,700
特雷弗
Trevor.

998
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,770
迈克
Hey, Mike.

999
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,570
-谢谢你能来  -没什么
- Thanks for coming. - Yeah, hey,

1000
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,730
-我很高兴你打给我  -我也是
- I'm glad you called. - Yeah, me too.

1001
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,650
说起来  上次见面
Listen, uh, about the last time,

1002
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,950
我说了些
I said some things--

1003
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,730
我们都说了过分的话
Ah, we both said some things.

1004
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,970
而我做得过分了  我很抱歉
But I did some things. And I'm sorry.

1005
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,380
我有个机会让你补偿我
Well, uh, I have a way you can make it up to me.

1006
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,310
来我的婚礼吧
Come to my wedding.

1007
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,670
你希望我出席  对我意义重大
It means a lot to me that you want me there,

1008
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,620
但是对不起
but I'm sorry.

1009
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,190
我不能去
I can't.

1010
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,870
不能去是什么意思
What do you mean you can't?

1011
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,050
我已经结婚了
Look, I'm married now,

1012
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,340
我跟我妻子承诺说过去那部分生活
and I promised my wife that that part of my life

1013
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,180
已经完全过去了
is behind me.

1014
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,340
那跟你来我的婚礼有什么关系呢
What does that have to do with you coming to my wedding?

1015
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,310
她都不同意我来这儿见你
She didn't even want me to meet you here.

1016
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,600
你不明白吗
Don't you get it?

1017
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,010
你在违法
You're breaking the law

1018
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,720
每天都在
every day.

1019
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,760
-你在指责我  -不
- You're judging me? - No.

1020
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,140
我不是指责你
I'm not judging you.

1021
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,450
没什么能比让我举杯庆祝你的新生活
Nothing would make me happier than to raise a glass

1022
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,630
更能让我开心的
to your new life,

1023
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,650
但我不能
But I can't.

1024
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,020
你也不应该
And you shouldn't either.

1025
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,350
所以我不该结婚了
Oh, so now I shouldn't get married?

1026
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,050
不  我是说你应该辞职
No, I'm saying you should quit.

1027
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,580
好吧
Oh, okay.

1028
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,750
谢谢你的建议  特雷弗
Well, thank you for the advice, Trevor.

1029
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,320
但我不觉得我会那么做
But I don't think I'm going to do that.

1030
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,920
迈克  人生走得越远
Michael, the longer you go,

1031
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,660
钱就越不重要
the less the money matters.

1032
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,720
食物不再美味
The food doesn't taste as good.

1033
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,630
车不再够快
The car isn't fast enough.

1034
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,300
视野不再够高
The view isn't high enough.

1035
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,260
最终你会发现
And finally you realize

1036
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,780
你愿意付出一切
that you would trade it all in

1037
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,510
换取一夜  能好好躺下来
for one night of going to bed

1038
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,070
完全不用担心
where you don't have to worry,

1039
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,620
"他们什么时候会来抓我"
"When are they gonna come for me?"

1040
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,180
你差点被抓  是吗
You almost got caught, didn't you?

1041
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,180
没有  我只是受不了了
No, I didn't. I just couldn't take it any more.

1042
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,660
最终我去找了个人聊了聊
So finally I went to talk to someone.

1043
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,550
是谁
Who?

1044
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,150
你知道是谁
You know who.

1045
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,570
我得走了
I gotta go.

1046
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,810
保重  迈克
Take care, Micheal.
