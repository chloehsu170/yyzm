{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

17
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,390
我建议我们两个
I'm talking about the both of us,

18
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,940
建议哈德曼两个厉害的初级合伙人
convincing Hardman that two kickass junior partners

19
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,660
比一个新高级合伙人要好
are worth as much as one new senior partner.

20
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,870
只要你愿意做小人
You had the chance to triple our business,

21
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,690
就能把我们的生意扩大两倍
and all you had to do was take a knee.

22
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,080
现在就告诉我  不是你
Tell me right now you weren't the one

23
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,730
把我的计划透露给了弗莱彻引擎公司
that Fletcher Engines my game plan.

24
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,610
哈德曼跟我说  他本来就没想让你做合伙人
Hardman told me he wasn't gonna make you partner anyway.

25
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,390
他把这个机会给我
And once he offered it to me,

26
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,400
-我只要  -出卖我
-all I had to do was... - Sell me out.

27
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,350
迈克的无偿服务案是针对一个监狱
Mike's pro bono is against some prison.

28
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,570
你猜是谁建的这些监狱
And guess who builds those prisons.

29
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,690
我向他保证过
I gave him my word.

30
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,050
你也曾经向我保证过
And you once gave your word to me

31
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,930
然后出尔反尔
and went back on it.

32
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,430
我不得不当面对他撒谎
I had to lie to Harvey's face.

33
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,400
你要么去法律诊所工作
You either go and work at the clinic

34
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,120
要么继续留在皮尔逊・斯佩克特
or you stay at Pearson Specter.

35
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,410
但你不能再像现在这样把两边都当傻瓜
But you can't play them both for fools

36
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,930
还让我来当你的挡箭牌
and put me in the middle.

37
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,930
我和他的诊所签了协议
I have a binding agreement signed by his legal clinic,

38
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,190
声称他们不会接受
stating that they would have no outside help

39
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,980
皮尔森-斯派克特-利特的帮助
from Pearson Specter Litt on this case.

40
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,730
但他们用了
Yet they did.

41
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,620
你说愈合心伤的唯一办法
You convinced me the only way to heal

42
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,460
就是避免让这种事发生在其他人身上
was to keep this from happening to someone else,

43
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,620
现在我一无所有了
and now I have nothing.

44
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,270
你这样做并非只是为了
This isn't just about you protecting

45
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,440
维护你委托人的利益
your client's interests.

46
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,950
而且是为了保护你自己
It's about you protecting yourself.

47
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,500
所以你还是把实话告诉我吧
Why don't you tell me what's really going on here?

48
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,660
就是这样
That's it.

49
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,170
他们此后一直以此要挟我
They've had me by the balls ever since.

50
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,290
天呐  你怎么会让自己陷入那样的境地
Jesus-- how'd you let yourself get compromised like that?

51
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,770
这是我的事  哈维
This is my situation, Harvey.

52
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,020
不  这是律所的事
No. This is a firm situation,

53
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,760
而且我们得跟那些混蛋撇清关系
and we need to cut ties with those bastards

54
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,580
马上就做
right the hell now.

55
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,520
难以置信
I don't believe this.

56
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,300
我向你坦白  你却拿官位压我
You're pulling rank after I opened up to you?

57
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,990
太扯了
That's bullshit.

58
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,050
不  亚历克斯
No, Alex.

59
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,130
扯淡的是你居然允许自己
What's bullshit is you letting yourself

60
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,490
五年来都处于这样的情况之中
be put in that position for the last five years.

61
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,070
-允许  -是的  允许
- Letting? - Yeah, letting.

62
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,750
现在我得帮我们解脱  因为你坑了我
And now I gotta get us out, because you did this to me.

63
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,650
既然我们要互相指责  哈维
Well, as long as we're throwing blame around, Harvey,

64
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,230
我才没坑你
I didn't do shit to you.

65
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,730
是你坑了我
You did this to me.

66
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,780
全押
All in.

67
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,610
这次别想  哥们
Not this time, brother.

68
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,990
我发现你了
I got you.

69
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,260
你发现个鬼
Bullshit, you got me.

70
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,660
{\an8}七年前

71
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,890
我了解你的手法
I know how you play.

72
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,250
你看过才开牌  你至多就有个J加10
You checked to open. You got jack/ten at best.

73
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,650
你在唬人  我跟
This is a bluff. I'm calling.

74
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,000
随你的吧
Do what you have to do.

75
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,440
两个K一个7  混蛋
Kings over sevens, motherfu--er.

76
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,710
3个7  小家伙
Trip sevens, little man.

77
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,360
或许你终究不了解我的手法
Maybe you don't know how I play after all.

78
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,430
你情绪不对劲
You're on tilt.

79
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,580
一晚上都是
You've been on tilt all night.

80
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,400
刚刚那一手很蠢  你也清楚
That was a stupid play and you know it.

81
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,580
你怎么回事
What's going on with you?

82
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,920
我今天本该当上合伙人的
I was supposed to make partner today,

83
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,910
但路易・利特坑了我  就是这样
but Louis Litt screwed me over, so there.

84
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,260
所以我火大
That's why I'm pissed.

85
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,120
我去
Shit.

86
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,640
我不知道
I didn't know.

87
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,890
现在你知道了
Well, now you do.

88
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,630
我不明白  哈维
I don't understand, Harvey.

89
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,180
我以为你在那边是杰西卡・皮尔逊的人
I thought you were Jessica Pearson's guy over there.

90
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,490
我也以为  但她没有支持我
I thought so too, but she didn't have my back.

91
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,600
那要是我支持你呢
Well, what if I had your back?

92
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,660
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

93
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,060
我听汤米・布莱顿的意思
I heard Tommy Bratton talking.

94
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,350
他们打算招人进来
They're looking to bring someone in.

95
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,900
只要你开口  我肯定能让你做为合伙人进来
You say the word, I bet I can get you in as partner.

96
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,850
你有什么好处
What's in it for you?

97
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,750
布莱顿打算去邀请一个
Bratton's about to make an offer

98
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,670
斯卡登的挣钱好手
to some big-time earner at Skadden.

99
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,550
要我说  我们去
I say you and me go in there

100
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,060
跟他说  两个初级合伙人比一个
and tell him two junior partners are a hell of a lot better

101
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,200
高级合伙人要好
than one senior partner.

102
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,550
-算了  -得了  哈维
- Pass. - Come on, Harvey.

103
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,670
想想嘛
At least think about it.

104
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,810
我不需要想
I don't need to think about it.

105
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,490
我刚经历了这样的事
I just went through the same thing,

106
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,000
而提出提议的那人
and the guy who proposed it

107
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,500
最终背后给了我一刀
ended up stabbing me in the back.

108
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,540
我不会那么对你的
I wouldn't do that to you.

109
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,140
是啊  多谢你的提议  但是
Yeah, well, I appreciate your offer, but...

110
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,190
我不会给你机会的
I'm not going to give you the opportunity.

111
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,520
要我借你筹码吗
Now, you need me to stake you?

112
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,320
给你300
There's 300.

113
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
我听说法庭上的事了
I heard about what happened in court.

114
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,110
我知道你放弃了案子  迈克  我很遗憾
I know you gave up the case, Mike, I'm sorry.

115
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,860
瑞秋  我放弃了案子是因为你提醒我
Rachel, I gave the case up because you reminded me

116
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,030
要遵守承诺  但我说过了
to be a man of my word, but like I said,

117
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,220
我先承诺了奥斯卡・雷耶斯
I gave my word to Oscar Reyes first.

118
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,670
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

119
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,240
意思是我不想骗你
It means that I don't want to lie to you,

120
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,290
我也不想骗哈维  但是
and I don't want to lie to Harvey, but...

121
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,240
我会让这案子上刑事法庭
I'm going to get this case opened in criminal court,

122
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,960
而且这并不违反
and for the record, that does not violate

123
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,180
我签署的协议
the agreement that I signed.

124
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,510
那你会告诉哈维咯
So you're going to tell Harvey, right?

125
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,830
如果他问  我会说
If he asks me, I'll tell him,

126
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,770
但我不会主动说
but I'm not going to volunteer it,

127
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,460
而且我要知道你是否能接受
and I need to know if you're good with that.

128
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,620
-迈克  -你回答前
- Mike-- - Before you answer,

129
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,110
我要你想想
I want you to think about the fact

130
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,750
这些人在延长刑期
that these guys are extending sentences.

131
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,430
如果是我在里面
What if it were me in there, 

132
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,580
是我的刑期被延长了呢
and it was my sentence that got extended?

133
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,360
我只有一个问题
I just have one question.

134
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
要是哈维问我呢
What if Harvey asks me about it?

135
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,640
那你说实话
Then you tell him the truth.

136
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,490
那好  我能接受
Then yeah, I'm good with it.

137
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,210
*看到钱  就愿意留下吃饭*
*See the money, wanna stay for your meal*

138
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,620
*给你太太再拿块馅饼*
*Get another piece of pie for your wife*

139
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,990
*所有人都想知道那感觉*
*Everybody wanna know how it feel*

140
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,230
*所有人都想见见那景象*
*Everybody wanna see what it's like*

141
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,510
*豆子馅饼我也愿吃  我不在乎*
*I'll even eat a bean pie, I don't mind*

142
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,440
*我和妹子忙着赚钱*
*Me and Missy is so busy, busy making money*

143
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,630
*好了*
*All right*

144
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,660
*退开点  我要跳舞*
*All step back, I'm 'bout to dance*

145
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,500
*美钞爵士摇摇摇*
*The greenback boogie*

{\an8}诉讼双雄 第七季 第七集

147
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,170
这是什么
What's this?

148
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,200
我还没为让我当上律师的事感谢你
I never thanked you for allowing me into the Bar,

149
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,730
我觉得比起果篮  你会更喜欢刑事案件
and I figured you'd prefer a criminal case to a fruit basket.

150
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,940
这是民事诉讼
This is a civil case.

151
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,990
原本是的
It was a civil case.

152
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,300
但不非得
But it doesn't have to be.

153
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,140
听上去不像礼物
That doesn't sound like a gift to me.

154
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,390
像是帮你忙
It sounds like a favor for you.

155
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,290
安妮塔  你说你看重做正确的事
Anita, you said you're about doing what's right.

156
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,590
有人为牟利而有意延长刑期
People are being kept in prison for money.

157
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,020
这是不对的
That's not right.

158
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,970
即便真是如此
If that's true.

159
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,980
我很希望我能做点什么  但我做不了
I wish there was something I could do about it, but I can't.

160
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,000
什么意思
What do you mean, you can't?

161
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,010
你明白的
You know what I mean.

162
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,160
没有人会希望我花时间
Nobody wants to see me spending my time

163
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,100
帮助坏人出狱
getting bad guys out of prison.

164
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,200
那如果我告诉你这是两家财富500强
And what if I told you it was a criminal conspiracy

165
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,430
公司之间的犯罪阴谋呢
between two Fortune 500 companies?

166
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,460
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

167
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,700
我无法追查这件案子是因为
I couldn't pursue the case because we represent

168
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,920
另一位委托人向我们施压  要我们放弃
another client who was pressuring me to drop it,

169
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,390
他们那么做
and there's no way they did that

170
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,970
绝不会单纯为保护改造公司  他们也有份
just to protect Reform Corp., which means they're in on it.

171
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,070
你有证据吗
Do you have any proof?

172
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,190
没有  但是
No, but--

173
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,190
你给我拿来阴谋的证据  我就追查
You bring me some proof of a conspiracy and I'll pursue it.

174
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,110
我只能做到这里了
That's the best I can do.

175
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,850
安妮塔  我没有资源去
Anita, I don't have the resources to--

176
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,810
不关我的事
Not my problem.

177
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,260
还有
And another thing...

178
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,620
不关你拿来什么  必须是关于改造公司的
Whatever you do bring me has to be on the Reform Corp.

179
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,420
与协议无关  否则
Side of the arrangement, because if it isn't,

180
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,700
你就打破了保密协议  我也没法用
you're breaking privilege, and I can't use any of it.

181
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,670
哈维
Harvey.

182
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,290
我有事要告诉你  但我得知道
There's something I want to tell you, but I need to know

183
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,470
你是否已经放下了路易和升职的事
if you're over what happened with Louis and the promotion.

184
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,630
我没事  唐娜
I'm fine, Donna.

185
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,370
那好  因为我明早得早点下班
Good, because I need to leave work early tomorrow night.

186
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,430
干什么
What for?

187
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,440
是我跟马克的六个月纪念
It's my six-month anniversary with Mark.

188
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,290
-这个表情干吗  -没事
- What's that face? - Nothing.

189
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,830
我大概只是没想到你也是那样的人
I guess I just didn't think you were one of those people.

190
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,600
什么样的人
What people?

191
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,440
就是会庆祝
The people that celebrate

192
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,480
侄女三年级毕业
their niece's third-grade graduation

193
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
当做像登月一般隆重的人
like it was the Moon landing.

194
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,600
你上次跟谁
And when was the last time

195
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,710
认真约会六个月是什么时候了
you saw anyone seriously for six months?

196
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,520
我不是这谈话的话题
I'm not the topic of this conversation.

197
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,540
你怎么能是呢
How could you be?

198
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,260
因为我们在说
Because we're talking about

199
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,910
成熟投入的感情关系
a mature and committed relationship.

200
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,280
你说得对  唐娜  是这样
You're right, Donna, we are,

201
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,740
所以  我有份礼物给你庆祝纪念日
which is why I got you a gift to celebrate your anniversary.

202
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,020
哈维
Harvey...

203
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,010
这很慷慨  但我不能要
this is very generous, but I can't accept it.

204
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,660
为什么不
Why not?

205
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,770
因为马克为我们计划了特别一晚
Because Mark planned a special night for us,

206
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,600
等我拿出一张礼品卡来支付时
and how's he going to feel when I pull out a gift card

207
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,710
他会怎么想啊
to help pay for it?

208
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,400
-我不是那意思  -我知道
- That wasn't the idea. - I know,

209
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,350
但如果你真想给我礼物
but if you want to really give me a gift,

210
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,330
答应我  你一晚上都不会打来  或打断我
promise you won't call or interrupt me the entire night.

211
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,540
我保证
I promise.

212
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,720
谢谢  哈维
Thanks, Harvey.

213
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,590
该死  杰弗里  这可是工作场所
God damn it, Jeffrey, this is a place of business,

214
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,810
不是宠物动物园  你要么把金鱼冲下下水道
not a petting zoo, so you either flush the goldfish

215
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,370
要么就等着被炒吧
or you're fired.

216
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,160
你没有那个权力
You don't have the authority to do that.

217
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,870
章程207节  第三段
Section 207, paragraph three of the by-laws:

218
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,660
不服合伙人命令可以解雇
Insubordination to a partner results in termination.

219
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,650
这跟我的鱼毫无关系  你也清楚
This has nothing to do with my fish and you know it.

220
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,000
当然就是为了你的鱼
It's got everything to do with that fish,

221
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,330
你别再顶嘴了
and I don't want to hear another word about it,

222
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,360
所以除非你想再...
so unless you want to say another word--

223
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,660
路易  能谈谈吗
Louis, can I talk to you for a second?

224
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,710
杰西卡  我正在...
Hey, Jessica, I was just in the middle of something--

225
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,680
马上
Now.

226
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,900
-怎么  -你在干什么
- Yes? - What the hell do you think you're doing?

227
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,370
我在对那个讨厌鬼
I'm exercising my authority

228
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,380
行使我合伙人的权力
as junior partner over that douche.

229
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,300
通过弄死他的鱼吗
By trying to kill his fish?

230
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,920
不  通过努力保持这里的秩序
No, by trying to keep order in the bullpen.

231
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,430
杰西卡  杰弗里的工作习惯
Jessica, Jeffrey's work habits are--

232
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,840
是因为我没有叫他初级合伙人
It's because I didn't call him junior partner.

233
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,060
闭嘴  这和我对他
Shut up, this has nothing to do

234
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,190
那条愚蠢无礼的鱼的看法
with how I feel about his stupid,

235
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,050
没有半点关系
disrespectful asshole fish.

236
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,670
路易...
Louis...

237
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,490
你想过看心理医生吗
have you considered therapy?

238
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,100
我干嘛要那么做
Why would I do that?

239
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,510
那就像是让巴雷什尼科夫上舞蹈课一样
That would be like Baryshnikov taking dance lessons.

240
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,510
{\an8}20世纪最出色的舞蹈家之一

241
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,240
-路易  -杰西卡
- Louis-- - Jessica,

242
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,250
软蛋才会退缩
shrinks are for pussies.

243
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,780
现在  我能回去继续教训杰弗里吗
Now, can I go back to yelling at Jeffrey?

244
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,180
这些助理需指导和教训
Because these associates need guidance and discipline.

245
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,090
听我说  路易
Listen to me, Louis.

246
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,010
你和哈维的事我之所以置身事外
I stayed out of that whole thing between you and Harvey

247
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,470
是因为这是丹尼尔的决定
because that was Daniel's call.

248
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,740
你想欺负初级律师  我不管你
And you want to go off on the associates, that's one thing,

249
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,430
但如果你拿这次升职太当回事
but you let this promotion go to your head,

250
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,040
而拿哈维出气的话
and you take it out on Harvey,

251
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,970
我就不会置身事外了
I'm going to step the hell back in.

252
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,590
杰西卡  作为初级合伙人我向你保证
Jessica, you have my word as junior partner:

253
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,800
哈维出了什么问题
if there's any problem with Harvey,

254
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,040
都不会是我惹的
it won't be because of me.

255
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,520
我现在忙着呢
I'm a little busy right now.

256
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,220
不管你忙什么  都放放再说
Well, whatever it is, put it to the side.

257
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,480
丹尼尔想让你和路易一起处理
Daniel wants you to work with Louis

258
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,010
莱因斯多夫的案子
on the Reinsdorf case.

259
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,950
你有什么话  就直说吧
You got something to say, Harvey, say it.

260
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,690
好  那我就说了
Okay, I'll say it.

261
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,130
哈德曼搞我时你并没站我这边
You didn't have my back when Hardman screwed me over,

262
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,200
现在他想羞辱我
and now you're carrying his water

263
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,820
你还帮着他
while he tries to humiliate me.

264
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,390
我不管他想干嘛
I don't care what he's doing.

265
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,560
我在乎的是我做的事  就是看你能不能
I care about what I'm doing, which is to see if you can

266
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,660
放下你的自尊  往长远了看
put that ego of yours aside and play the long game.

267
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,060
你什么意思
What the hell are you talking about?

268
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,680
我知道有多少次查尔斯・范・戴克
Do you have any idea how many times I had to smile

269
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,110
把他的工作扔给我时我得笑脸相陪
and take it when Charles Van Dyke pawned his work off on me?

270
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,010
当斯坦利・戈登把我叫到他办公室
Or when Stanley Gordon would call me into his office

271
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,920
只是为了我离开时能视奸我的屁股
just so he could ogle my ass when I left?

272
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,770
这不是一回事
That is not the same thing.

273
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,220
更别提施密特像活在20世纪50年代那样
Not to mention when Schmidt would talk about "The blacks"

274
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,610
谈论黑人
like he was living in 1950.

275
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,560
我忍辱负重这么多年  哈维
I sucked it up for years, Harvey.

276
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,500
现在轮到你了
Now it's your turn.

277
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,700
如果我忍不了呢
What if I won't?

278
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,480
那你我不是一伙人  因为如果你连
Then you're not my guy, because if you can't even

279
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,560
假装向对手服软都不会
pretend to bend a knee to your rivals,

280
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,130
那无论日后你通过做什么试图超越他们
it doesn't matter what you do to get ahead of them in the future.

281
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,880
因为他们在一英里外就会发现你
They're going to see you coming a mile away.

282
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,840
克鲁格先生  多谢你能见我
Mr. Kreuger, I appreciate you meeting me.

283
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,140
这里又不是唐顿庄园  哈维
This isn't Downton Abbey, Harvey.

284
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,710
这是个建筑公司
It's a construction firm.

285
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,610
叫我派特  随意点
Call me Pat, or see yourself out.

286
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,540
那好吧  派特
Fair enough, Pat.

287
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,570
我想你知道我们律所一个初级合伙人
I'm sure you know that a junior partner at our firm

288
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,870
违背了约定
broke his word.

289
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,540
我想应该表示下歉意
I think you're owed an apology.

290
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,260
通常都是客户付钱给律师
Usually the clients pay the lawyers,

291
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,470
而不是反过来
not the other way around.

292
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,140
现在是非常情况
This is a unique situation.

293
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,050
这笔钱数目太大  看起来像贿赂了
This looks a lot like you're trying to pay me off.

294
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,090
我只是想改变错误  让你能继续自己的事
I'm trying to make things right, and allow you to move on.

295
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,080
你想知道如何得到别人鼎力支持吗  哈维
You want to know how to get someone's best effort, Harvey?

296
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,140
不是给他们一大笔钱
It's not paying them the most money.

297
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,570
而是要保证你们之间
It's making sure that their interests

298
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,250
有共同的利益
are aligned with yours,

299
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,410
亚历克斯・威廉姆斯和我一样都想了结此案
and Alex Williams wants this case to go away as much as I do.

300
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,470
你不用把自己利益和别人绑在一起
You don't need your interests aligned anymore.

301
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,730
这案子结束了
This case is over.

302
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,130
或许是  或许不是
Maybe it is. And maybe it isn't.

303
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,250
但我听说过你们律所有类似的事
But I've heard that from your firm once before.

304
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,080
我记得是你自己的律师
And then I believe it was your own associate

305
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,290
先对案子提起重审的
who opened the case again in the first place.

306
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,650
所以  你看  哈维
So, you see, Harvey,

307
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,780
此事利益不仅牵涉到
it's not just Alex's interests

308
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,180
亚历克斯和我  还包括你的
that are aligned with mine. It's yours.

309
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,880
我觉得这样挺好的
And I plan to keep it that way.

310
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,120
我猜猜  你是来核查我的证词的
Let me guess: you're here to go over my testimony.

311
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,900
我告诉过你除非我女儿拿到了钱
I already told you I'm not giving you anything

312
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,100
否则我什么也不会说
until my daughter gets paid.

313
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,500
我不是为这个来的  弗兰克
It's not what I'm here for, Frank.

314
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,270
我得知道你知不知道
I need to know if you know

315
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,950
改造公司跟外面有什么阴谋
anything about a conspiracy outside of Reform Corp.

316
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,740
改造公司外面...
Conspiracy outside of R--

317
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,510
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

318
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,120
这是怎么回事
What the hell's going on here?

319
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,580
我们的案子被驳回了
We got thrown off the case.

320
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,620
你刚才说什么
What did you just say to me?

321
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,190
-弗兰克  -你之前来
- Frank-- - 'Cause you came in here

322
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,720
承诺要给我女儿个未来
promising my daughter a future.

323
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,590
现在你告诉我这都是废话
Now you're telling me it's all a bunch of shit.

324
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,590
这不是废话
It's not a bunch of shit,

325
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,820
我能让案子重审
and I can get the case reopened,

326
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,390
但我得掌握马斯特森建筑公司
but I need evidence of a conspiracy

327
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,610
阴谋的相关证据
with Masterson Construction.

328
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,380
那我帮不了你  因为据我所知
Then I can't help you, 'cause all I know is,

329
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,530
就是这些人给我们安排的工作
those are the guys that put us all to work.

330
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,370
工作
Work?

331
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,700
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

332
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,230
这些地方可不像丹伯里
Those places aren't like Danbury.

333
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,560
我们拼命的给他们建造监狱
We work our asses off to build their prison

334
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,490
能让他们多关些像我们这种人
so they can put more of us away.

335
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,470
但如果你想找什么阴谋  那没有
But if you're looking for a conspiracy, there's not.

336
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,630
这件事是公开的  名曰"能力重建"
They do it all out in the open, call it "Rehabilitation."

337
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,950
这件事或许没猫腻  但别的肯定有
Well, it may not have been hidden, but something is.

338
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,740
我觉得你帮我指明了正确方向
And I think you just pointed me in the right direction.

339
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,750
你都干了什么
What the hell did you do?

340
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,410
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

341
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,180
你背着我去找马斯特森
You went to Masterson behind my back.

342
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,960
我之前告诉你我得怎么做
I did what I told you I was going to do.

343
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,440
我把你弄进的烂摊子  我要把你弄出来
I got you into this mess, I'm going to get you out.

344
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,910
去找马斯特森
Then all going to Masterson does

345
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,140
就是让自己成为他们的目标
is put you in their crosshairs.

346
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,620
我早就是他们的目标了
I'm already in their crosshairs.

347
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,870
既然我知道什么情况
And now that I know what happened,

348
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,670
我也就是其中一份子了
I might as well have been a part of it myself.

349
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,990
我们该把真相告诉迈克・罗斯
Then maybe instead of poking the bear,

350
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,740
而不是去招惹一头熊
we should tell Mike Ross the truth.

351
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,100
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

352
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,070
我们都清楚除非案子结束
We both know that Mike is not going to let this thing go

353
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,440
否则迈克不会置之不顾的
till he gets to the bottom of it.

354
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,770
也许  如果我坦白一切
Maybe, if I just come clean--

355
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,690
听我说  亚历克斯
Listen to me, Alex.

356
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,820
你去把你的事告诉他
You go to him with your story,

357
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,340
你就是在帮他把事情理清楚
you're going to give him a map to what happened,

358
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,410
那是一罐汽油  加一根火柴
a can of gas, and a match

359
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,330
让他去把一切都点了
to light the whole damn thing on fire.

360
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,300
希望你是对的  哈维  因为我还有个女儿
I hope you're right, Harvey, because I've got a daughter,

361
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,560
如果我不趁有机会就把事情摆平
and if I didn't take a chance to stop this thing when I had it...

362
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,280
听我说  亚历克斯  你别管了
I'm telling you, Alex, you let it go.

363
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,070
-哈维  -路易
- Harvey. - Louis.

364
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,780
杰西卡说哈德曼想让我们
Jessica said Hardman wants us to work

365
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,460
一起处理莱因斯多夫的案子
on the Reinsdorf case together.

366
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,540
她跟我也这么说
She said the same thing to me.

367
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,430
我是来帮忙的  不是来吵架的
Well, I'm here to help, not get in a fight.

368
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,730
我也这么想
My feelings exactly.

369
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,650
很好  我觉得我们可以先讨论下战术
Good, I thought we could start by talking strategy.

370
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,800
等等  你是首席吗
I'm sorry, but are you first chair?

371
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,020
不  你是  但是我觉得
No, you are, but I just thought--

372
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,260
你想法并不重要
Doesn't matter what you thought,

373
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,160
因为我们的战术就是向他们的法务长下手
because our strategy is to go after their general counsel.

374
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,440
你打算何时罢免这家伙
And when would you like to depose this guy?

375
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,390
不  我要让这混蛋上法庭
Never, because I'm going to put that asshole on the stand,

376
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,000
然后把他像逾越节的面包一样撕碎
and I'm going to crack him like a piece of matzo on Passover.

377
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,620
路易  你不罢免他而让他直接上庭
Louis, you put him on the stand without deposing him,

378
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,800
你得问些你连答案都不知道的问题
you'll be asking questions you don't know the answers to.

379
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,580
-那又怎么了  -那
- So what? - So,

380
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,480
这是律师从业的第一守则
that's the number one rule of lawyering.

381
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,760
多谢提醒  F.李・贝雷
Well, thank you, F. Lee Bailey.

382
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,760
{\an8}O.J.辛普森的律师

383
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,970
我觉得这的第一守则
And here I thought the number one rule

384
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,560
是知道你自己的位置
was to know your goddamn place.

385
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,910
我不需要一个六年律师给的建议
And I don't need to take advice from a sixth-year associate.

386
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,660
我不想因为你不听劝
And I don't need to take a loss on my record

387
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,660
害我全胜记录被打破
because you're too insecure to listen to reason.

388
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,220
你知道吗  哈维  你什么也不用做
You know what, Harvey, you don't need to take anything

389
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,010
因为本案不归你管
because you're not in charge.

390
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,240
所以你决定吧  你是上庭
So it's up to you: you gonna get on board

391
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,620
还是回家找妈妈抱抱
or are you gonna go crying to mama?

392
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,790
你说得对  路易  你是合伙人
You're right, Louis. You're the partner.

393
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,120
你是来支持你的
I'm just here to back you up.

394
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,730
唐娜  我想让你放下手头的工作
Donna, I want you to pull whatever strings you have to

395
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,710
把莱因斯多夫的案子提到明天
to get the Reinsdorf trial moved up to tomorrow.

396
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,810
我这就去
I'll get right on it.

397
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,470
还有  别告诉路易
And one more thing: don't tell Louis.

398
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,520
什么  哈维
What? Harvey,

399
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,490
杰西卡说言归于好
Jessica said to bury the hatchet,

400
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,820
不是背后给路易捅刀子
not stick it in Louis's back.

401
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,690
唐娜  我带着一片好意去他办公室
Donna, I went into his office in good faith

402
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,960
他用了不到30秒
and it took him less than 30 seconds

403
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,350
就拿头衔来压我
to wave his title in my face.

404
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,490
这和你把你的自尊至于公司利益之上
What does that have to do with putting

405
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,090
有什么关系
the firm's interest above your ego?

406
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,840
因为  当我对他的战术提出合理问题时
Because, when I brought up a legitimate issue with his strategy, 

407
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,720
他不分青红皂白
he shot me down for no other reason

408
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,010
立刻就让我闭嘴
than it came out of my mouth.

409
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,640
我告诉你  我们不这么做  就得输了
I'm telling you: we don't do this, we're going to lose.

410
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,860
看着我
Look at me.

411
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,580
你确定这样做是正确的吗
Are you sure this is the right call?

412
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,010
听我说
Listen to me.

413
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,220
杰西卡让我把目光放长远  我正是这么做的
Jessica wants me to play the long game, and that's what I'm doing.

414
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,910
我坐在那儿装怂  他当真了
I sat in there, ate shit, and he bought it.

415
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,340
所以  明天我要赢下这个案子
So now, tomorrow, I'm going to win this thing,

416
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,750
杰西卡就知道她可以指望我了
and Jessica's going to know she can count on me.

417
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,600
好吧
All right.

418
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,760
我来提前庭审日期
I'll move the court date,

419
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,180
并且确保路易不会知道这件事
and I'll make sure Louis doesn't find out.

420
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,140
很好  哈维  你过来了
Harvey, good, you're here.

421
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,750
我们没机会谈谈你  亚历克斯  还有迈克之间
We didn't get a chance to talk about what happened

422
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,230
发生了什么
with you, Alex, and Mike.

423
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,790
确实如此  实际上
No, we didn't, and as a matter of fact,

424
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,440
我在想迈克在哪儿
I'm wondering where Mike is.

425
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,000
他之前在这儿  然后走了
Well, he was in earlier, but then he left.

426
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,780
但我猜你并不是真的
But I'm guessing that's not really

427
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,140
要问这个
the question you're asking.

428
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,910
你想知道他是不是还在管那个案子
You want to know if he's somehow still pursing that case.

429
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,060
如果确实是这样呢
And what if I do?

430
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,650
从我的个人经验来看
I would say from personal experience,

431
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,860
先做好心理准备  能接受答案再提问题
don't ask a question unless you're really ready to hear the answer.

432
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,950
你到底以为自己在干什么
What the hell do you think you're doing?

433
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,930
杰西卡  你怎么会知道
Jessica, how did you know?

434
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,110
这不是重点
It doesn't matter how.

435
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,220
重点在于  我让你和路易一起负责这个案子
What matters is, I told you to work it out with Louis,

436
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,850
而路易现在坐在办公室里
and right now, he's sitting in his office

437
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,680
根本不知道案子开庭了
with no idea this case is starting.

438
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,200
就像你说的  我在打持久战
Exactly, I'm playing the long game, like you said.

439
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,110
不  哈维
No, Harvey.

440
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,380
你什么都别想打了
You're not playing anything,

441
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,740
因为这个案子是我的了
because this case is mine now.

442
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,820
-什么  -你已经听见了
- What? - You heard me.

443
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,110
我给你下达了直接命令
I gave you a direct order,

444
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,750
而你根本没拿我当回事
and you spat in my face.

445
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,150
这太扯了  杰西卡
Jessica, this is bullshit.

446
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,670
我去跟路易谈话  可他直接羞辱我
I went in there and he spat in my face,

447
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,000
这点我可以忍  但我忍不了的是
and I was willing to take it, but what I'm not willing to take

448
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,800
因为内部泄愤而输掉案子
is losing this thing out of spite,

449
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,500
要是你现在接受这个案子
and if you take this case right now,

450
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,080
你肯定会输的
you're going to lose, 

451
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,750
因为你根本不知道现在是怎么回事
because you have no idea what's going on with it.

452
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,120
我可能输也可能赢
Maybe I will and maybe I won't.

453
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,750
但有时候也得让老将坐回替补席
But sometimes you have to bench your quarterback

454
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,300
好显示谁才是团队的管理者
to show 'em who's running the team,

455
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,800
不管这样做会不会有损失
whether you take a loss or not.

456
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,110
全体起立
All rise!

457
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,220
时间到了  哈维  你该退后了
Time's up, Harvey. Step aside.

458
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,390
杰西卡  别在公众场合对我这样
Jessica, please don't do this to me in public.

459
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,070
这不是我对你怎么样
I'm not doing anything to you.

460
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,770
是你自找的
You did this to yourself.

461
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,450
律师  有问题吗
Do we have a problem, counselor?

462
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,860
没有  法官大人
No, Your Honor, we don't.

463
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,550
事务所需要我的这位同事回去处理些事情
My colleague is needed back at our firm.

464
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,720
由我来负责
I'm stepping in.

465
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,340
既然如此  全体请坐
In that case, be seated, everyone.

466
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,570
现在开庭
Court is now in session.

467
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,570
迈克尔  你为什么关门
Michael, why are you closing the door?

468
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,490
你知道门一关我就不舒服
You know I'm uncomfortable with obstructed exits.

469
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,690
因为我要让你做件事
Because I need to ask you something,

470
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,230
中途不希望被打扰
and I don't want to be interrupted.

471
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,520
迈克尔  你这是要我黑进政府机构
Michael, you're asking me to hack a government institution.

472
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,450
我不能这么干
I can't do that.

473
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,940
看仔细点  本杰明
Look closely, Benjamin.

474
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,810
这是一家私人机构  而且要我说
It's a private corporation, and I'm telling you,

475
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,220
他们是一群混蛋
they're scumbags.

476
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,630
哪个案子需要这样做
What's it for?

477
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,540
什么意思
What do you mean?

478
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,650
如果你要我做这种事
I mean, if you're asking me to do something like this,

479
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,250
我得把它归到某个案子里面
I have to bill it to a case.

480
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,830
要是我叫你不要归到案子里呢
And what if I asked you not to?

481
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,330
那我要问你为什么
I would have to ask you why.

482
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,090
我我要违抗哈维的意愿
I'm going against Harvey's wishes.

483
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,320
以前你也要我这样做过
You asked me to do that once before

484
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,550
是为了一个模拟审判
for a mock trial.

485
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,480
我要知道  这次是模拟审判  还是真格的
And I need to know, is this mock, or is it real?

486
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,510
这次是真的
It's real,

487
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,110
而且不能让哈维知道
and Harvey can't know.

488
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,390
哈维  我以为你不会到坚尼街南边来[社区相对贫穷]
Harvey, I didn't think you ever got south of Canal Street.

489
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,620
今天算是破例了
Yeah, well, today I'm making an exception.

490
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,760
你的邀约还有效吗
Is that offer still on the table?

491
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,910
你是认真的吗
Are you serious?

492
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,120
我都过来了  对吧
I'm here, aren't I?

493
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,970
那当然了  还有效
Then hell yeah, it's still on the table.

494
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,000
我这就去找汤米・布莱顿谈话
I'll talk to Tommy Bratton right now.

495
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,560
你跟他谈话的时候
Well, when you talk to him,

496
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,400
顺便告诉他  他答应我的条件  我才会来
you tell him I'm only coming over if he meets my demands.

497
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,680
什么条件
And what demands would those be?

498
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,970
我不仅要当合伙人  我要一间风景优美的办公室
I don't just want partner. I want an office with a view.

499
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,900
我赢的案子  钱都归我
I want to eat what I kill and I want to get paid

500
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,080
而且我要比事务所的其他初级合伙人挣得多
more than any other junior partner in the firm.

501
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,970
你这要求可不低
Those are some pretty big asks.

502
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,850
我不能保证布莱顿会答应
I can't guarantee Bratton's going to say yes.

503
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,770
要是你想让我帮你当合伙人  就设法让他答应吧
You want to make partner on my coattails, you make him say yes.

504
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,680
让你帮我  我们现在说的是互相帮助
Your coattails? I'm talking about me helping you 

505
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,780
我也没少帮你
as much as about you helping me.

506
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,150
那你就做好约定过的事
Then do what you said you were going to do,

507
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,630
因为如果不这样
because if you can't make that happen,

508
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,890
他们就不会尊重我  而我不想去一个
they don't respect me, and I'm not coming to a place

509
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,070
不受尊重的地方
where I'm not respected.

510
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,100
好吧  哈维  但如果你想被人尊重
Okay, Harvey, but if you want respect,

511
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,650
你也要尊重别人
you need to show some damn respect.

512
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,280
我去为你做担保
I go in to stick my neck out for you,

513
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,030
你可别说你还要考虑考虑
you don't come back and say you'll consider it.

514
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,580
成交
It's a done goddamn deal.

515
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,670
好  亚历克斯  我向你保证
Okay, Alex, you have my word.

516
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,600
你让他满足我的条件
You get me everything I'm asking for...

517
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,150
我就跟皮尔逊-哈德曼一刀两断
I'm done with Pearson Hardman.

518
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,530
杰西卡  你好
Jessica. Hey, how are ya?

519
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,680
路易  还记得我们谈过
Louis, remember when we talked about

520
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,600
不要对哈维滥用权力吧
not abusing your power with Harvey?

521
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,780
当然  所以我对他格外尊重
Absolutely, and that's why I treated him with the utmost respect.

522
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,750
如果是这样
Well, if that's the case, 

523
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,540
他为什么要瞒着你为莱因斯多夫出庭
then exactly why did he litigate Reinsdorf behind your back?

524
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,530
妈的  他干什么了
Goddamn it. What the hell did he do?

525
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,000
我不关心他做了什么
I'm not concerned with what he did.

526
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,210
我关心的是你做了什么
I'm concerned with what you did.

527
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,850
杰西卡  我发誓自己完完全全是个绅士
Jessica, I swear, I was the perfect gentleman,

528
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,010
但是哈维质疑我的领导能力
but then Harvey questioned my leadership.

529
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,570
换句话说  他有更好的想法吗
In other words, he had a better idea than you?

530
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,180
不管他的想法是不是更好
Well, whether it was or it wasn't,

531
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,180
他不尊重初级合伙人这一位置
he didn't respect the office of junior partner.

532
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,540
本来就没有"初级合伙人这一位置"  路易
Because there is no office of junior partner, Louis,

533
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,310
问题的关键不是哈维
and the real problem here isn't Harvey.

534
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,180
而是你的态度总是气势汹汹
It's that chip on your shoulder.

535
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,190
什么汹汹
What chip?

536
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,190
路易  我要你明早九点
Louis, I need you to be at this address

537
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,650
按照地址去这里
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.M.

538
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,550
-为什么  -因为我相信心理咨询会让你好些
- Why? - Because I believe you will benefit from therapy,

539
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,380
而这个人是最好的心理医生
and this man is the best in the business.

540
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,500
等等
Back the truck up.

541
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,690
杰西卡  你说心理治疗吗
Jessica, therapy?

542
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,060
我是你见过的心态最稳定的人了
I'm the most stable, secure man you ever met.

543
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,770
你要是和我争这一点
And you fight me on this,

544
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,740
你就要失去这份工作了
you'll be the most unemployed man I've ever met.

545
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,070
听明白了吗
Do we understand each other?

546
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,990
好  早上九点
Yeah. 9:00 a.M. It is.

547
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,310
还有  路易
And Louis,

548
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,510
你踏进门的那一刻
when you walk through that door,

549
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,630
就会有种强烈的想要扭头就走的冲动
you're going to be tempted to turn right the hell around,

550
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,210
让我告诉你  你要是还想在这儿干下去
and I'm telling you, if you want a future here,

551
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,910
就别那么干
you won't.

552
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,010
哈维  你怎么在这儿
Harvey, what are you doing here?

553
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,440
我以为你一整天都会在法庭上
I thought you were in court all day.

554
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,810
杰西卡有其他打算
Well, Jessica had other plans,

555
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,540
比如说把我从这个案子撵走
like booting me off this case.

556
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,460
什么
What?

557
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,340
她走进来把我撵走了
She walked in there and threw me out

558
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,920
让我夹着尾巴做人
with my tail between my legs,

559
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,300
好像我是个一文不值的一年律师
like I was a piece-of-shit first-year associate.

560
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,580
听我说  你要冷静一下  我们才能想想
Listen to me, you need to calm down so we can figure out

561
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,390
现在要怎么办
what we're going to do.

562
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,460
我很冷静
I am calm,

563
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,660
而且我已经留好后路了
and I already took care of what we're going to do.

564
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,190
什么意思
What are you talking about?

565
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,750
我在布莱顿・古尔德给我们找了份工作
I got us an offer at Bratton Gould.

566
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,340
如果事情发展如我所料
If everything goes like I think,

567
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,680
我们这周结束之前就能过去了
we'll be there by the end of the week.

568
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,480
什么
What?

569
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,910
这说不通
Harvey, that doesn't make any sense.

570
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,170
杰西卡最喜欢你了
Jessica's your biggest fan.

571
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,470
她一直都是支持你的
She's always been in your corner.

572
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,470
哈德曼提拔路易的时候  怎么没见她支持我
Was she in my corner when Hardman promoted Louis?

573
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,830
这么说不公平  那是由他决定的
That's not fair. That was his call.

574
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,310
今天在法庭所有人面前把我撵走
Well, whose call was cutting my balls off

575
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,890
又是由谁决定的
in front of the entire courtroom today?

576
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,210
我不管她说了什么
I don't care what she did.

577
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,800
那个女人自掏腰包
The woman paid for you to go to law school

578
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,810
供你念了法学院
out of her own pocket.

579
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,110
你做这种事之前
The least you can do is talk to her

580
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,480
起码你要跟她谈谈
before you do something like this.

581
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,140
唐娜  我试过和她谈
Donna, I tried talking to her.

582
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,940
但这不重要  已经太迟了
But it doesn't matter. It's too late.

583
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,170
我向亚历克斯保证过  这事不能撤销
I gave Alex my word. It's a done deal.

584
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,110
对你来说或许如此
Well, it may be a done deal for you,

585
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,800
但对我来说不是这样
but it isn't a done deal for me.

586
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,630
-唐娜  -我喜欢这里  哈维
- Donna-- - I like it here, Harvey,

587
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,960
而且你不能都不通知我一声  就这样做出
and you can't just make this kind of decision about my life 

588
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,340
关乎我人生的决定
without running it by me first.

589
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,560
如果你是想用这种方法来让我留下
If this is your way of trying to get me to stay...

590
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,760
我无意逼迫你
I'm not trying to get you to do anything,

591
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,530
但我不会在还没跟你谈清楚前
but I'm not just gonna follow you out the door

592
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,640
就跟着你离开这里
without thinking this through.

593
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,470
唐娜  你想要什么  道歉吗
What do you want, Donna? You want an apology?

594
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,980
那好  对不起  我没有事先与你商量
Well, here it is: I'm sorry I didn't consult with you.

595
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,870
我不想听对不起
I don't want an apology, Harvey.

596
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,190
我想能事先和你谈谈以便把事情捋清楚
I wanted to talk this thing through with you,

597
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,530
而且这也正是你应该事先和杰西卡做的事
which, by the way, is what you should have done with Jessica.

598
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,320
我告诉你  唐娜
Well, you know what, Donna?

599
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,160
我不是来向你征求意见的
I didn't come to you for advice.

600
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,500
我是来通知你收拾东西走人的
I came to tell you to start packing.

601
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,640
但如果你不想跟我离开
But if you don't want to come with me,

602
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,030
那就别跟
then don't come with me.

603
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,620
瑞秋  有时间吗
Rachel, do you have a second?

604
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,290
当然
Of course.

605
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,300
迈克是为我进监狱的
Mike went to prison for me.

606
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,370
我欠他的  我知道
I owe him, and I know it.

607
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,060
但他不是我唯一有所亏欠的人
But he's not the only guy I owe,

608
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,980
如果如果我不闻不问
and that guy's going to have a serious problem

609
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,260
假装迈克不是我了解的那种人
if I stick my head in the sand,

610
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,580
我亏欠的另一个人就要陷入大麻烦了
pretending Mike isn't who I know he really is.

611
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,840
这种境地确实两难
That's a shitty situation to be in.

612
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,190
对  所以我准备问你一些事情
Yeah, it is, so I'm going to ask you something,

613
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,950
但我需要你诚实回答我
but I need you to be honest with me.

614
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,210
迈克还在处理起诉改造公司的那个案子吗
Is Mike still working on the case against Reform Corp.?

615
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,920
是的  哈维  而且我该告诉你
He is. And for the record, Harvey,

616
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,490
是他告诉我如果你问起
he told me that if you asked,

617
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,340
就把你想知道的事毫无保留地告诉你
to tell you everything you wanted to know.

618
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,780
他现在具体在做什么
What exactly is he doing?

619
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,440
他正在整理刑事案卷
He's trying to build a criminal case

620
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,160
以便交给安妮塔・吉布斯
to give to Anita Gibbs,

621
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,570
他有权这么做
which he has every right to do.

622
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,740
因为在他所签的协议上
Because the agreement he signed

623
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,380
明文禁止的只是民事诉讼
only precluded a civil suit.

624
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,450
没错
Exactly.

625
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,910
他处理到什么程度了
How far along is he?

626
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,290
我不知道  但按我对他的了解
I don't know, but knowing Mike,

627
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,820
相比今早  他肯定
I'm sure he's a hell of a lot closer

628
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,230
离胜利又近了一大步
than he was this morning.

629
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:44,940
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

630
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,940
你想不想点瓶玫瑰葡萄酒
Do you want to share a bottle of rosé?

631
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,940
我还记得上次我们点了之后
I think I remember what happened the last time

632
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,930
发生的事
we did that.

633
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,720
那就更要点了
All the more reason to get it, then.

634
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,530
我很同意
I couldn't agree more.

635
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,520
既然已经点好了
Good, now that that is decided...

636
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,680
周年纪念日快乐
Happy anniversary.

637
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,630
莎士比亚的十四行诗
Shakespeare's sonnets.

638
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,960
人人都在谈论他
Everyone is talking about this guy.

639
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,040
显然他现在正当大热
Apparently he's all the rage right now.

640
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,130
这是我大学时最喜欢的课
This was my favorite class in college.

641
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,320
你是怎么知道的
How did you know?

642
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,590
我做了功课
I do my homework.

643
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,560
谢谢
Thank you.

644
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,600
-怎么了  -没什么
- What? - Nothing.

645
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,990
和一个听不懂话的男人
It's just so nice to be with a man

646
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,290
工作一整天后  能和如此体贴的男人
who's so thoughtful after spending all day with a man

647
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,250
共度时光真是太好了
who doesn't even know what the word means.

648
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,220
是指哈维
Talking about Harvey.

649
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,970
他要离开律所
He's leaving the firm, 

650
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,900
他想当然地认为我会跟他走
and he just assumed that I would go with him.

651
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,050
他甚至没有先跟我商量
He didn't even think to ask me first.

652
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,310
今晚是庆祝之夜
We're celebrating tonight.

653
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,440
我们别聊哈维了
Let's not talk about Harvey.

654
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,860
我不是在聊哈维  我是在聊我的人生
I'm not talking about Harvey; I'm talking about my life,

655
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,520
以及我被迫要作出的一项重大决定
and a huge decision that I have to make.

656
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,370
-慢着  -你真的在考虑跟他离开吗
- Wait a second--you're actually thinking about going with him?

657
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,690
哪怕他如此对你
Even after the way he treated you?

658
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,170
我不知道我要怎么做
I don't know what I'm going to do.

659
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,580
如果我说我希望你留在
Well, what if I said that I'd like you to stay

660
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,580
皮尔逊・哈德曼呢
at Pearson Hardman?

661
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,220
-为什么这样说  -你知道为什么
- Why would you say that? - You know why.

662
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,520
因为在我们的关系中哈维如同静默的第三者
Because Harvey's like a silent partner in our relationship.

663
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,450
我们甚至无法在他的名字不出现
I mean, we can't even get through a dinner

664
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,570
的情况下好好享用晚餐
without his name coming up.

665
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,140
马克  我特别交待过他今晚别打扰我们
Mark, I specifically told him not to interrupt us tonight

666
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,280
所以他不会出现
so he wouldn't come up.

667
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,450
但他会以其他方式出现
And yet he came up anyway.

668
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,480
-马克  -听着
- Mark-- - Look,

669
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,120
我不会假装自己像你那么有洞察力
I don't pretend to be as insightful as you are,

670
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,650
但如果他要求你离开你热爱的工作
but if you can't even separate yourself from him

671
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,120
你却仍无法离开他
when he's asking you to leave a job that you love...

672
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,190
我只能好奇你到底是否真的热爱这份工作
makes me wonder if it's really the job you love after all.

673
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,970
你想让我说什么  马克
What do you want me to say, Mark?

674
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,910
我希望你说从今往后你不会
I want you to say that you're not going to follow the guy

675
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,950
只要他去哪儿你就跟着去哪儿
wherever he goes for the rest of your life.

676
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,240
我不会这么说的
I'm not going to say that.

677
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,630
好吧  那我想我是得到答案了
Okay, well, I guess I have my answer, then.

678
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:49,980
瑞秋  你不会相信...
Rachel, you are not going to believe--

679
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,690
迈克  在你说话之前
Mike, before you say anything...

680
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,450
哈维问我你是否仍在跟改造公司那个案子
Harvey asked me if you were still going after Reform Corp.,

681
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,810
我告诉他  是的
and I told him that you were.

682
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,160
没关系  因为我赢定了
Doesn't matter, 'cause I got 'em.

683
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,150
什么
What?

684
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,310
加洛告诉我马斯特森过去一直利用改造公司的囚犯
Gallo told me that Masterson was using Reform Corp.'s inmates

685
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,330
建造新监狱
to build new prisons.

686
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,420
私营企业使用囚犯是违法的
Okay, but using inmates for private companies is illegal.

687
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,400
本来是  但五年前
It would be, except five years ago,

688
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,220
亚历克斯・威廉姆斯从州惩教中心当局
Alex Williams got a waiver from the state corrections board

689
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,670
拿到了放弃书  允许他们用囚犯增补劳动力
allowing them to supplement their workforce with inmates.

690
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,950
那为什么是犯罪
So where's the crime?

691
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,580
慢着  为什么马斯特森的预算表
Wait a second. Why are Masterson's budgets

692
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,320
出现在改造公司的电子邮件服务器
on Reform Corp.'s email server?

693
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,330
更重要的是  为什么工人薪水
More importantly, why are the labor costs

694
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,970
只占了他们向本州申报的五分之一
1/5 of what they submitted to the state?

695
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,200
天呐
Jesus.

696
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,670
迈克  他们不仅仅是在用囚犯充补劳动力
Mike, they didn't just use the inmates to supplement the workforce; 

697
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,720
而是工人本身就是囚犯
the inmates were the workforce.

698
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,200
也就是说改造公司不只是延长刑期
Which means Reform Corp.'s not just extending sentences,

699
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,730
他们欺骗了州政府
they're defrauding the state,

700
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,310
而且他们还与马斯特森把利润五五分
and they're splitting the profits with Masterson, 50/50.

701
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,640
迈克  你是从哪里拿到这些资料的
Mike, where did you get all this?

702
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,630
这重要吗
What does that matter? 

703
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,920
很重要  因为如果这是从马斯特森流出的
It matters because if it came from Masterson,

704
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,730
那哈维能防止安妮塔・吉布斯用这资料
then Harvey can stop Anita Gibbs from using it.

705
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,860
这不是
Well, it didn't.

706
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,780
而是本杰明从改造公司的服务器上查到的
Benjamin got it from Reform Corp.'s server,

707
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,980
我们能整理马斯特森的资料然后交给吉布斯
which means we can redact Masterson, give it to Gibbs,

708
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,740
然后她就可以自己把各种资料整合起来
and she can put the pieces together herself.

709
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,200
哈维对此无能为力
There is nothing that Harvey can do about it.

710
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,900
迈克  他可能会因此而解雇你
Mike, he could fire you for this.

711
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,540
瑞秋  记忆中我如同被撕成两半
Rachel, I've been torn up trying to reconcile

712
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,080
痛苦地试图调和这两个不同的自己
two parts of myself for as long as I can remember:

713
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,370
无偿服务对公司法
pro bono versus corporate law.

714
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,490
如果他想解雇我  那就让他解雇吧
If he lets me go, then he lets me go.

715
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,590
你好
Hello?

716
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,350
我是路易・利特
I'm Louis Litt,

717
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,110
预约了9点来这里的
here for my 9:00 A.M. appointment.

718
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,560
有人吗
Hello?

719
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,930
你好  利特先生
Hi, ya, Mr. Litt.

720
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,650
我们一直在等你
We've been expecting you.

721
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,770
不好意思  你这是德国口音吗
I'm sorry, but did you just speak in a German accent?

722
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,040
请入坐
Please, taken ze seat.

723
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,230
我的天  你这个该死的纳粹
Holy shit, you're a goddamn Nazi.

724
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,450
你刚说什么
What did you just say to me?

725
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,000
我说就是跟你聊天气
I said I'm not going to sit here

726
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,950
我都不愿意  更别说向你敞开心扉了
and talk to you about the weather, let alone my goddamn feelings.

727
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,930
谢谢  但我不用了  维也纳炸牛排
Thanks, but no thanks, wiener schnitzel.

728
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,450
别这样  路易
Please, Louis.

729
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,900
给我两分钟
Just give me two minutes.

730
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,850
就两分钟
Two minutes.

731
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,370
首先...
First of all...

732
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,340
我想你是犹太人吧
I take it you're Jewish?

733
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,060
对  但现在回答这个问题会让我不舒服
Yeah, I'm not comfortable answering that right now.

734
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,340
好吧  显而易见
Well, it seems very clear,

735
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,950
鉴于你刚刚称我为纳粹
based on the fact that you just called me a Nazi.

736
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,030
你想说的是什么
What's your point?

737
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,050
如果我说我也是犹太人你会对此感兴趣吗
Would it interest you to know that I'm Jewish too?

738
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,510
拿出你的割礼证据
Yeah, well, take out your circumcised junk,

739
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,510
也许我就会相信你
and maybe I'll believe you.

740
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,950
我不打算这么做  路易
I'm not going to do that, Louis.

741
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,960
但我想说我的父母
But I will tell you that my parents

742
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,850
在二战期间还只是孩子
were both children during the war.

743
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,270
他们为了报名逃出了祖国  后来感到回归祖国
They survived by fleeing the country and felt it their duty

744
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,130
并且把我和我姐姐抚养成自豪的
to eventually return and raise both my sister and myself

745
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,910
德国人兼犹太人是他们的责任
as proud Germans and Jews.

746
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,340
所以如果你是因为
So, if you want to leave

747
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,030
不喜欢我的口音而打算离开
because you don't like the way I speak,

748
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,970
我能理解  但如果不是
I understand, but if not,

749
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,980
不如说说你今天为什么来这里
why don't you tell me what brings you here?

750
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,830
我来这里是因为无论我做什么
I'm here because no matter what I do,

751
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,660
都没有人会尊重我
nobody respects me.

752
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,710
杰西卡  我们得谈谈
Jessica, we need to talk.

753
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,730
确实
We do.

754
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,120
如果你希望我道歉...
But if you're looking for an apology--

755
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,460
我不是来这里让你道歉的
I'm not here for an apology.

756
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,670
我是来说我正在等布莱顿・古尔德律所
I'm here to tell you that I'm expecting a job offer

757
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,060
给我工作邀请
from Bratton Gould.

758
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,760
是你等...
You're expecting one...

759
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,850
还是你主动去找
or you went looking for one?

760
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,470
-这重要吗  -对我而言很重要
- Does it matter? - It does to me.

761
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,630
那你该知道我本来拒绝了一份工作
Then you should know, I was offered a job, I turned it down,

762
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,460
在你清楚表示你并不尊重我之前
and it was going to stay turned down

763
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,490
我都没有打算
until you made it crystal clear

764
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,720
接受这份工作
that you don't respect me.

765
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,440
我清楚表示的是  做主的人是我
What I made clear is that I call the shots,

766
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,320
如果你无法理解这对你的长远帮助...
and if you don't see how that helps you in the long run--

767
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,040
去他的长远
Screw the long run!

768
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,080
他们现在就要升我为合伙人
They're going to make me a partner now.

769
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,210
你根本不打算支持我
You won't even go to bat for me.

770
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,440
我告诉你  哈维
You know what, Harvey?

771
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,540
我快受够了你的那些关于我
I'm about done with your little song and dance

772
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,990
没有支持你的说法了
about how I don't have your back.

773
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,520
我从那个收发室把你挑出来
I picked you out of the goddamn mail room,

774
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,760
你所有的机会都是我给你的
and I've given you every opportunity you ever had.

775
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,250
这就是个错误
This was a mistake.

776
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,400
什么错误
What was a mistake?

777
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,780
我来这是给你个机会
I came here to give you a chance

778
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,420
让你来说服我别离开
to talk me out of leaving,

779
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,620
但是等合约来了的话  就太晚了
but when this offer comes in, it's too late.

780
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,790
出于好奇的问一句
Just out of curiosity,

781
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,890
你想让我做什么
what would you have me do?

782
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,800
你当然知道我想让你做什么
You know what the hell I'd have you do.

783
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,830
哈维  你的天赋比公司里
Harvey, you have more raw talent

784
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,890
百分之九十九的合伙人都高
than 99% of the partners in this firm,

785
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,820
但是我不会因为威胁就给你升职
but I'm not going to give you a promotion based on a threat.

786
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,210
等你准备好了  你就能得到
You'll get one when you're ready.

787
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,110
如果这些对于你来说还不够
And if that's not good enough for you...

788
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,900
那我祝你在布莱顿・古尔德一切顺利
then I wish you luck at Bratton Gould.

789
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,580
那就当我正式通知你了
Then consider this my official notice.

790
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,110
路易  我们刚才花了四十分钟
Louis, we spent the last 40 minutes going over

791
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,020
探讨了从你出生开始
every person who has shown you disrespect

792
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,420
每一个不尊重过你的人
since the day you were born.

793
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,700
你在开玩笑吗  我刚刚开始
You kidding? I'm just getting started.

794
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,240
尽管如此
Be that as it may,

795
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,330
如果我问你
if I ask you the one person

796
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,270
你最渴望哪个人的尊重
whose respect you crave the most,

797
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,180
那会是谁
who would it be?

798
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,360
不要思考  告诉我你脑海中闪现出来的
Don't dwell on it. Just say the first name

799
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,460
第一个名字
that pops into your head.

800
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,290
哈维・斯佩克特
Harvey Specter.

801
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,470
很好  他什么样
Good. What's he like?

802
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,850
他就像马龙・白兰度和超人的合体
He's like a cross between Marlon Brando and Superman.

803
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,450
怎么了
What?

804
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,040
我只是在想象这个形象
I'm just picturing.

805
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,570
这个哈维  他是你朋友吗
This Harvey, is he a friend?

806
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,600
他是我最好的朋友
He's my best friend.

807
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,300
他也认为你是他最好的朋友吗
Would he describe you as his best friend?

808
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,660
你这是什么意思
What the--what the fu-- is that supposed to mean?

809
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,860
-路易...  -你个混蛋
- Louis-- - You son of a bitch.

810
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,360
你是在暗示我没有他好吗
Are you implying that I'm not as good as him?

811
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,310
我没有用吗
That I'm worthless?

812
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,110
那你应该知道  你这个本该是犹太人的纳粹
Well you know what, you Nazi supposed Jew,

813
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,450
我不需要听你说这些
I don't need to take that from you.

814
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,720
我要离开这
I'm goddamn out of here!

815
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,460
这太好了  路易
Louis, this is wonderful.

816
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,850
你到底在说些什么
What the hell are you talking about?

817
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,900
大多数人要花很多年才能显露真实的自己
Most people take years to reveal their true selves.

818
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,050
但是你  你就像没有皮肤的人
But you, you are like a man without skin.

819
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,980
我可以看透你
I can see right through you.

820
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,560
这太棒了
This is fantastic.

821
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,390
这怎么就棒了呢
How the hell is this fantastic?

822
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,100
因为我可以帮你
Because I can help you.

823
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,570
你的不尊重感是内在的
Your feelings of disrespect are internal,

824
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,300
你把这个感觉投射到你面前的人身上
and you project them onto the people in front of you,

825
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,700
而在你的生活中
and in your life,

826
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,340
被你投射这种感觉的人就会以不尊重你为回应
those people throw that disrespect back at you.

827
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,090
我不会这样对你
Well, I'm not going to do that to you.

828
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,810
我会陪在你身边
I'm going to be here for you.

829
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,090
这听起来就是胡扯
That sounds like a load of crap.

830
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,040
听我说
Listen to me.

831
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,770
如果你一直这样对待别人的话
If you keep treating the people in your life like this,

832
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,580
你只会把他们推远
you're going to push them away.

833
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,610
你知道吗  医生
You know what, doc?

834
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,220
杰西卡逼我来这里的  我做了
Jessica made me come here, and I did.

835
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,590
现在我来过了  也清楚的证明了
And now that I have, it's crystal clear

836
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,520
我根本不需要心理医生
the last thing I need in the world is therapy.

837
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,160
路易  冷静下来  你要把地毯走出洞了
Louis, calm down, you're wearing a hole in the carpet.

838
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,290
抱歉  唐娜  哈维说要开个紧急会议
Well, I'm sorry, Donna, Harvey called an emergency meeting.

839
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,020
你指望我怎么做
What do you expect?

840
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,630
我指望你控制一下自己
I expect a little self-control.

841
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,310
很好  你到了
Good, you're here.

842
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,860
格蕾琴说等不及了  发生什么事了
Gretchen said it couldn't wait--what's going on?

843
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,690
我有个行动要执行  但是在我执行之前
I've got a move I want to make, but before I do,

844
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,410
我想要大家投票表决一下
I want to put it to a vote.

845
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,940
-什么样的行动  -很大的
- What kind of move? - A big one.

846
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,290
哈维  这个和你与亚历克斯和迈克之间的
Harvey, does this have something to do with the fight

847
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,890
争吵有关系吗
between you, Alex, and Mike?

848
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,380
有  我有理由相信
Yes, and I have reason to believe

849
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,590
这场争吵并没有完
that fight's not over.

850
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,470
哈维  发生了什么
Harvey, what's going on?

851
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,620
亚历克斯被人握住了把柄
Alex has a gun to his head,

852
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,550
如果我什么都不做的话
and if I don't do something about it,

853
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,260
他就有大麻烦了
he's going to be in some deep shit.

854
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,570
我有个办法
I have a way out of it,

855
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,390
但是会有一些后果
but there's going to be some consequences.

856
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,500
-对谁  -对迈克
- For who? - For Mike.

857
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,210
哈维  还有别的办法吗
Harvey, is there any other way out of this mess?

858
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,230
如果有的话  我不会站在这了
If there were, I wouldn't be standing here.

859
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,130
那告诉我们你想要做什么
Then tell us what you want to do,

860
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,600
长痛不如短痛
and let's get this over with.

861
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,430
别告诉我这是一年前那个你提过的
Don't tell me this is the "Two partners for the price of one"

862
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,010
一份代价两个合伙人的提议
idea you pitched me a year ago?

863
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,660
是的  但是哈维・斯佩克特
It is, but Harvey Specter

864
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,280
和我们有过的律师都不一样
isn't like any lawyer we've ever had.

865
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,520
他最好是这样
Well, he's better not be,

866
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,540
既然他有勇气要出这种天价
if he has the balls to ask for the moon and stars like this.

867
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,190
问题是  我已经给世达律师事务所的人
Look, the problem is, I already have an offer out

868
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,540
发出邀约了
to a hotshot at Skadden.

869
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,770
那如果他还没答应
And if he hasn't already said yes,

870
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,280
他还等些什么呢
what the hell is he waiting for?

871
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,210
我告诉你为什么  他害怕他不应付不了这里
I'll tell you what: he's afraid he can't hack it here,

872
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,410
或者是利用我们来得到更好的邀约
or he's using us to get a better offer.

873
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,210
不管怎样  哈维和我都是更好的选择
Either way, Harvey and I are a better choice.

874
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,730
好了  亚历克斯
All right, Alex.

875
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,440
看起来你们俩确实计划得不错
It looks like you two guys have your shit together.

876
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,900
但是有个问题
But here's the thing:

877
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,330
我发出了邀约  你们拒绝我
I pull this offer, and your guy says no,

878
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,270
我就什么都不剩了
I'm left here with nothing but my dick in my hand.

879
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:27,560
所以你现在告诉我你保证他会同意
So you tell right now you guarantee that he says yes.

880
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,820
你以为我不知道你想要什么吗
You think I didn't know you were going to demand that?

881
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,650
我已经和他谈过了
I already talked to him about it.

882
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,920
他答应我了
He gave me his word.

883
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,570
好  看来我要有两位新合伙人了
Okay, looks like I have two new partners.

884
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,330
但是  亚历克斯
But Alex...

885
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,770
如果事情黄了  那就是你的责任
this thing goes south, it's your ass that's on the line.

886
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,360
你在喝咖啡吗
So you're having a good coffee?

887
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,310
我们现在十一点都干这个了吗
Is that what we're doing with our 11:00s now?

888
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,220
路易
Louis.

889
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,590
你到底有什么问题
What the hell is your problem?

890
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,190
我的问题是我发现你挪了我的出庭日期
My problem is I found out you moved my court dates,

891
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,490
所以你怎么不去告诉你的工作丈夫
so why don't you go tell your work husband

892
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,760
如果他觉得我会忘了这个
if he thinks I'm going to forget about this,

893
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,930
那他就是疯了
he's got another thing coming.

894
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,720
你知道吗  路易
You know what, Louis?

895
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,010
为什么你不亲自告诉他呢
Why don't you go tell him yourself?

896
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,730
但是你最好快点  因为周一之后
But you better hurry, because as of Monday,

897
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,380
哈维就不在这上班了
Harvey doesn't work here anymore.

898
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,620
-什么  -你听到我说的了
- What? - You heard me.

899
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,010
哈维要走了  我的生活一团糟
Harvey's leaving, my life is a mess,

900
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,600
就我而言  这都怪你
and as far as I'm concerned, that's on you.

901
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,790
我  你说我是什么意思
Me? What do you mean, me?

902
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,640
如果你不明白我为什么说是你
If you can't figure out what I mean by that,

903
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,820
那你也许是个很好的初级合伙人
then you may be a good junior partner,

904
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,380
但是你人生的路还有很长一段要走
but you got a long way to go as a human being.

905
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,730
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

906
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,950
你为什么问我来这做什么
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

907
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,860
你想要阴谋  我找到了
You wanted a conspiracy, I got you one.

908
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,370
我不想要你的任何东西  我还要说
I don't want anything from you, and for the record,

909
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,650
而且我一开始就不该相信你
I was a fool to think I could trust you in the first place.

910
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,310
安妮塔  我不懂你在说些什么
Anita, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

911
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,240
别在这装傻了
Don't play dumb with me.

912
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,470
皮尔逊-斯佩克特律师事务所不只为马斯特森辩护
Pearson Specter doesn't just represent Masterson;

913
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,270
你还为改造公司辩护
you also represent Reform Corp.

914
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,550
这就意味着因为你违反了保密特权
Which means anything I get from you is tainted

915
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,230
你给我的一切都被玷污了
because you broke privilege.

916
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,500
该死  哈维肯定是刚刚签的
Goddamn it, Harvey must have just signed them.

917
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,610
所以你的意思是
So what you're saying is,

918
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,790
哈维一开始就没同意这件事吗
Harvey was never on board with this in the first place?

919
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,670
安妮塔  你还可以接这个案子  好吗
Anita, you can still take this case, all right?

920
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,060
你只要说你拿到这些证据...
You just say you received the evidence--

921
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,380
匿名的吗  我不这样认为  迈克
Anonymously? I don't think so, Mike.

922
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,510
还有一件事
And one more thing:

923
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,600
下次你想把我带入一场
the next time you're looking to involve me

924
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,000
和哈维・斯佩克特的战争中
in a war with Harvey Specter,

925
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,610
找别人去吧
go to someone else.

926
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,640
杰西卡  我听说了哈维的事
Jessica, I heard about Harvey.

927
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,190
路易  他做出了他的决定
Louis, he made his choice.

928
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,540
那不是我想要的那个选择
It's not the choice that I wanted,

929
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,060
但是我们只能接受
but we're just going to have to deal with it.

930
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,500
现在  如果你不介意的话
Now, if you don't mind...

931
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,220
事实上  我很介意
Well, actually, I do mind.

932
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,220
杰西卡  整件事都是我的错
Jessica, this whole thing was my fault.

933
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,350
是我让他陷入了不得不离开的境地  你知道的
I put him in a position where he had to leave, and you know it.

934
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,650
路易  你这样很伟大  但是...
Louis, that's big of you, but--

935
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,550
没有但是
But nothing.

936
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,470
利普希茨医生说当人不尊重自己
Doctor Lipschitz said when you don't respect yourself,

937
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,020
就会潜意识寻找别人不尊重他的迹象
you go looking for signs of disrespect in others,

938
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,190
我当上初级合伙人的方法...
and the way I got to junior partner...

939
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,480
让我无法因此尊重我自己
I don't respect myself for that.

940
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,530
你在说什么
What are you saying?

941
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,150
我是说如果导致他离开的原因是因为
I'm saying if it was my pride in refusing to admit

942
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,580
我的骄傲让我拒绝承认他是对的  而我是错的
that he was right and I was wrong that caused him to go,

943
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,340
我不会原谅自己
I won't be able to forgive myself.

944
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,650
所以请不要让他走
So please, do not let him go.

945
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,290
-路易  -怎么了
- Louis? - Yeah.

946
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,210
你之前说的是认真的吗
Did you mean what you said the other day?

947
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,680
关于律师们需要规范
About the associates needing guidance and discipline?

948
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,370
实话实说  我当时没那么想
To tell you the truth, I didn't at the time.

949
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,310
但现在是的  他们需要规范
But yes, they do.

950
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,980
作为律所的最新合伙人
Then as the firm's newest partner,

951
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,670
你愿意正式接管这些律师吗
how would you like to officially be in charge of the associates?

952
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,410
乐意之至
I'd like that very much.

953
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,390
那就好好待他们
Treat them well.

954
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,680
我会的
I will.

955
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,200
你是来告别的吗
Did you come here to say good-bye?

956
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,180
我以为咱们已经说过再见了
Because I think we already did that.

957
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,580
不  哈维
No, Harvey.

958
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,730
我来告诉你我做了
I came here to let you know that I did what

959
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,870
一开始就该做的事
I should have done in the first place.

960
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,560
什么意思
And what exactly does that mean?

961
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,990
我去见了丹尼尔  跟他说
It means I went to see Daniel, and I told him

962
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,410
如果我们的下任初级合伙人不是你
if the next person we promote to junior partner isn't you,

963
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,950
我就走
I'm leaving.

964
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,780
你为了我这样做
You did that for me?

965
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,380
有时目光长远
Sometimes playing the long game means understanding

966
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,790
意味着想明白你最终想要的队友是谁
who you want to be teammates with in the long run,

967
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,590
而我希望我最终的队友
and the person I want to be teammates with in the long run

968
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,010
是你
is you.

969
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,710
但愿现在还为时不晚  哈维
I hope I'm not too late, Harvey,

970
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,490
但如果太迟了
but if I am,

971
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,320
我也真的希望你在布莱顿・古尔德一切顺利
I really do wish you luck at Bratton Gould.

972
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,440
哈维  亚历克斯・威廉姆斯刚打电话了
Harvey, Alex Williams just called.

973
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,100
木已成舟  无法反悔
Says it's a done deal.

974
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,450
但我要说  我本愿意跟你一块儿去
For the record, I would have gone with you.

975
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,790
我也要说  我当初应该问你一句的
For the record, I should have asked you first.

976
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,090
-喂  -利普希茨医生
- Hello? - Dr. Lipschitz,

977
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:21,830
我是路易・利特
it's Louis Litt.

978
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,060
你是对的
Listen, you were right.

979
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,850
我的确需要一个不会被我推开的人
I do need someone who isn't going to let me push them away.

980
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,470
很高兴听到你这么说  路易
I'm very happy to hear that, Louis.

981
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,120
你觉得一周五天会不会太多了
Do you think five days a week is too much?

982
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,200
不如这周一先预约一次
Why don't we just start with an appointment on Monday

983
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,380
之后再看
and go from there?

984
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,340
好的
Sounds good.

985
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,640
你什么毛病
What the hell is wrong with you?

986
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,220
我好着呢
Nothing's wrong with me.

987
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,940
我叫你把它扔了
I ordered you to drop this thing.

988
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,550
然而你没有  那我就想法子让你扔掉
You didn't, so I figured out a way to make you drop it.

989
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,880
你认为签下改造公司
You think signing Reform Corp.

990
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,120
能解决问题吗  你真是脑子进水了
Is going to make this go away, you're out of your mind.

991
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,250
如果你真那么觉得
And if you think that's true,

992
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,840
你现在就不会站在这里
you wouldn't be in my face right now.

993
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,630
哈维  他们压榨早该恢复
Harvey, they are lining their pockets on the backs

994
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,280
自由身的人们来中饱私囊
of people who should have gone free years ago,

995
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,450
你是任由他们逃脱法律的制裁
and you're letting them get away with it.

996
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,580
我是他们的律师  不是检察官
I'm their lawyer. I'm not a prosecutor.

997
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,050
亚历克斯・威廉姆斯到底有你什么把柄
What the fu-- does Alex Williams have on you, huh?

998
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,210
没人有我的把柄
Nobody has anything on me.

999
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,290
那你为什么要这么做
Then why the hell are you doing this?

1000
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,730
因为肯定不是为了钱
'Cause there's no way it's for the money.

1001
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,420
你不明白
You don't understand.

1002
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,820
那我告诉你我明白什么
I'll tell you what I do understand.

1003
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,990
你欠他人情  而他们手里有他的把柄
You owe him something, and they have something on him,

1004
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,700
如果我都能想出来  你认为
and if I can figure that out, how long do you think

1005
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,930
事情败露还需要多久
it's gonna take before whatever it is gets out anyway?

1006
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:19,750
听我说
You listen to me.

1007
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,330
如果咱们平时能多互相支持对方
If you ever valued the times

1008
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,570
你就能理解我为什么这么做了
that we've had each other's backs, you'll have mine now,

1009
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,910
我跟你说了  我现在需要这个
because I'm telling you, I need it.

1010
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,470
那就告诉我到底怎么回事
Then tell me what's going on.

1011
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,700
恕难告知  因为我没法相信你
I'm not going to do that, because I can't trust you.

1012
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,270
我这么跟你说吧  你的任何看起来
But I'll tell you this: You lift a finger to do something

1013
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,850
都像还在办这个案子的小举动
that even looks like you're making another move on this case,

1014
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,650
哪怕只是打给奥斯卡・雷耶斯
I don't care if you're calling Oscar Reyes

1015
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,120
祝他生日快乐  你都会被解雇
to wish him a happy birthday, you're fired.

1016
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,450
你有一晚上的时间
So why don't you take the night

1017
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,760
来考虑你是否足够相信我
and decide if you trust me enough

1018
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,120
留下  还是走人
to keep working here or not.

1019
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,950
来看你的新办公室吗
You here to check out your new office?

1020
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,030
已经准备好了
Because it's ready.

1021
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,040
亚历克斯  我决定留在皮尔逊・哈德曼
Alex, I'm staying at Pearson Hardman.

1022
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,560
什么  咱们已经说好了
What? We had a deal.

1023
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,800
我知道  但是我想到了
I know that, but then I realized

1024
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,640
杰西卡是家人  没有职位值得我放弃她
Jessica's family, and no title is worth giving that up.

1025
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,940
我不管你什么想法
I don't care what you realized.

1026
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,300
我告诉汤米・布莱顿你一定会签名
I told Tommy Bratton you'd sign on the dotted line.

1027
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,510
他为了我拒绝了世达的一个红人
He pulled an offer to that hotshot from Skadden for me.

1028
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,280
我知道你很难办
I know this puts you in a bad spot.

1029
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,960
难办  你站在我面前
Bad spot? You stood in front of me,

1030
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,130
许下你的狗屁承诺  我还满怀希望
gave me your goddamn word, and I banked on that,

1031
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,100
我才不管你突然顿悟了什么
so I don't care what kind of come-to-Jesus moment

1032
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,480
你的口头协议是有法律效用的
you think you had, that shit is legally binding.

1033
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,990
如果你非得这样  那随便你
If you want to try to enforce that, go right ahead,

1034
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,300
但你觉得如果一个律所
but what does it say to the world

1035
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,210
为了让一个律师留下就要告人家
when a firm has to sue a lawyer

1036
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,660
世人会怎么看
just to get him to come there?

1037
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,360
如果我说我不再相信你呢
What's it say when I can't trust you anymore?

1038
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,870
亚历克斯  你不需要我才能成为合伙人
Alex, you don't need me to make partner.

1039
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,140
也许是吧  但你这样做太混蛋了
Maybe I don't, but this is some bullshit.

1040
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,440
我不反对
I'm not saying it's not.

1041
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,980
我知道现在我说什么都无济于事
And I know right now, my word means nothing,

1042
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,470
但我答应你
but I promise you,

1043
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,260
如果哪天你需要帮助
someday you're going to need help with something,

1044
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,560
不管是什么  我都会尽全力帮你
and no matter what it is, I'll be there for you.

1045
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,780
我欠你的
I owe you one.

1046
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,040
随便你怎么样
And you can let it go or not,

1047
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,790
但我诚恳地告诉你
but I'm telling you, man to man,

1048
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,400
我必须这么做
this is something I have to do.

1049
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,980
好  哈维  这事就这么过去了
Okay, Harvey, I'll let it go,

1050
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,690
但你还欠我一个人情
but you do owe me one,

1051
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,770
我需要的时候会兑现的
and someday I'm going to come calling.

1052
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,440
哈维  我知道你想帮亚历克斯
Harvey, I know you want to help Alex,

1053
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,060
但如果要以失去迈克为代价
but if it means losing Mike, then I have to ask,

1054
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,040
真的值得吗
is it worth it?

1055
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,700
迈克为你进了监狱
Mike went to prison for you.

1056
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,060
我知道  唐娜
I know that, Donna.

1057
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,280
哈维  亚历克斯做了什么
Harvey, what did Alex do?

1058
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,070
你欠他这么大人情
Why do you owe him?

1059
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,460
亚历克斯
Alex.

1060
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,450
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

1061
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,860
有些话要跟你说清楚
I'm here to come clean to you.

1062
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,000
哈维知道你过来吗
Does Harvey know you're here?

1063
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,140
不知道  事实上他叫我不要找你
No--in fact, he told me not to talk to you at all,

1064
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,000
但你有权知道真相...
but you have a right to know the truth, and...

1065
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,260
我已经厌烦被这件事威胁了
I'm tired of having this whole thing hanging over my head.

1066
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,760
进来说吧
Come on in.

1067
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,320
亚历克斯告诉布莱顿我不去了之后
After Alex told Bratton that I wasn't coming,

1068
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,460
公司把他贬的一无是处
he was nothing.

1069
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,270
交给他毫无胜算的案子
They gave him unwinnable cases

1070
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,080
还让他每天工作10小时以上
and worked him 90 hours a week

1071
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,730
直到有一天  布莱顿告诉他
until one day, Bratton came to him

1072
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,700
有一个办法挽回
and said there was a way back.

1073
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,940
他需要做的就是
All he had to do was take on

1074
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,910
接下马斯特森建筑公司的委托
Masterson Construction as a client.

1075
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,580
-是的  -他答应了
- Exactly. - And he said yes.

1076
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,740
我当然同意了
Of course I said yes.

1077
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,310
没什么危险
There were no red flags.

1078
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,180
犯人工作的弃权书只是一些生意上的事
The waiver that put inmates to work was just smart business.

1079
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,120
表面上看都是合法的
On the surface, everything was legit.

1080
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,610
那你是怎么发现那不合法的
So how'd you figure out it wasn't?

1081
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,290
一天我在布伦斯维克监狱
One day, I was at Brunswick,

1082
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,450
警卫递给我一张纸条
and a guard gave me a letter.

1083
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,060
上面写着有犯人在工地上死了
It said an inmate had died on the job site,

1084
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,660
但事情被挡下来了
and that it was being covered up.

1085
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,910
我猜猜  你告诉了马斯特森的首席执行官
Let me guess: you took it to Pat Kreuger,

1086
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,700
派特・克鲁格
Masterson's CEO,

1087
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,200
他说会着手调查
and he said that he'd look into it.

1088
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,290
两周后  那个警卫被犯人杀了
Two weeks later, that guard was murdered by an inmate.

1089
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,240
天呐
Holy shit.

1090
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,800
那时候他才知道马斯特森建筑公司
And that's when he knew Masterson and Reform Corp.

1091
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,220
和改造公司一开始就密谋好了
had been colluding from the start.

1092
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,100
然后他怎么做的
So what did he do?

1093
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,650
他去找了管理合伙人
He went to his managing partner,

1094
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,530
汤米・布莱顿说这不是两党勾结
and Tommy Bratton said it wasn't collusion between two parties.

1095
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,460
而是三党勾结
It was collusion between three parties.

1096
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,930
他们把我的津贴和关键日期都联系到一起
They tied all my bonuses to all the key dates...

1097
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,870
-放弃书  -建筑的开始
- The waiver... - The start of construction...

1098
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,000
-警卫的死  -看起来都像
- The guard's death... - It looked like

1099
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,350
我精心策划的这整起事件
I orchestrated the whole damn thing.

1100
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,940
所以你掩盖了谋杀的事实
So you covered up a murder?

1101
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,280
我没有证据
I had no proof of anything.

1102
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,350
我有妻女  而我又脱不了干系
I had a wife and daughter, and it looked like I was in on it.

1103
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:24,030
哈维  这太可怕了  但与你无关
Harvey, that's horrible, but this isn't on you.

1104
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,760
亚历克斯可以打匿名举报电话啊
Alex still could've made a call anonymously.

1105
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,340
如果你发现迈克是个骗子你也会打的
And so could you when you found out Mike was a fraud.

1106
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,050
你不是罪犯  但你的手也不干净了
You didn't have to be a party to a crime, but you were.

1107
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,070
他的罪不是谋杀
That crime wasn't a murder.

1108
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,140
你听我说了吗  唐娜  他们有他的把柄
Did you hear me, Donna? They had him.

1109
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,050
我有妻子有女儿  而他们陷害我
I had a wife and daughter, and they set me up.

1110
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,260
我能怎么办
What was I supposed to do?

1111
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,290
迈克  我恨这些人
Mike, I hate these people.

1112
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,180
他们就该下地狱
They deserve to go away for what they did,

1113
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,240
我日日夜夜都希望
and every morning when I woke up and every night

1114
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,810
让他们从世界上消失
when I went to sleep, I wanted to make that happen,

1115
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,360
但我没有  原因只有一个
but I didn't, for one reason:

1116
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,770
我不想让女儿失去父亲
I didn't want my daughter to grow up without a father,

1117
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,730
如果你还穷追不舍的话
and if you pursue this,

1118
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,530
我没有办法不卷入这场阴谋
there's no way I don't get caught up in it.

1119
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,850
-你并不确定  -不  我确定
- You don't know that. - Yes, I do.

1120
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,500
布莱顿不放过我们的客户
When Bratton came after our clients,

1121
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,080
亚历克斯签下声明揽下全责
Alex signed a declaration saying he took full responsibility.

1122
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,280
哈维  如果你想让迈克就这么过去
Harvey, if you're asking Mike to let this thing go...

1123
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,600
我不知道我能不能做到
I don't know if I can do that.

1124
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,440
我没有让你放下
I'm not asking you to let it go.

1125
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,420
而是告诉你如果你不放下会发生什么
I'm telling you what will happen if you don't.
