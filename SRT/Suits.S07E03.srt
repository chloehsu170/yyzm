16
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,610
我得说
I have to say...

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,220
这一天我等了好久了
I've been wanting this for so long.

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,750
我最疯狂的梦中也不敢想象这会成真
Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would come true.

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,400
冠名合伙人现在只剩我们了  路易
We're the only name partners now, Louis.

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,210
我那话是真心的
And I meant it when I said it.

21
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,910
我希望我们能分享这样的事
I want us to share things like this.

22
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,050
我现在的开心简直无法言表
I can't tell you how happy that makes me.

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,290
你不会要哭吧
You're not gonna cry, are you?

24
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,430
开玩笑吗  我上次在这里哭
Are you kidding? The last time I cried in here,

25
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,380
破坏了酸碱度
I messed up the pH.

26
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,860
患了数周的酵母菌感染
I had a yeast infection for weeks.

27
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,550
你不会做另一件你告诉我你在
You're not gonna do the other thing you told me

28
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,000
泥巴里做过的事吧
you did in the mud, are you?

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
哈维  我说了  那事仅此一次
Harvey, I told you, that was a one-time thing.

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,130
相信我  你可不是蜜西・蒂特乐
And believe me, you're no Missy Dietler.

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
蜜西・蒂特乐是谁
Who's Missy Dietler?

32
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,030
-他怎么来了  -什么意思
- What is he doing here? - What do you mean?

33
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,110
哈维和我经常一起泥浴
Harvey and I go mudding together all the time.

34
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,590
你还是赶紧出来
So why don't you lug yourself out of there

35
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,940
-把我的浴缸还给我  -这是我的浴缸
- so I can get my tub back? - This is my tub.

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,070
你还一直跟我说  男性朋友一起洗泥浴
And you always told me it was weird for male friends

37
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,080
很奇怪呢
to mud together.

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,500
但哈维和我可不仅仅是朋友
But Harvey and I are more than just friends.

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,620
我们是死党
We're best friends.

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,010
然后你做了什么
And then what did you do?

41
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,390
你以为呢  我打给了你
What do you think I did? I called you.

42
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,490
路易  那只是个梦
Louis, it was just a dream.

43
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,020
只是个梦  那是个泥噩梦
Just a dream? It was a goddamn mud-mare.

44
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,050
你不懂吗
Don't you get it?

45
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,810
哈维让他的好哥们进了我的公司
Harvey let his buddy into my firm.

46
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,090
现在他进了我的泥
Now he's in my mud.

47
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,750
接下来呢  我走进我的浴室
I mean, what's next? I walk into my bathroom

48
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,140
而他在冲我的牙刷拉屎吗
and I find him shitting on my toothbrush?

49
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,060
路易  我们谈过的
Louis, we talked about this.

50
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,830
如果你被这种情绪左右
If you let this overwhelm you,

51
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,580
你会引起你最担心的事
you're going to bring about the thing you're most afraid of.

52
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,880
你听到我的话了吗
Did you hear me?

53
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,540
他进了我的泥
He was in my mud.

54
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,330
我怎么可能不被这个影响
How the hell am I not supposed to let that overwhelm me?

55
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,810
好吧
Well...

56
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,650
你有没有想过
has it occurred to you

57
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,160
可以不去担心这个叫亚历克斯的
that instead of worrying this Alex person

58
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,040
会插在你和哈维之间
is going to come between you and Harvey,

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,510
而可以以此为契机
you could use this as an opportunity

60
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,920
交个新朋友
to make a new friend?

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,560
那是我听过的最蠢的话了
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

62
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,670
尽管如此
Be that as it may,

63
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,100
在我看来
as I see it,

64
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,730
你有机会多交一个朋友
you have a chance to have one more friend

65
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,350
也可能失去一个朋友
or one less friend.

66
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,260
我建议你选择朋友数量增长的
I suggest you go with one more.

67
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,990
-唐娜  -瑞秋
- Donna. - Rachel.

68
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,550
你们需要点什么吗
Can I get you two anything?

69
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,270
咖啡  茶  《星期日时报》上关于你的文章
Coffee, tea, a copy of your article in the "Sunday Times"?

70
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,560
不需要  昨天就看了  家里也有一份
Don't need it. Read it yesterday. Have one at home.

71
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,900
其实是十份
And by one, he means ten.

72
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,070
确定不想再看一遍吗
Are you sure you don't want to take just one more look at it?

73
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,610
不用了  谢谢  唐娜
I'm good. Thanks, Donna.

74
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,750
那好吧
Okeydokey.

75
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,350
祝你们愉快
You have a nice day.

76
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,580
她不太对劲  我看得出
Something's going on with her, I can tell.

77
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,360
什么意思
What do you mean?

78
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,840
你没注意到她在坏笑吗
You telling me you didn't notice that grin on her face?

79
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,910
瑞秋  你是比我认识唐娜更久
Rachel, you've known Donna longer than I have,

80
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,020
但我没看出她在坏笑
but I didn't see a grin.

81
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,650
我说了  我觉得是你想多了
I'm telling you, I think you're imagining it.

82
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,220
嗯  完全是想多了
Right. Totally imagined it.

83
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,650
-哈维  -瑞秋
- Harvey. - Rachel.

84
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,370
黑色显瘦
You know, black can be slimming.

85
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,390
下次要考虑到
Something to think about next time.

86
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,020
我想这是你在道歉
I take it this is your way of apologizing

87
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,890
说什么就不该再雇我回来
for saying you never should've hired me back.

88
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,320
也借机告诉你显瘦的问题
And it gave me a chance to say the slimming thing.

89
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,880
抱歉  迈克
Sorry, Mike.

90
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,410
你说得对  哈维
You had a point, Harvey.

91
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,340
这是光芒科技的合并案
This is the Radiant Technologies merger.

92
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,190
没错  该办我的案子了
Yep. Back to one for me.

93
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,510
好  但这事你不需要我
Great, except you don't need me for this.

94
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,050
已经完成了  明天就签了
Deal's done. They sign tomorrow.

95
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,100
所以克莱恩・罗宾森才以为
Which is why Klein Robinson thought that I wouldn't mind

96
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,520
我不介意他们临时改动一下合同
if they put a few last-minute changes in the contract.

97
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,090
临时改动  等于说在
And a few last-minute changes means they're trying to 

98
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,790
最后搞鬼
pull some last-minute bullshit.

99
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,430
这听起来很像那个文章里报道
Now that sounds like the impressive young lawyer

100
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,720
厉害的年轻律师会说的话
I read about in the article.

101
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,520
你去查查他们在搞什么
Why don't you figure out what they're trying to do?

102
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,440
午饭之前搞定
And get it done by lunch.

103
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,860
谁说我需要显瘦
Who says I need slimming?

104
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,820
*看到钱  就愿意留下吃饭*
*See the money, wanna stay for your meal*

105
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,400
*给你太太再拿块馅饼*
*Get another piece of pie for your wife*

106
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,760
*所有人都想知道那感觉*
*Everybody wanna know how it feel*

107
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,980
*所有人都想见见那景象*
*Everybody wanna see what it's like*

108
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,260
*豆子馅饼我也愿吃  我不在乎*
*I'll even eat a bean pie, I don't mind*

109
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,500
*我和妹子忙着赚钱*
*Me and Missy is so busy, busy making money*

110
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,380
*好了*
*All right*

111
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,230
*退开点  我要跳舞*
*All step back, I'm 'bout to dance*

112
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,410
*美钞爵士摇摇摇*
*The greenback boogie*

别敌意
Don't be hostile.

116
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,680
路易  你在干什么
Louis, what are you doing?

117
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,980
-什么  -别去烦他
- What? - Leave him alone.

118
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,920
他第一天上班
It's his first day.

119
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,060
不  唐娜  不是那样  我没有敌意
No, Donna, it's not like that. I come in peace.

120
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,580
你发誓
You swear?

121
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,720
是啊  我给他买了活物
Yes, I brought him a living thing.

122
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,420
-有毒吗  -不  唐娜  没有
- Is it poisonous? - No, Donna, it is not.

123
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,890
好吧  我盯着你呢
Okay. Well, I got my eyes on you.

124
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,060
还有那植物
And that plant.

125
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,540
别敌意
Don't be hostile.

126
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,580
亚历克斯・威廉姆斯  我是路易・利特
Alex Williams, Louis Litt.

127
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,840
我给你带了盆金银花
I brought you a honeysuckle.

128
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,270
什么
Excuse me?

129
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,420
是个好意  因为我们初识时
It's a gesture, since we might've gotten off

130
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,400
可能闹得不愉快
on the wrong foot.

131
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,290
你是指你企图偷走我最大的客户
You mean because you tried to poach my biggest client

132
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,560
还想阻止我加入公司
and keep me from joining the firm?

133
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,250
对  好像就是我们闹的那个不愉快
Yes, perhaps that's the foot we got off on.

134
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,920
但我希望  我们可以弄得愉快一些
But I was hoping we could get onto other foot.

135
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,910
给
Here.

136
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,750
多谢好意  路易
I appreciate the gesture, Louis.

137
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,810
对了
By the way, 

138
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,510
你在安德森案上的表现太厉害了
your work on the Andersen case was extraordinary.

139
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,840
你关注了我的安德森案
You followed my Andersen work?

140
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,670
是啊  这让我想到了我的普莱豪斯策略
Yes. In fact, it reminded me of my Pricehouse strategy.

141
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,970
老实说  我就是根据普莱豪斯策略来的
Truth be told, I based it on your Pricehouse strategy.

142
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,420
不是吧  那你是更上一层楼了
Get the f--well then, you took it to a whole other level.

谢谢  路易
Thank you, Louis.

144
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,320
抱歉我偷你客户
I'm sorry about the poaching.

145
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,040
没事了
Don't worry about it.

146
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,190
你想一起吃午饭吗
Hey, would you like to grab lunch?

147
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,470
可不该用在办公室吃午饭庆祝第一天上班
Eating at your desk is no way to celebrate your first day.

148
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,300
没错  确实不该
You're right, it's not.

149
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,600
我们一点大厅见
I'll meet you at the lobby at 1:00.

150
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,750
挺好  谢谢你的植物
Sounds good. And thanks for the plant.

151
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,790
不客气
You're welcome.

152
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,900
不知道你在意不在意  猫很喜欢它的
I don't know if you care about this, but cats love it.

153
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,420
我知道  我家有两只斑猫
Oh, I know. We've got two tabbies at home

154
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,050
特别爱这小东西
that are gonna go crazy over that bad boy.

155
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,420
-斑猫  -是的
- Tabbies? - Yup.

156
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,200
天哪  我要去订
Holy shit, I'm gonna make a reservation

157
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,290
市里最棒的餐厅  一辈子的好朋友
at the best restaurant in the city, you... BFF, you.

158
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,380
简直服了
Son of a bitch.

159
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,450
雷耶斯先生吗
Mr. Reyes?

160
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,370
-是我  -迈克・罗斯
- Yes. - Mike Ross.

161
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,560
他们说你找我
They said you wanted to see me?

162
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,080
是的  谢谢你抽空见我
Yes, thank you for taking the time.

163
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,170
不必客气
Of course.

164
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,540
我读了关于你的报道
I read your interview yesterday.

165
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,500
而且我儿子也进过监狱
And my son was in prison too.

166
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,770
但和你不同的是
But unlike you,

167
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,000
他没能坚持到出狱
he didn't make it out.

168
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,920
上面说你儿子死于心脏病
This says your son died of a heart attack.

169
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,710
对  没来由的心脏病
Yes, a heart attack out of nowhere.

170
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
你觉得他们在隐瞒什么吗
You think they're hiding something.

171
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,180
他们不肯接我电话
Well, they won't take my calls

172
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,560
也不回信
or answer my letters.

173
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,230
如果是你你怎么想
What would you think?

174
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,390
我觉得可能事有蹊跷
I'd think that there might be something wrong.

175
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,290
但也不代表就真的有
But that doesn't mean that there is.

176
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,910
罗斯先生  我儿子不过28岁
Mr. Ross, my son was 28 years old.

177
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,230
而且他再等1个月就假释了
And he was up for parole next month.

178
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,230
他们一定隐瞒了我什么
There's something they're not telling me.

179
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,320
好  我去查查看
All right, I'll look into it.

180
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,030
但是我没办法短期内就开始着手
Um, but I'm not gonna be able to get to this for a few days.

181
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,540
短期内  为何不能现在就开始调查
A few days. Why can't you start now?

182
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,900
因为我和事务所有约定  事务所愿意让我
Because I have a deal with my firm that allows me

183
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,180
接类似这样的案子  但我还要做其他案子
to do cases like this, but not only cases like this.

184
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,380
而现在  我手上就有其他案子
And right now, I'm in the middle of something else.

185
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,080
罗斯先生  上一个我接触的律师告诉我
Mr. Ross, the last lawyer I talked to

186
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,260
说有个什么条例规定
said there was some kind of a statute

187
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,460
说我在两周之内必须提起诉讼
that says I only have another two weeks to file a lawsuit.

188
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,130
那我告诉你
And I'm telling you, 

189
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,100
两周时间绰绰有余
two weeks should be more than enough time,

190
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,530
但我  不能为你的案子把其他事都放下
but I--I can't drop everything just to take your case.

191
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,580
我理解
I understand.

192
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,560
但是...
But...

193
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,070
克里斯只因为携带了1盎司大麻就进了监狱
Chris was caught with an ounce of marijuana.

194
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,160
他本来就不该进去的
He never should have been there in the first place.

195
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,380
但如果我因为时间
And if time runs out on this

196
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,390
不能为他伸张正义...
and I couldn't get him justice...

197
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,740
好
Okay.

198
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,160
我尽力而为
I'll see what I can do.

199
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,860
斯蒂芬妮  我们得谈谈这个任务
Stephanie, we need to talk about this assignment.

200
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,350
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem with it?

201
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,870
有  问题就是完成任务的不是你
Yes, the problem is you didn't do it.

202
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,980
是杰森
Jason did.

203
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,070
因为比起我  杰森更擅长编目过程
Because Jason is better at cataloging procedure than I am.

204
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,440
确实  但是如果你不练的话
Right, but if you don't do the things you're not good at,

205
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,240
你永远不会擅长
you'll never get better.

206
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,370
事实是  我其实也不是很想
The thing is, I don't really want to get better

207
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,660
擅长编目过程
at cataloging procedure.

208
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,940
我懂你的感受  就像我也并不是想当
I know that, just like I didn't want to be a paralegal

209
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,680
这么久的专事调查的法务助理
specializing in research for as long as I was.

210
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,970
但去年我们赢了一个案子
But it turns out we had a case last year

211
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,680
恰恰赢在我擅长调查
that we only won because I was outstanding at research.

212
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,960
好  我了解了
Okay, I see your point.

213
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,930
-我不会再这样了  -好
- I won't do it again. - Good.

214
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,030
因为我有另一个案子
Because I have another case that requires some procedure

215
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,790
也需要编目过程  我专门留给了你
to be catalogued, and I put it aside especially for you.

216
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,930
但斯蒂芬妮  我希望你能保证
But Stephanie, I want your word

217
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,620
你不会再推给杰森
that you won't pawn it off on Jason.

218
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,740
我向你保证
You have my word.

219
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,090
看看谁打过来了
Well, look who it is.

220
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,230
别告诉我你上次爽约很后悔
Don't tell me, you feel bad about canceling the other night

221
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,790
现在迫不及待得想补偿我
and now you're dying to make it up to me.

222
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,840
简直就像你会读心术
It's as though you read my mind.

223
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,830
这是我众多技能之一好吧
One of my many skills.

224
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,920
今晚一起吃晚餐怎么样
How does dinner tonight sound?

225
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,790
那不如就来我家吃
How does having it at my place sound?

226
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,780
狡猾如你哦
You're a crafty one, aren't you?

227
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,960
怎么  只是因为我
What? I've got some steaks

228
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,420
存了些牛排  一直想处理掉
I've been wanting to throw on the grill.

229
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,250
才不是  你想在你家吃是因为
No, you want to have dinner at your place

230
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,460
它是城区里离你卧室最近的
'cause it's the closest restaurant in the city

231
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,590
餐厅
to your bedroom.

232
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,420
你在大众点评查到的吗
Did you read that in "Zagat's"?

233
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,150
不  因为读了你的心
No, I read your mind.

234
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,730
那你知道我希望几点见面吗
Then what time am I thinking?

235
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,010
8点好不好
How about 8:00?

236
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,440
8点半吧  我还得去买牛排
Better make it 8:30. I got to go buy some steaks.

237
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,090
正想找你呢
Good, you're here.

238
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,590
快告诉我你搞清楚
Tell me you figured out what bullshit 

239
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,000
他们想在这个案子里搞什么鬼了
they're trying to sneak into this deal.

240
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,620
他们不是想在案子里搞鬼
They're not trying to sneak anything into it.

241
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,900
他们是想尽快结掉案子
They're trying to get out of it.

242
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,760
没道理啊
That doesn't make sense. 

243
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,250
他们是因为这个并购找我们的
They came to us for this merger.

244
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,530
那他们现在一定是有更好的报价了
They must've gotten a better offer,

245
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,120
因为他们在补遗里隐藏了
because they buried an escape clause

246
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,070
免除条款
in the addendum.

247
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,430
-你知道我们得干什么  -我知道
- You know what we have to do. - Yes, I do.

248
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,680
但你得自己做了
But you're gonna have to do it without me.

249
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,660
我有其他要事要做  时间很紧的那种
Something's come up, it's on a deadline,

250
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,470
而且我需要把它做好
and I need to take care of it.

251
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,970
-什么样的事情  -一个法律援助
- What kind of thing? - A pro bono thing.

252
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,500
什么时候成了给我一个给你两个了
Since when does one for me mean two for you?

253
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,360
哈维  一个囚犯死在监狱  事有蹊跷
Harvey, a man died in prison and it doesn't smell right.

254
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,990
而且我得知此事的唯一原因
Also, the only reason I found out about it is

255
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,760
是我接受你的意见  做了采访
I took your advice and did that interview.

256
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,570
所以你不帮我做案子还是我的不是了
So it's my fault that you're dropping my case?

257
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,070
对  你能这么想挺好的
Yeah, I like to look at it that way.

258
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,310
认真的  把案子办漂亮
Seriously, go get 'em.

259
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,940
谢了  哈维
Thanks, Harvey.

260
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,100
上个来看我的人送的是花
The last guy brought me a plant.

261
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,690
让我猜猜  是路易
Let me guess, the last guy was Louis.

262
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,160
-你猜对了  -我向你保证
- You got it. - Well, I guarantee

263
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,320
我的欢迎礼物一定比他的更值得期待
my welcome gift is a lot more fun than his.

264
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,260
现在连合并都值得期待了吗
Since when is a merger signing fun?

265
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,520
因为合并方打算把我们生吞活剥
Since the guys on the other side are trying to rip us off

266
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,440
还以为我们不知道
and think we don't know.

267
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,210
你之前怎么不告诉我呢
Why didn't you tell me that in the first place?

268
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,630
好啦  我路上告诉你
Come on. I'll fill you in on the way over.

269
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,820
等下  会议这么快开始吗
Wait, the meeting's now?

270
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,560
是啊  有什么问题吗
Yeah, is that a problem?

271
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,240
我和路易约了午餐
I told Louis we'd get lunch.

272
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,830
生意比午餐重要  他会体谅的
Business trumps lunch. Louis'll understand.

273
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,300
给他打个电话告知一下就行了
Just call him and let him know.

274
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,600
艾利克斯  你好  我正要去见你
Alex, hi, I was just on my way to meet you.

275
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,650
关于这事  路易  我只能改约了
About that, Louis. I have to reschedule.

276
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,830
工作上出了事  希望你能谅解
A work thing came up. I hope you understand.

277
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,890
没问题
Yeah, of course.

278
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,140
-生意重要  -谢谢体谅
-  Business comes first. - Thanks.

279
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,230
我们下次再约  事实上我这周都可以
We'll do it another time. In fact, I'm free all week.

280
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,680
路易  你还好吧
Louis? You okay?

281
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,820
在  我没事
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

282
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,250
我  那个  过敏高发季
I, uh-- it's allergy season.

283
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,350
我在想可能今天还是不一起吃饭比较好
I--I think it's probably best that we don't have lunch today.

284
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,410
我...我感觉胸闷气短
I, uh--my--my chest feels like a vice.

285
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,110
没事吧
All good?

286
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,730
应该没事
I think so.

287
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,920
不过他送了你什么植物
What kind of plant did he get you, anyway?

288
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,830
金银花
Honeysuckle.

289
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,370
我从来不知道金银花还能家养
I never knew that was an indoor plant.

290
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,420
可以家养的
Can be.

291
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,380
事实上  我家的猫会很喜欢的
Matter of fact, our cats are gonna love it.

292
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,420
-你还养猫  -你这表情什么意思
- You have cats? - Why you gotta be like that?

293
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,610
-你为什么要养猫  -我喜欢猫
- Why you gotta have cats? - I like my cats.

294
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,630
你才不喜欢
No, you don't.

295
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,280
施耐德女士  我是迈克・罗斯
Ms. Snyder? Mike Ross.

296
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,170
我应该听说过这个名字吗
Is that name supposed to mean something to me?

297
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,570
不  但我是克里斯・雷耶斯家人的律师
No, but I'm representing the family of Chris Reyes.

298
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,290
希望你熟悉这个名字
Hoping that name does.

299
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,220
当然
Of course.

300
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,940
我们对每个
Any time an inmate dies,

301
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,020
死去的囚犯都十分负责
we take it very seriously.

302
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,600
但却不足以负责到向他频繁询问
But not seriously enough to give an accounting of his death

303
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,880
死因的家属一个合理解释
despite repeated requests by his family.

304
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,960
我没有收到他家属的质询
I received no such requests.

305
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,520
你没有先来电通知拜访太可惜了
It's a shame you didn't call first.

306
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,610
我本来可以准备些什么的
I could've prepared something.

307
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,610
就是想杀你个措手不及
I didn't want you to be prepared,

308
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,610
因为我知道事有隐情
'cause I want to know what actually happened.

309
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,010
罗斯先生  当你坐了我的位子
Mr. Ross, when you do what I do,

310
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,360
就会对人们总认为你公司做坏事习以为常
you get used to people assuming the worst about your company,

311
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,680
所以希望你能稍微尊重我一点
so I would appreciate a little respect.

312
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,990
施耐德女士  当你坐了我的位子
Ms. Snyder, when you do what I do,

313
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,660
你就会习惯那些公司总是如你所料
you get used to companies proving you right,

314
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,380
所以我希望你们能有所行动
so I would appreciate a little action.

315
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,920
看来是雷耶斯先生和其他犯人打架
Apparently Mr. Reyes was in a fight.

316
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,650
他被关了禁闭
He was sent to solitary,

317
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,410
期间他声称自己呼吸困难
where he complained of difficulty breathing.

318
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,800
监狱传唤了一位医生为他治疗
A doctor was called and delivered treatment.

319
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,390
不幸的是  他于几小时后身亡了
Unfortunately, he died a few hours later.

320
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,710
如果他和犯人打架
Well, if he was in a fight,

321
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,980
那就一定有事故报告
there has to be an incident report.

322
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,090
也许  但你无权查阅
That may be, but you have no right to access it.

323
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,350
我们是私营公司  有这个特权
We're a private corporation. That's privileged.

324
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,980
好  那把目睹此事的警卫名字告诉我
Okay, then how about you give me the names of the guards who saw it?

325
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,410
你知道我是不能告诉你的
You know I can't give you that either.

326
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,930
你也知道  我如果起诉你们
And you know that if I bring a suit against you,

327
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,500
一样还是能获得这些信息
I'm gonna get all of this anyway.

328
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,380
所以你何不省省这曝光度
So why don't you save yourself the publicity

329
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,220
直接把信息给我
and just give it to me now?

330
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,250
我不在乎那上面是怎么写的
I don't care what that thing says.

331
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,160
这不是事情的全部
It's not the whole story.

332
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,150
雷耶斯先生  我知道这不是你想要的
Mr. Reyes, I know this isn't what you wanted to hear,

333
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,100
但我不认为有案可诉
but I'm not seeing a case.

334
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,240
上面说我儿子是在单独禁闭室死的
It says there that my son died alone in solitary confinement.

335
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,980
他们为什么不把他送到医务室
Why didn't they take him to an infirmary?

336
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,190
因为有医生来给他治疗了
Because he was seen by a doctor.

337
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,050
关于他的症状是有解释的
There was an explanation for his symptoms.

338
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,690
我知道你觉得我只是不能接受自己孩子的死亡
I know you think I'm just a man who can't accept his child's death.

339
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,480
但不是这样的
But that's not true.

340
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,430
雷耶斯先生  在监狱打架确实可能让人心率上升
Mr. Reyes, a fight in prison can elevate your heart rate.

341
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,960
我对这一点最清楚不过的了
Nobody knows that better than I do.

342
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,010
他们给的理由说得通
What they're saying happened is plausible.

343
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,550
那是因为你不了解我儿子
Then you didn't know my son.

344
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,750
我告诉过你  他下个月就能假释出狱
I told you, he was up for parole next month.

345
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,520
他根本就不会和别人打架
He wouldn't have gotten into a fight.

346
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,400
你到底想说什么
What exactly are you saying?

347
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,180
一定是有犯人故意去找他麻烦
One of those inmates must have come for him.

348
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,520
而监狱不在乎克里斯
And that prison didn't give enough of a shit about Chris

349
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,850
没能保护他
to protect him.

350
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,180
雷耶斯先生  我知道你来找我
Mr. Reyes, I know that you came to me

351
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,090
是因为那篇文章上说我希望能帮助百姓
because that article said I wanted to help people

352
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,670
我也确实希望  但是...
and I do, but...

353
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,300
我知道  我儿子已经死了
I know. My son's already dead.

354
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,310
但假如他们本能阻止这种事  却听之任之
But if they could've stopped this and they didn't,

355
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,850
那以后还会有类似情况
it's going to happen again.

356
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,830
蔡斯  这位是我们最新一位高级合伙人
Chase, I'd like you to meet our newest senior partner,

357
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,990
亚历克斯・威廉姆斯
Alex Williams.

358
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,840
签个合同居然劳两位高级合伙人大驾
Two senior partners just to sign a contract.

359
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,470
有点太隆重了吧
Seems excessive.

360
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,690
的确  但我们不是来签合同的
It would be, but we're not here to sign anything.

361
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,030
什么意思
What are you talking about?

362
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,650
他一定觉得我挺傻的
He must think I'm pretty dumb.

363
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,670
人们总是低估长得好看的人
People always underestimate a pretty face.

364
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,110
也许他只是觉得你傻而已
Maybe he just thinks you're dumb.

365
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,370
因为你那下耷的眼角
'Cause of the droopy eyes.

366
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,790
有道理  并非没有这个先例
Valid theory. Not unprecedented.

367
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,120
没人觉得你们傻
Nobody thinks you're dumb.

368
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,360
那你为什么把这个条款
Then why the hell did you sneak this clause

369
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,400
偷偷地加进了我的合同里
to the back of my goddamn contract?

370
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,090
我们没有偷偷加什么
We didn't sneak anything.

371
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,360
我们只是想看看还有没有其他选择
We were just looking at our options.

372
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,090
放屁  你是想用我们当幌子
Bullshit. You're trying to use us as a stalking horse

373
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,880
这样你就可以和哥本合并了
so you can merge with Gorban.

374
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,750
是又如何
So what if I was?

375
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,620
你们准备怎么阻止我
What are you going to do to stop it?

376
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,530
告诉你我是怎么做的  我找了亚历克斯
I'll tell you what I did. I called Alex.

377
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,580
而我找了我在司法部工作的法学院室友
And what I did was call my law school roommate at the DOJ

378
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,710
聊了聊你和哥本合并可能造成的垄断
about the anti-trust issues raised by you merging with Gorban.

379
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,280
你们想怎么样
What do you want?

380
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,070
我们希望你能遵守原合同的条约
We want you to live up to the terms of the original agreement.

381
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,680
除了一条
With one exception.

382
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,580
你得辞职
You're gonna take a step down.

383
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,100
-我是不会辞职的  -不  你会
- I'm not stepping down. - Yes, you are.

384
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,750
这家新公司不需要两个外聘律师
This new company doesn't need two outside counsels.

385
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,670
尤其不需要一位背着客户
Particularly one who tries to pull shady shit

386
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,410
搞小动作的律师
without his client knowing about it.

387
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,000
看来你得为了团队牺牲自己了  蔡斯
Looks like you're gonna take one for the team, Chase.

388
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,670
问题是  你是想体面地退场还是被踢出去
The question is, would you like to bow out or get kicked out?

389
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,430
我他妈怎么能平静得下来
How the hell can I calm down?

390
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,580
我眼睁睁地看着我的泥浴噩梦成真了
I was watching my mud-mare come true.

391
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,420
你不清楚你到底看到了什么  路易
You don't know what you saw, Louis.

392
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,010
抱歉  我不记得我瞎了
I'm sorry, I forgot I was blind.

393
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,270
我一定是用盲人手机打给你的
I must've dialed your number using my Braille-a-phone.

394
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,250
你知道我不是这个意思
You know that's not what I meant.

395
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,770
不  你是对的  这是唯一能解释
No, you're right, it's the only explanation

396
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,250
我为什么会不清楚我看到的东西
as to why I wouldn't know what I just saw,

397
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,270
也就是哈维和亚历克斯  手挽着手嘲笑我
which was Harvey and Alex, arm in arm, laughing at me!

398
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,690
路易  听我说
Louis, listen to me.

399
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,910
我们早知道会发生这样的事
We knew this was going to happen.

400
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,650
我会被我最好的朋友背叛这件事吗
That I was gonna be betrayed by my best friend?

401
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,980
不  是你想要努力对别人友好...
No, that you were going to try to be good--

402
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,660
-做过了  -试着不做你自己
- Did it. - Try not to be you.

403
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,680
-做到了  -然后以为发生了
- Accomplished. - Then perceive

404
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,540
一个可能并不存在的侮慢
a potentially nonexistent slight

405
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,440
直接就跳到了第七阶段
and go straight to stage seven.

406
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,020
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

407
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,450
惊恐  悲伤  自我厌恶
Panic, sorrow, self-loathing,

408
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,740
憎恨  辩解  再次自我厌恶  愤怒
hatred, justification, self-loathing again, and rage.

409
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,690
我把这叫做路易的七个阶段
I call it the seven stages of Louis.

410
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,360
你胡说八道
You are so full of shit,

411
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,070
你真是个大骗子  我会...
and you're a total fraud, and I'm actually gonna--

412
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,810
我懂你的意思了
I see your point.

413
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,150
7b阶段
Stage 7b.

414
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,790
没有人喜欢幸灾乐祸的人  斯坦
No one likes a gloater, Stan.

415
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,070
尽管如此
Be that as it may.

416
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,110
你需要制定个策略  路易
You need a strategy, Louis.

417
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,610
为了现在和下次再发生这种情况的时候
For now and the next time this happens.

418
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,620
呼吸练习
The breathing exercises.

419
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,550
那是对你有用的唯一办法
It's the only thing that's ever worked for you.

420
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,280
没有你我可怎么办  医生
What would I do without you, Doc?

421
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,120
不必想这个问题  我的朋友
No need to go down that road, my friend.

422
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,150
现在  想象你自己在靠近海的地方
Now, picture yourself near the ocean,

423
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,940
躺在沙子上
laying in the sand.

424
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,440
很好  不是吗
Isn't it lovely?

425
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,390
我得说  那很有趣
I got to say, that was pretty fun.

426
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,560
我也觉得
I agree.

427
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,840
我一直想假装我有个在司法部的朋友
I always wanted to pretend I had a friend at the DOJ.

428
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,320
第一天过得挺不错的
Not a bad first day.

429
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,360
说到我的第一天
Speaking of my first day,

430
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,430
路易・利特那个家伙是怎么回事
what's up with that Louis Litt guy?

431
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,140
-什么意思  -我不知道
- What do you mean? - I don't know.

432
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,960
一开始他试图阻止我来
First he tries to stop me from coming over,

433
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,280
之后他带给我一盆植物
then he brings me a plant,

434
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,550
再然后当我打电话取消午饭安排的时候
then when I called to cancel lunch,

435
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,980
我敢发誓他简直要哭出来了
I could've sworn he was about to cry or something.

436
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,910
什么
What?

437
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,870
路易这个人...
Louis is...

438
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,440
一言难尽
he's complicated.

439
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,620
什么意思  一言难尽  
What do you mean, complicated?

440
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,870
你知道他不想让你来这  对吗
Well, you know he didn't want you here, right?

441
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,970
问题是  并不是出于工作原因
The thing is, it wasn't professional.

442
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,630
那还能是什么
What else could it be?

443
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,860
他怕我会和你
He was worried that I was gonna be

444
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,500
成为比他更要好的朋友
better friends with you than him.

445
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,050
这家伙什么毛病啊
What the hell is wrong with this guy?

446
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,320
他喜欢上了你吗
Does he have a crush on you?

447
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,400
不
No.

448
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,180
是  他完全迷上我了
Yeah, he totally has a crush on me.

449
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,430
但不是那种喜欢
But not like that.

450
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,820
也许这么解释你就明白了
Maybe this'll work.

451
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,320
你看过《陆军野战医院》吗
You ever seen "MASH"?

452
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,610
当然看过  但和这又有什么关系
Of course, but what does that have to do with this?

453
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,810
路易是弗兰克・勃恩斯
Louis is Frank Burns.

454
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,260
你怎么不早说
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

455
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,860
这下我就理解了
Now I totally get it.

456
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,350
-你确定  -是的
- You sure? - Yeah.

457
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,790
他爱你  恨你  想要成为你
He loves you, hates you, and wants to be you,

458
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,110
三种感情同时存在
all at the same time.

459
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,160
你的确理解了
Huh, you do get it.

460
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,690
是的  问题是
Yeah, I do. The question is,

461
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,590
你确定我俩会没事
are you sure he's gonna be okay with me,

462
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,400
还是我得小心点
or do I have to watch out?

463
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,790
我问你
Well, let me ask you this.

464
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,610
你告诉他你的猫会喜欢他的金银花了吗
Did you tell him your cats are gonna love his honeysuckle?

465
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,570
说了
Yes.

466
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,930
那我想你肯定没事
Then I think you'll be fine.

467
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,310
打扰一下  你们认识克里斯・雷耶斯吗
Excuse me. You guys know Chris Reyes?

468
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,030
没听过
Doesn't ring a bell.

469
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,300
那就奇怪了  因为根据事故报告
That's strange, 'cause according to the incident report

470
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,380
他死的当晚是你们三个值班
the three of you were on duty the night he died.

471
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,750
就算真是如此  我也没什么好说的
Even if I were, I wouldn't have anything to say about it,

472
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,920
所以你可以滚了
so you can get the fu-- out of here.

473
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,050
别这样  我只想问几个问题  别无其他
Hey, come on. I just have a few questions, that's all.

474
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,570
这里是监狱
This is a prison.

475
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,270
所有的问题都得通过总办公室
All questions go through the main office.

476
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,570
你觉得我从哪搞到你们的名字的
Where do you think I got your names?

477
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,210
我一点都不关心你从哪搞到的
I don't give a shit where you got 'em.

478
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,660
你得忘了你听过这几个名字
You're gonna forget you ever heard 'em.

479
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,440
再让我见到你  我让你吃不了兜着走
And if I see your face again, there's gonna be a problem.

480
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,970
好了  我不是来这找麻烦的
Okay, look, I'm not trying to start any trouble here.

481
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,570
但死了人  我得弄清楚发生了什么
But a man is dead, and I need to find out what happened.

482
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,380
对于一个不是来找麻烦的人来说
For a guy who's not looking to cause any trouble,

483
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,680
你没有做到认真听别人的话
you sure don't listen too good.

484
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,930
好了  德鲁  走吧
Come on, Drew. Let's go.

485
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,120
那正是他想要的
That's what he wants.

486
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,000
我告诉你  他不值得
I'm telling you, he's not worth it.

487
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,610
你就是那种喜欢
You're one of those assholes who just love

488
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,350
被打得屁滚尿流的那种人是吗
getting the shit beat out of him, aren't you?

489
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,810
不  我被打得屁滚尿流过
No, I've had the shit beat out of me,

490
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,650
我可以告诉你  我一点也不喜欢那样
and I can tell you, I didn't love it at all.

491
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,700
那你最好快点滚出去
Then you better get the hell out of here

492
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,760
免得旧事重演
before it happens again.

493
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,700
我会的  只要你回答我的问题
I will, just as soon as you answer my questions.

494
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,030
我为什么要回答
And why would I do that?

495
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,960
因为你的名字列于名单之首
Because your name is at the top of the list,

496
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,420
我想你知道那意味着什么
and I'm guessing you know what that means.

497
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,340
是啊  我是替罪羊
Yeah, I'm the scapegoat.

498
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,590
但也意味着无论他们知道了什么
But it also means anything they get,

499
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,030
他们都知道是从我这里泄露的
they know it came from me.

500
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,410
不过你刚当着你同事的面
Except you just told me to go to hell

501
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,860
让我滚远点
in front of all your buddies,

502
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,240
他们看的出你是认真的
and they saw you meant it.

503
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,300
所以你才到监狱找我
That's why you came to me at the prison.

504
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,040
现在你有掩护了
Now you got cover.

505
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,420
我建议你好好利用
And I suggest you use it.

506
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,140
因为我一定会弄清楚到底发生了什么
Because I am gonna find out what happened here,

507
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,900
到那时  他们会为自保推卸责任
and when I do, they are gonna shield themselves from liability

508
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,170
那我只能追着你不放
and I am gonna end up coming after you instead.

509
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,740
或者你告诉我我所需要的知道的
Or you can tell me what I need to know,

510
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,230
我就不把你卷进来
and I'll leave you out of it.

511
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,190
是我分开了打架的人
I'm the one who pulled him out of the fight

512
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,620
把他关了紧闭
and threw him in the hole.

513
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,680
他开始说他呼吸有问题
He started complaining saying he was having problems breathing.

514
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,800
我告诉了我的主管
I told my supervisor, 

515
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,980
我的主管说他会叫医生来的
and my supervisor said he was gonna call the doctor.

516
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,180
-我就知道这么多  -鬼才信你只知道这么多
- That's all I know. - Bullshit that's all you know.

517
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,360
克里斯被杀是因为他知道了不该知道的事吗
Look, did Chris get killed because he was onto something?

518
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,870
-不  -那孩子
- No. - Well, that kid,

519
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,770
他不会毫无理由就卷进打架事件
he didn't just up and get in a fight without good reason.

520
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,830
你不知道你在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

521
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,020
看守受贿了吗
Look, are the guards corrupt?

522
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,800
你刚刚说什么
What the hell did you just say?

523
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,270
-是外面的什么人要教训他吗  -不  他只是死了
- Was somebody out to get him? - No, he just died!

524
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,560
没有什么阴谋诡计
Look, there's no conspiracy.

525
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,900
没有坏人
Nobody's evil.

526
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,330
只是廉价
Just cheap.

527
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,200
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

528
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,080
他们能揍他那么久的
It means the only reason they were able to wale on him

529
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,280
唯一原因
for as long as they did

530
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,400
是因为那晚值班人员不够
is 'cause they didn't have enough of us on duty that night,

531
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,920
因为监狱除了自己的收益
'cause the prison doesn't give a shit about anything

532
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,470
其他都不关心
except its bottom line.

533
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,380
那你怎么做的
So what did you do?

534
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,160
然后我告诉他钱可以收下
So I told him he could have the money,

535
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,630
但要是想拿走这些唱片
but if--if he tried taking those albums,

536
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,050
我俩就有麻烦了
we're gonna have trouble.

537
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,150
今晚真美好
This was lovely.

538
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,030
但我明天得早起
But I have an early morning tomorrow.

539
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,460
我觉得我该回家了
I think I should get home.

540
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,450
宝拉  怎么回事
Paula, what's going on?

541
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,540
没事
It's nothing.

542
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,460
-真的  -没事吗
- Really. - Nothing?

543
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,500
我们度过了美好的一
We had a great night.

544
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,230
突然你就说要走
All of a sudden you have to go?

545
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,930
你不会明白的
You wouldn't understand.

546
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,310
说说看
Try me.

547
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,050
今天我和我以前的女导师共进午餐
I had lunch with the woman who was my mentor today.

548
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,160
我们吃得很开心
And we were having a wonderful time

549
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,250
闲聊叙旧
catching up with each other,

550
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,300
然后...  突然
and then... out of the blue,

551
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,250
她问我是否有交往的人
she asked me if I was seeing anyone.

552
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,920
我说没有
I said no.

553
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,040
我们交往时间还不算长
Well, we haven't exactly been seeing each other for very long.

554
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,100
我可以理解如果你...
It's understandable if you--

555
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,800
不是这样的  哈维
No, it wasn't that, Harvey.

556
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,040
-而是我感觉有点... -什么
- It's that I felt a little... - What?

557
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,590
羞愧
ashamed.

558
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,190
羞愧
Ashamed.

559
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,670
我俩之间的关系不是闹着玩  哈维
This isn't a small thing, what we're doing, Harvey.

560
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,360
-至少对我来说不是  -对我来说也不是
- At least it's not to me. - It's not to me either.

561
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,920
我不确定自己清楚这事有多认真
Well, I'm not sure I realized exactly how not small it is

562
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,880
直到今天
until today.

563
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,470
我不明白  这事我们讨论过了
I don't understand. We've been over this.

564
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,640
规定说得很清楚
It's in writing.

565
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,630
我们交往并不违规
There's no violation with us seeing each other.

566
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,950
我不是想要逃避什么惩罚  哈维
This isn't something that I am trying to get away with, Harvey.

567
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,290
而是关于我内心的感受
It's how I'm feeling inside.

568
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,690
-所以你想说什么  -我什么都没说
- So what are you saying? - I'm not saying anything.

569
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,250
我只是说  我觉得自己今晚该回家过夜
I'm just saying I think I should sleep at my place tonight.

570
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,030
唐娜  我有话要对你说
Donna, I need to talk to you about something.

571
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,810
说什么
About what?

572
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,480
告诉你我很生气
About the fact that I'm pissed off.

573
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,880
怎么回事
What's going on?

574
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,640
我交给斯蒂芬妮・帕特尔一个任务
I gave Stephanie Patel an assignment

575
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,290
然后她把任务交给了别人
and she handed it off.

576
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,130
你跟她谈过了吗
Did you talk to her about it?

577
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,560
谈过了  她向我保证
Yes, I did, and she gave me her word

578
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,060
下不为例  但她又这样做了
that she would never do it again, but she did.

579
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,700
我不明白  这上面有斯蒂芬妮的名字
I don't understand. This has Stephanie's name on it.

580
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,190
我不管上面写着谁的名字
I don't care whose name is on it.

581
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,600
都必须由初级助理
There's no way that that wasn't written

582
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,920
亲自完成
by a first-year associate.

583
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,050
瑞秋  别告诉我你想
Rachel, please tell me you're not thinking

584
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,540
拿着这个去找路易
about going to Louis with this.

585
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,750
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

586
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,370
就因为路易和斯蒂芬妮之间的小插曲
We took Louis off the associates

587
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,090
我们才让他放手了新律师
because of his incident with Stephanie.

588
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,200
如果我告诉路易她违抗命令
If I tell him that she's being insubordinate,

589
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,790
路易会杀了她的
he'll kill her.

590
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,730
不敢相信我会说这个
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this,

591
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,400
但也许你该向路易学一招
but maybe you should take a page out of Louis' book.

592
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,850
这是什么意思
What do you mean?

593
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,570
路易刚接管新律师的时候
When Louis first took over the associates,

594
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,780
他常常会安排一个假律师
he used to plant a fake associate

595
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,560
然后在上班第一天  当众炒了他
and fire him in front of the entire class on day one.

596
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,980
我过去认为他真是疯了
And I used to think he was crazy,

597
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,270
但斯蒂芬妮从未
but Stephanie never would have pulled

598
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,560
跟路易来这一套
something like this with Louis.

599
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,690
好吧  首先
Okay, first of all,

600
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,310
这无关我的管理方式
that's just not how I operate.

601
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,450
其次  路易那招他们都见过了
And second of all, they've all been here.

602
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,280
都能看出那是演戏
They'd all be able to tell that it was fake.

603
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,240
那也许你应该真的解雇她
Then maybe you need to real fire her.

604
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,480
因为这是她再犯了  如果你继续放任自流
Because this is a second offense and if you keep letting it go,

605
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,610
何时才是个头
where does it end?

606
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,250
我不会这么做
I'm not gonna do that.

607
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,740
介意我问问原因吗
Do you mind if I ask you why not?

608
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,280
因为我不想刚上任就踢人走
Because I don't want my first official act to be firing someone.

609
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,650
我理解  瑞秋
I understand that, Rachel.

610
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,030
但你最好想点别的办法
But you better think of something.

611
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,540
因为路易一直都很明白
Because the one thing that Louis understood

612
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,440
不是你说一不二
was that you've got to come out of the gate in command,

613
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,310
就是他们骑到你脖子上
or they're gonna walk all over you.

614
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,380
你好
Yes?

615
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,020
雷耶斯先生  我是迈克・罗斯
Mr. Reyes, it's Mike Ross.

616
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,090
我去了监狱  和一个狱警谈了谈
I went to the prison, and I talked to one of the guards.

617
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,490
他怎么说
What did he say?

618
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,250
他说所有监狱都只在乎自己的收益
He said all the prison cares about is their bottom line.

619
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,150
所以我今晚会发起诉讼
So I'm filing a lawsuit tonight.

620
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,060
太谢谢你了  罗斯先生
Thank you so much, Mr. Ross.

621
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,250
我本以为那个故事不太现实
I thought that article was maybe too good to be true.

622
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,490
谢谢你这么说  奥斯卡
I appreciate that, Oscar,

623
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,980
但在我最终如你所愿之前  先别谢谢我
but don't thank me until I get you the answers you're looking for.

624
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,310
你已经把文件都做好了吗
You finished the paperwork already?

625
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,720
看来得给你升职加薪了
I might have to give you a raise.

626
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,010
把钱省省吧  哈维
Save your money, Harvey.

627
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,490
我来是想说点别的
I'm here about something else.

628
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,850
怎么了
What's going on?

629
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,950
我刚听说迈克・罗斯在处理一个无偿服务案
I just heard Mike Ross is handling a pro bono.

630
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,160
是的  我跟他有个协议
Yeah, we have a deal.

631
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,800
怎么了  你想让他做什么吗
Why? You need him for something?

632
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,320
是的  我想让他放弃这个案子
Yeah, I need him to drop that case.

633
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,670
为什么
Why?

634
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,800
因为这和马斯特森建筑公司有利益冲突
Because there's a conflict with Masterson Construction.

635
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,750
迈克的无偿服务案是针对一个监狱
Mike's pro bono is against some prison.

636
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,110
你猜是谁建的这些监狱
And guess who builds those prisons.

637
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,240
等等
Wait a second.

638
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,100
你是在说  因为你客户在欺压你
Are you telling me to go back on my word

639
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,820
所以让我出尔反尔吗
because your client's bullying you?

640
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,430
哈维  我以为我们是一条船上的
Harvey, I thought we were in this together.

641
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,150
-同意  -那就听我的
- So did I. - Then get on board.

642
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,430
因为他们不是普通客户
Because they're not just any client.

643
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,820
而是我最大的客户之一
They're one of my biggest.

644
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,900
如果因为你把一个无名囚犯放在一个
And if they leave because you chose some prisoner

645
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,820
全国大型开发商之前  导致他们离开
over one of the biggest developers in the country,

646
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,860
外界就会从中得到消息
people are gonna get the message

647
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,580
认为我们无意与房地产企业合作
that we don't want to be in the real estate business.

648
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,470
他们说过会放出这个消息吗
Did they say they were gonna give people that message?

649
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,870
-哈维  -说过还是没说
- Harvey-- - Did they or not?

650
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,060
-说了  -放弃他们
- They did. - Drop 'em.

651
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,630
-我的天  -我说放弃他们
- God damn it-- - I said drop 'em.

652
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,910
-不  -你说什么
- No. - Excuse me?

653
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,400
我可能还不是冠名合伙人
I may not be name partner yet,

654
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,190
但我要代理什么客户不用你来告诉我
but you don't get to tell me who my clients are.

655
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,440
我就是要告诉你
Yes, I do.

656
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,480
哈维  听听你自己说的话
Harvey, listen to yourself.

657
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,980
这只是个无偿服务案  他刚接手
It's one pro bono. He just took it.

658
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,300
完全可以撤诉
He can drop it.

659
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,120
我向他保证过
I gave him my word.

660
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,820
你也曾经向我保证过
And you once gave your word to me

661
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,870
然后出尔反尔  而我计较
and went back on it and I let it go.

662
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,580
因为我懂这是生意
Because I understood it was business.

663
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,250
要是这小子不懂  那他在这干嘛
If this kid doesn't get that, what the hell is he doing here?

664
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,590
斯特芬妮  我叫你来我办公室
Stephanie, I asked you to come to my office.

665
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,040
已经是一个小时前的事了
That was over an hour ago.

666
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,900
我刚刚在写桑德森简报
I was working on the Sanderson brief.

667
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,920
就准备过来了
I was about to come down.

668
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,300
我现在就跟你说
Well, I need to talk to you now,

669
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,670
因为你告诉我不会把这个移交给别人
because you told me that you wouldn't hand this off,

670
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,550
你却这么干了
and you did.

671
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,970
不  我告诉你我不会把这个移交给杰森
No, I told you that I wouldn't hand it off to Jason,

672
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,350
我确实没有
and I didn't.

673
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,780
你难道是要玩文字游戏
I'm sorry, are you trying to get out of this

674
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,140
撇清责任吗
on a technicality?

675
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,190
我是你的主管  不是你的对方律师
I'm your supervisor, not opposing counsel.

676
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,360
瑞秋  我试过委婉一点
Rachel, I tried to be nice about this,

677
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,660
但我已经当了四年律师了
but I'm a fourth-year associate,

678
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,020
不会再浪费时间
and I'm not wasting my time

679
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,910
做一些菜鸟律师做的事了
on something a first-year could handle.

680
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,320
不介意的话  我回去工作了
Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to work.

681
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,400
我介意
Actually, I do mind.

682
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,970
很抱歉  斯特芬妮  我跟你说
Excuse me, Stephanie, I'm speaking to you.

683
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,320
你当了几年律师不重要
It doesn't matter what year you are.

684
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,680
我是律师主管
I'm head of the associates.

685
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,720
我给你任务  你就得做
If I give you an assignment, you do it.

686
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,150
值得我费时间做的  我会做
And when you give me one that's worth my time, I will.

687
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,330
这是怎么了
What's going on here?

688
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,410
唐娜  我来解决
Donna, I'm handling it.

689
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,030
作为一个成年女性
What's going on is that I am a grown woman,

690
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,610
我不需要别人告诉我该做什么
and I don't need to be told what to do by someone

691
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,980
尤其是经验没我丰富的人
with less experience as a lawyer than me.

692
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,580
那你可能更不想听到没有律师经验的人
Then you're really gonna hate being told what to do

693
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,810
告诉你该做什么了
by someone with no experience as a lawyer.

694
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,840
-唐娜...  -你说什么
- Donna-- - Excuse me?

695
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,360
既然你来了我这里
I said, you're here, and I'm here.

696
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,720
如果你想给我办事
So unless you want to deal with me,

697
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,870
你就得听瑞秋的话
you'll listen when Rachel tells you something.

698
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,920
我被招募到这里来
I was recruited to come here.

699
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,640
你们告诉我  我会受到重视
And I was told that I would be valued

700
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,490
因为我的智慧  我带来的收益
for my mind, my billings,

701
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,050
我带来的客户资源
and my relationship with my clients.

702
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,160
但来了这
And since I got here,

703
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,560
我得收拾路易的烂摊子
I have had to take shit from Louis.

704
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,370
你现在还要求我浪费时间精力
And now you're asking me to waste my time and my ability

705
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,410
在这些事情上面
on something like this.

706
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,790
你没错  斯特芬妮
You're right, Stephanie.

707
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,860
你不该因为路易被这样对待
You shouldn't have been treated like that by Louis.

708
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,560
瑞秋和我会处理这件事
And Rachel and I took care of it.

709
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,630
至于你的时间精力
Now as for your time and ability,

710
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,870
如果你不好好完成瑞秋交待的任务
if you don't do whatever assignment Rachel gives you,

711
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,800
我才不管你有多优秀
I don't give a shit how good you are.

712
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,610
我们会直接让你走人
We are gonna show you the door.

713
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,270
你过来跟我说我帮了你大忙吗
Did you come by to tell me that the work I did saved your ass?

714
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,630
确实帮了大忙  但我不是为这个来
It did, but that's not why I'm here.

715
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,610
哈维  怎么了
Harvey, what's going on?

716
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,070
你得放弃公益案
You have to drop your pro bono.

717
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,430
它跟我们一个客户有冲突
There's a conflict with one of our clients.

718
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,020
什么  谁啊  我接案子之前
What? Who? I checked for conflicts

719
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,910
核实过有没有利益冲突
before I took the case.

720
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,800
-一个新客户  -既然是新客户
- It's a new client. - Well, if it's a new client,

721
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,750
那直接跟他们解约好了
then let's drop them.

722
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,440
不能  他们是一家很大的开发商
We can't. They're a huge developer.

723
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,130
开发商啊  我在起诉一家监狱
A developer? I'm suing a prison.

724
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,440
我知道  但是他们说...
I know that, but they're saying--

725
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,490
我才不管他们说什么
I don't care what they're saying.

726
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,260
这不是有冲突  这是在敲诈
That's not a conflict. That's a shakedown.

727
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,770
-迈克  -不
- Mike-- - No.

728
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,830
你打算给了我通行证
You're gonna give me the green light,

729
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,810
我找到要的东西了
and then I find something,

730
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,730
你就让我无缘无故放弃吗
and then you're gonna make me dump them for no good reason?

731
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,340
这不是没有原因啊
It's not no good reason.

732
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,010
他是亚历克斯的开发商  我刚招他进来
It's Alex's developer, and I just brought him in.

733
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,840
第一个星期就让他失去
I let him lose one of his biggest clients

734
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,590
一个大客户吗  简直是噩梦
his first week here, it's a disaster.

735
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,660
那我不伸张正义  眼睁睁看着他死吗
And I let a man die without getting him justice.

736
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,260
-这算哪门子事  -听我说...
- What the hell is that? - Listen to me--

737
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,480
你自己想想  我们说好的
Listen to yourself. We had a deal.

738
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,310
这个小丑让我
Now this clown is asking me to drop a client

739
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,460
跟我做了承诺的客户解约
that I made a promise to.

740
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,840
他没让你解约  迈克
Except he's not asking you to drop him, Mike.

741
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,560
是我  你不答应我们说好的就不算了
I am. And if you don't, that deal we made--it's over.

742
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,780
你怎么能那样做
How could you do that?

743
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,040
怎么做  我在帮你
Do what? I was helping you.

744
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,690
不  唐娜  你破坏了我的权威
No, Donna, you were undermining me.

745
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,890
破坏你的权威
Undermining you?

746
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,830
你需要支援  所以我才那么做
You needed backup. That's what I'm here for.

747
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,580
不  我需要解决问题
No, I needed to handle the situation,

748
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,430
而我正在解决问题时
which is what I was doing until you decided to interfere

749
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,590
你不清楚状况就来搅合
in something that you don't know anything about.

750
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,930
无意冒犯  瑞秋  但我确实知道情况
No offense, Rachel, but I did know something about it,

751
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,120
据我所知  你根本没法把问题解决好
and from what I could tell, you weren't handling it at all.

752
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,580
那你觉得你这样做有用吗
And you think what you did was any better?

753
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,310
我早就告诉过你要给公司定好基调
I think I told you that you need to set the tone early on.

754
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,970
你刚刚定的基调就是
Okay, and the tone that you just set

755
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,260
你要是不在  她就可以骑到我脖子上来了
is that if you're not there, she can walk all over me.

756
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,270
我不知道你在哪间办公室
Well, I don't know what room you were in,

757
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,770
但她早就爬你头上了
but she was doing that anyway.

758
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,900
要是其他律师看到我放任她这么做
And what does it say about me if the other associates

759
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,050
他们会怎么议论我
see me letting her do that?

760
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,900
你说好了相信我的领导能力
What it says is that you trust my leadership style

761
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,440
就不应该还以为你得为我抗争
instead of thinking that you need to fight my fights for me.

762
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,970
斯特芬妮需要我给她的一切
Stephanie needed what I gave her.

763
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,340
你要是以为我是在为你抗争
And if you think that was me fighting your fights,

764
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,720
你都不知道你在说些什么
you don't know what you're talking about.

765
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,990
因为如果是针对我
Because if it were up to me,

766
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,400
我早就把她炒了
I would've fired her on the spot.

767
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,320
那你怎么不炒呢
Well then, why didn't you?

768
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,740
因为他们不是我的律师
Because they're not my associates.

769
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,830
你说的对  他们是我的律师
You're right. They're mine.

770
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,520
我在努力帮你争取他们
And I fought for you to get them.

771
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,980
你刚刚在他们所有人面前
And you just belittled me

772
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,480
藐视我  羞辱我
and embarrassed me in front of all of them.

773
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,030
我以为我的朋友
And that is not something that I thought 

774
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,490
不会对我这么做
my friend would do to me.

775
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,250
我从没想过我会说下面的话
Well, you know what, I never thought I would say this,

776
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,670
也许你还没为你的新职位做好准备
but maybe you weren't ready for your new position.

777
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,850
你知道吗  唐娜
Well, you know what, Donna?

778
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,060
你也没有
Maybe neither were you.

779
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,810
利普希茨医生  我知道你还在治疗
Dr. Lipschitz, I, uh-- I know you're in a session.

780
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,820
我只是想说你是对的
I just wanted to say that you were right.

781
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,760
我反应过度了
Uh, I was overreacting.

782
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,800
我没有对亚历克斯不满
I do not have a problem with Alex.

783
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,440
如果我再有了什么情绪
And, uh, if I ever get triggered again,

784
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,050
我会深呼吸
I have the deep breathing.

785
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,190
再次感谢
Anyway, thanks again.

786
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,810
再见
Auf Wiedersehen.

787
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,800
迈克
Mike.

788
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,690
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

789
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,360
我只需要几分钟就够了  之后你随便用
This'll just take a few minutes, and then it's all yours.

790
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,160
多久并不要紧  路易
No, it doesn't matter how long it takes, Louis.

791
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,010
反正跟客户收到钱就行了  对吧
We can just charge the time back to some client, right?

792
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,960
反正这儿的人只在乎赚钱
'Cause nobody around here gives a shit about anything

793
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,550
其他的事一概不想管
other than making money anyway.

794
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,730
迈克  发生什么了
Mike, what is going on?

795
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,970
事情是  我回来的唯一原因
What's going on is that the only reason I came back here

796
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,150
是哈维和我曾经有过约定
is that Harvey and I made a deal,

797
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,590
然而还不到一周
and it hasn't even been a week,

798
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,090
他就把这忘到脑后了
and he's already going back on it.

799
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,710
在我监管下不会发生这种事情的  好吗
That's not gonna happen on my watch. Okay?

800
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,100
所以冷静一下
So just slow down.

801
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,010
告诉我你说的到底是怎么回事
Tell me what the hell you're talking about.

802
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,780
哈维  我们需要谈谈
Harvey, we need to talk.

803
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,490
迈克刚刚告诉我  你打破了和他的约定
Mike just told me you're breaking a deal with him.

804
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,460
他不该跟你说这些的
Well, he shouldn't have told you that,

805
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,960
因为这不关你事
because that's none of your business.

806
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,710
不关我事
None of my business?

807
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,360
我的名字就写在墙上  和你的一样
My name's on the wall as much as yours.

808
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,240
听着  如果迈克不放弃诉讼的话
Look, if Mike doesn't drop that case,

809
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,360
我们就要失去一个大客户了
we lose a major client.

810
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,140
-那我接受不了  -不  哈维
- I can't have that. - No, Harvey.

811
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,710
我们接受不了的是你开创了个先例
What we can't have is you setting a precedent

812
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,430
让亚历克斯的客户骑在我们头上作威作福
that Alex's clients can run roughshod all over us.

813
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,570
你们小点声
Keep your voices down.

814
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,500
我明白了
Oh, I get it.

815
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,620
这不是关于我打破了和迈克的约定
So this isn't about me breaking my deal with Mike.

816
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,030
而是关于你嫉妒亚历克斯
This is about you being jealous of Alex.

817
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,480
不是  在我发现那是亚历克斯的客户之前
No, it isn't. I thought it was a mistake

818
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,850
我就觉得那是个错误
even before I found out that it was Alex's client.

819
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,310
-哈维  他说的有道理  -扯淡
- Harvey, he has a point. - Bullshit.

820
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,290
你跟我说过  你害怕我和他的关系
You told me you were afraid that I was gonna become

821
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,170
会比我们之间关系更好  就是这么回事
better friends with him than you, and that's what this is.

822
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,730
你竟敢在唐娜面前这样说
How dare you say that to me in front of Donna?

823
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,990
我可是私下告诉你这些的
I told you that in complete confidence.

824
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,970
这不是关于我和亚历克斯的关系
This isn't about my relationship with Alex.

825
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,540
而是关于你和他的关系
This is about your relationship with Alex

826
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,110
以及你不敢直面他
and how you're afraid to stand up to him.

827
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,570
你再跟我说一遍
You want to run that by me again?

828
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,210
我刚跟你说过一遍
I just ran it by you.

829
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,330
你犯了个错误
What you are doing is a mistake.

830
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,380
我不觉得
I don't think so,

831
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,370
唐娜也不觉得  所以说...
and Donna doesn't think so, which means--

832
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,130
实际上  哈维  我也觉得你犯错了
Actually, Harvey, I do.

833
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,770
而且如果你不介意的话  我有话可以自己说
And if it's all the same to you, I can speak for myself.

834
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,110
-你在开玩笑吗  -没有
- Are you kidding me? - No, I'm not.

835
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:58,110
因为上次你说过  如果我有什么事情要说
Because the last time you said if I had something to say,

836
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,510
就在会上说出来
say it in the goddamn meeting.

837
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,900
而这就是会上了
Well, this is the goddamn meeting.

838
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,000
我觉得应该对迈克信守诺言
And I happen to think we should keep our word to Mike

839
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,640
而不是任凭客户欺辱我们
instead of letting some client bully us.

840
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,980
感谢你的发言
Well, I appreciate the input.

841
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,930
但我说过  需要投票的时候
But I told you you'd get a vote

842
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,010
会有你的一票
when I said there'd be a vote,

843
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,490
而现在不需要投票
and this isn't a vote.

844
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,420
至于你  好好照照镜子吧
As for you, take a look in the mirror,

845
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,050
因为你生气的唯一原因是
because the only reason that you're pissed about this

846
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,470
你的新的好友  为了我取消了和你吃午餐
is your new honeysuckle friend canceled lunch on you for me.

847
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,420
路易
Louis...

848
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,750
你都这么大年纪了  怎么还把假期时间花在
Aren't you a little old to be spending your break

849
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,090
漫画店里
in a comic book store?

850
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,730
每个人都有爱好  迈克
Everybody has their hobbies, Mike.

851
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,010
我的爱好就是漫画
Mine's comics.

852
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,420
而你的爱好就是帮大公司
Yours is helping big corporations

853
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,720
挤兑弱势的一方
screw over the little guy.

854
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,140
等等  奥利佛
Oliver, wait.

855
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,660
我来这里只是想和你道歉
I just, I came here because I owe you an apology,

856
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,090
而这是我道歉的方式
and... this is my way of doing it.

857
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,970
这是什么
What's that?

858
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,510
多花点钱  好摆平事情吗
More money to make everything okay?

859
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,550
这是个案子  它对我来说很重要
It's a case. It's one that means a lot to me.

860
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,310
是关于死于狱中的一个人
It's about a guy who died in prison.

861
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,280
如果这对你那么重要  你干嘛不自己做
If it means so much to you, why don't you do it yourself?

862
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,180
我没法做
I can't.

863
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,310
我们和一个客户有冲突
We have a conflict with one of our clients.

864
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,950
说得很好  迈克  但我还是算了吧
Well, that's a nice speech, Mike, but I'm not interested,

865
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,750
因为还是有你的自身利益在里面  一向如此
because there's something in it for you, like always.

866
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,970
拜托  奥利佛  你拒绝之前
Oliver, please, look, before you say no,

867
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,720
起码听一下我要说的话
just listen to what I have to say.

868
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,230
我不需要再听你说什么了
I don't need to listen to you anymore.

869
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,530
他妈的  我差点死在里面了
God damn it, I almost died in there.

870
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,120
你说什么
What?

871
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,080
我在丹伯里监狱的第二个晚上
My second night in Danbury,

872
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,970
我想那人是来杀我的
I thought that someone was gonna kill me.

873
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,700
然后在我最后一晚
And then my last night,

874
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,990
我知道  同一个人又来了
I knew that same guy was coming for me again.

875
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,630
但我逃了出去
But I got out.

876
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,440
这个孩子没逃出去
This kid didn't.

877
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,310
我在这里唯一的自身利益
The only thing that's in this for me

878
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:54,070
就是确保这事不会发生在别人身上
is making sure that this doesn't happen to someone else.

879
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,350
这看起来像是早有预谋  迈克
This seems pretty cut-and-dry, Mike.

880
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,860
他们正希望如此
That's how they want it to look.

881
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,190
我已经知道了  他们那天晚上
I already know they didn't have enough guard staff

882
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,570
警卫人手不够
on duty that night.

883
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,350
所以  他们很可能
Which means they probably didn't have

884
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,300
医务人员也不够
enough medical staff either.

885
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,680
说不定根本没有
Or maybe none at all.

886
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,830
听着  我不能任由他们逃脱制裁
Look, I can't let them get away with this

887
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,200
我要把这案子交给那个
without handing it off to the one lawyer

888
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,280
在乎这件事并且能办成的律师
I know cares enough to see it through.

889
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,700
好  迈克
Okay, Mike.

890
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,770
我加入
I'm in.

891
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,120
-唐娜  无论如何  -瑞秋  我真的很抱歉
- Donna, whatever it is-- - Rachel, I'm so sorry.

892
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,660
我犯了个可怕的错误
What I did was wrong and horrible

893
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,790
对你毫无尊重
and showed you no respect,

894
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,770
而当你过来告知我这一点的时候
and then you came and tried to tell me that,

895
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,680
我的做法使它变得更糟了
and I made it a thousand times worse.

896
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,380
那你为什么要那样做
Why would you do something like that in the first place?

897
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,770
因为我也是个新手
'Cause I'm new at this.

898
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,300
我看见斯特芬妮对你那么糟
Then I saw Stephanie treating you like shit,

899
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,250
感觉就像是她在那样对我
and it felt like she was doing that to me.

900
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,310
因为是你给了我这份工作
Because you're the one that gave me the job.

901
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,440
或许吧
Maybe.

902
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,440
然后你说我在拖你的后腿
And then you told me I cut your legs out,

903
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,950
那让我觉得更糟了
and that made me feel even worse,

904
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,870
所以我就拿你泄愤
and I took it out on you.

905
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,010
-唐娜  -瑞秋  你是对的
- Donna-- - Rachel, you were right.

906
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,820
我还没完全准备好
I'm not completely ready for this.

907
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,000
我做的事情并不总是对的
And I'm not always gonna get things right,

908
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,550
而我今天就犯了个大错
and I got them really wrong today.

909
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,560
或许也不是全都错了
Maybe not all wrong.

910
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,680
什么意思
What do you mean?

911
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,040
我自己也想了一下
I thought about it too.

912
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,640
我终于进入律师协会了
I am finally a member of the bar.

913
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,560
我现在谁也不想管
I don't want to supervise anyone right now.

914
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,200
我只想尽自己所能当个好律师
I just want to be the best lawyer I can be.

915
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,090
我明白
I understand.

916
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,140
暂时由我来负责这些律师吧
I'll take care of the associates for now.

917
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,110
唐娜
Donna.

918
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,070
你是怎么想到这些的
What made you realize all that?

919
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,250
这么说吧
Let's just say

920
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,590
有人提醒了我
I was reminded what it feels like

921
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,580
别人代替你说话  而且说的
when someone speaks for you and what they're saying

922
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,510
并不是你想说的意思的感觉
is the complete opposite of what you wanted to say.

923
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,930
-路易吗  -哈维
- Louis? - Harvey.

924
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,370
给你这职位的人
The one who gave you your new position.

925
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,790
没错
Exactly.

926
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,750
我很遗憾  唐娜
I'm so sorry, Donna.

927
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,910
我也是  瑞秋
I'm sorry too, Rachel.

928
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,640
哈维  天很晚了  不管什么事...
Harvey, it's late. Whatever it is--

929
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,430
你是不是把这案子交给诊所了
Did you pawn that thing off to the clinic?

930
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,050
你让我放手  所以我就放手了
You asked me to drop it, so I dropped it.

931
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:25,830
胡扯
Bullshit.

932
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,150
你把它给了与你有关的诊所
You gave it to the clinic you're affiliated with.

933
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,080
是那个你跟我说允许我任意选择
The clinic you told me I could give cases to

934
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,020
案子给予的诊所
at my discretion.

935
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,650
也许是我没说清楚
Maybe you missed the memo.

936
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,890
如果我们的律所和本案扯上任何关系
If our firm is in any way associated with that case,

937
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,110
我们都会丢失一个大客户
we lose a huge client.

938
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,710
哈维  我已经不办这个案子了
Harvey, I'm not working on it.

939
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,750
那就出一份书面声明
Then you're gonna put that in writing,

940
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,760
而且要交给亚历克斯的客户
and you're gonna deliver it to Alex's client.

941
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,290
铁甲长城
Ironclad Chinese wall.

942
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,230
保证你与本案无关
You have nothing to do with this case.

943
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,430
你的意思是你不信任我吗
Are you saying you don't trust me?

944
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,600
你是在说你把案子交给诊所时
You saying you didn't know what you were doing

945
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,060
不知道这意味着什么吗
when you gave it to the clinic?

946
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,740
好吧  哈维
Okay, Harvey.

947
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,550
我出声明
I'll put it in writing.

948
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,020
我要你亲口给我保证
I want you word you're gonna live

949
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,450
你将遵守声明
by what you sign.

950
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,480
我保证
You have my word.

951
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,770
你找我
You wanted to see me?

952
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,580
是的  我想问问
Yes, I did, I was just wondering,

953
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,180
瑞秋给你的任务你完成了吗
have you redone the assignment that Rachel gave you?

954
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,330
还没有
Not yet.

955
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,140
我的事情一大堆
I had a ton on my plate.

956
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,170
本来打算明天做
I was gonna get to it tomorrow.

957
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,540
你被解雇了
You're fired.

958
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,750
求你  我真的打算做的
Please, I-I really was going to do it.

959
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,750
我相信你
I believe you.

960
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,340
但我的规矩是  三振出局
But my rule is three strikes and you're out.

961
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,710
否则错误总会没完没了
Otherwise, where does it end?

962
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,270
如果这样  为什么不当众宣布
In that case, why not do this publicly?

963
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,430
我不需要当众宣布  斯特芬妮
I don't need to do this publicly, Stephanie.

964
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,580
你明天不来上班了  大家自然明白
When you're not here tomorrow, people will know what happened.

965
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,080
但我想告诉你  我希望你未来会好
But I do want you to know, I wish you well.

966
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,090
你真指望我相信这种话吗
Do you expect me to believe that?

967
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,730
我不知道
I don't know.

968
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,120
但这话是真的
But it's true.

969
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,710
先别急着开口
Before you say anything,

970
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,250
我来是有原因的
I came here for a reason.

971
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,230
因为这里是我们初见的地方
Because this is where we met,

972
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,060
但现在我已经不属于这里
but it isn't where I need to be anymore.

973
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,270
哈维  我不是觉得...
Harvey, I don't think--

974
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,100
我只有一个问题问你
I just have one question to ask you.

975
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,790
你是在担心这个女人的想法
Are you worried about what this woman's gonna think

976
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,800
还是担心我们不合适
or because you think what we're doing is wrong?

977
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,900
因为如果只是担心别人的想法
Because if this is just about what other people think,

978
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,950
那是大错特错
it's crazy.

979
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,360
但我不这么认为
Well, it isn't crazy to me,

980
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,120
而且我需要你理解这一点
and I need you to understand that.

981
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,140
我理解
I do understand that,

982
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,140
但我也知道我们有感情
but I also know we have a connection,

983
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,330
就为了你毫无来由的幻想中的问题
and to throw that away

984
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,110
就把它抛弃...
because of some figment of your imagination--

985
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,800
这不是毫无来由的幻想
It is not a figment of my imagination.

986
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,780
而且我也不是担心她的想法
And I'm not worried about what she thinks.

987
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,500
我担心的是我的想法
I am worried about what I think. 

988
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,280
那你的想法是什么
And what is it that you think?

989
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,270
我在想这是不是一个大错误
That what if this was a terrible mistake

990
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,980
如果最后不成呢
and it doesn't work out

991
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,800
如果我在感情里像个傻子呢
and I look like a fool?

992
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,820
好吧
Okay.

993
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,990
我知道你才是心理医生
I know I'm not the therapist here,

994
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:02,040
但这难道不是每段恋爱都会有的担忧吗
but isn't that the risk of any relationship?

995
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,130
我害怕  哈维
I'm scared, Harvey.

996
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,880
我也是
Me too.

997
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,960
我们一起害怕好吗
What do you say we both be scared together?

998
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,160
有事吗
Can I help you?

999
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,920
有
Yeah.

1000
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,730
我叫迈克・罗斯
My name is Mike Ross.

1001
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,240
我很想说很高兴见到你
I would say nice to meet you,

1002
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,290
但我想你肯定不这么想
but I'm pretty sure you don't feel the same way.

1003
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,070
确实
Not particularly.

1004
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,530
这是什么
What's this?

1005
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,570
我接下来的十五个可能的案子
My next 15 potential lawsuits.

1006
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,240
我只是想确保你和这些案子
I just want to make sure you don't have any conflicts

1007
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,270
没有什么冲突
with any of these.

1008
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,550
也许你客户的奶奶
Maybe your client's grandmother

1009
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,950
在12号中提到的超市
shops at the supermarket

1010
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,870
购物过
across the street from number 12.

1011
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,960
我会看的
I'll take a look.

1012
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,060
很好  我想跟你说清楚
Good, 'cause just to be clear,

1013
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,200
如果我提前知道有冲突
if I'd known there was a conflict,

1014
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,880
我是不会接这个案子的
I never would've taken the case.

1015
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,090
谢谢你送来这个
I appreciate you dropping it.

1016
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,310
我是被迫送来这个的
I was bulldozed into dropping it,

1017
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,580
而且还被迫签了这个
just like I was bulldozed into signing this.

1018
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,540
这两件事我可以接受
Now, I can live with both those things,

1019
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,310
但我不希望再发生这种状况
but I never want to get caught in this situation again.

1020
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,810
笑什么
What's so funny?

1021
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,630
我刚跟我的客户说了同样的话
I just told my client the same damn thing.

1022
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,470
胡扯
Bullshit.

1023
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,610
你以为这件事就让我脸上有光吗
You think this makes me look good?

1024
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,640
那看来也许我们真的是一条船上的人
Well then I guess we're in the same boat after all.

1025
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,760
很高兴见到你  迈克
It's nice to meet you, Mike.

1026
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,070
皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特欢迎你
Welcome to Pearson Specter Litt.

1027
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,120
你说我需要面对这种事的策略
You said I needed a strategy for when it happened.

1028
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,710
我用了你的策略  放下了这件事
Well, I used your strategy, and I got over it,

1029
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,910
但一点问题都没解决
but it didn't fix a goddamn thing!

1030
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,510
路易  镇定  有我帮你
Louis, calm down. I'm here for you.

1031
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,940
你没有  你从来就没帮过我
No, you're not! You're never there for me.

1032
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,370
你永远都要跟我对着干
You're always against me.

1033
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,100
我按你的话做了
I did what you said,

1034
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,400
但这次  不是我的错
and this time, it's not my fault.

1035
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,510
我不管你是怎么想的
And I don't give a shit what you think.

1036
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,970
我不是你口中所谓的坏人
I'm not the horrible person you always say I am.

1037
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,790
路易  我不觉得你是坏人
Louis, I don't think you're a horrible person.

1038
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,970
我觉得你很好
I think you're a wonderful person.

1039
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,860
如果我没有让你认识到这一点
And if I haven't made that clear to you,

1040
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,360
