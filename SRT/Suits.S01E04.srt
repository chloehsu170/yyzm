他不知道

65
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,620
你为什么这么肯定
How can you be so sure about that?

66
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,210
因为你现在还跟我走在一起
Because you're walking with me right now.

他举办了这场哈佛知识问答
He did this whole harvard trivia thing,

68
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,950
又问到那个披萨
and then he brought up this pizza--

69
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,510
这也不能说明他知道
Doesn't mean he knows.

70
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,760
我觉着我们需要
Look, I think we need to hack

71
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,120
入侵哈佛系统
into Harvard's system or something.

72
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,760

只要你不惹祸
Listen, nobody's gonna check into your past

没人会翻你的老底

79
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,660
路易是不光明磊落  但他没那么大胆

80
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,400
他想不到我们会这么做
He won't think we did this.

81
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,750
因为他自己不会做这种事
Because he'd never think to do it himself.

82
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,540
多布隆金币吗
Doubloons?

83
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,400
你那荒谬的建议
The ridiculousness of your suggestion

84
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,060
害我说了个这么傻的词
warranted the use of a silly word.

85
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,850
明白
Got it.

86
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,360
刚刚走的是奎汀・桑兹吧
Was that Quentin Sainz I just saw leaving?

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,530
你认识他吗
Mm-hmm. You know him?

88
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,820
听说过
I know of him.

89
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,370
他为什么跟你握手  还吻你的手
Why was he holding your hands? Kissing them?

90
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,900
你想说什么  哈维
What are you implying, Hharvey?

91
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,970
不知道  也许你俩确定关系了
I don't know, maybe you two are going steady.

92
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,190
我是说  看起来像是
I was implying that it looked like

93
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,350
你接他的案子  他感激涕零
he was grateful to you for taking his case.

94
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,350
很好  事实也是如此
Good, 'cause that's exactly what it was.

95
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,410
这步棋不妥  赢了也许能大赚一笔
That's a bad move. We may make money

96
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,580
但是一旦输了...
billing out on their defense, but when we lose--

97
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,880
输的可能性很大  长远利益会受损
Which we will--it's gonna hurt us in the long run.

98
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,890
-你怎么知道我们会输  -职业直觉
- How do you know we'll lose? - Because it's my job to know.

99
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,250
他公司治疗肌萎缩性侧索硬化的灵药
And his company's A.L.S. Wonder drug

100
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,810
吃死人了
is killing people.

101
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,240
肌萎缩性侧索硬化是不治之症
A.L.S. is incurable.

102
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,860
吃那药的人本来终究也会死的
And everyone who is taking that drug is going to die anyway.

103
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,110
这就是你的辩护词吗
Hm. That's your defense?

104
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,600
加速病人的死亡  变成服务公众了吗
If he kills them a little faster, it's a public service?

105
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,720
我们的抗辩是指控不实
Our defense is those allegations are untrue.

106
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,670
他把这事传得沸沸扬扬的
He has taken this story all over town,

107
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,610
没有律所会接这个案子
and not a single firm thinks he has a case.

108
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,210
所以他来找我
Which is why he came to me.

109
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,080
他需要有人信任他
Because he wants someone who believes in him.

110
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,610
你为什么要相信他
And what is it exactly that makes you believe in him?

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,410
我们结婚那段日子
Well, I got to know his character pretty well

112
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,070
足以让我深知他的品行
during the time that we were married.

113
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,990
奎汀明天会来见你
Quentin is expecting you tomorrow.

第一季 第四集

122
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,120
-你昨晚忘带这个了  -我没忘
- You forgot this last night. - I didn't forget that.

123
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,920
我没打算接这个案子
I have no intention of taking this case.

124
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,500
但是我给你准备了这个
Though, I did get you this.

125
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,490
-什么  -结婚礼物
- What is it? - A wedding gift.

126
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,380
不好意思送晚了  
I'm sorry it's so late,

127
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,560
但是由于我都不知道你结婚了
but it's hard to be on time

128
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,430
想及时送礼  也很有难度
when I never knew you were married.

129
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,380
你在跟谁约会吗  哈维
Are you seeing anyone, Harvey?

130
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,020
你不想告诉我  我也不在意
You don't wanna tell me, and I don't really care.

131
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,680
因为你我都是
Because you and I share the same trait

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,610
注重保护隐私的人
of keeping our personal lives personal.

133
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,670
你结过婚了
You were married.

134
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,190
那还是你读哈佛时候的事  感情进展不顺
It happened when you were at Harvard, didn't work out.

135
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,810
我们都太专注于自己的事业了
We were too dedicated to our careers,

136
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,910
我想说的也就这些了
And that's all I'm going to say about it.

137
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,100
好吧  你是对的
Okay. You're right.

138
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,440
不关我事
It's none of my business.

139
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,330
-这个案子我还是不接  -为什么
- I'm still not taking this case. - Why is that?

140
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,180
因为有时候我会做出让客户不爽的事情
Because sometimes I do things that my clients don't like.

141
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,500
如果他们的前妻监视着我
And if their ex-wives are looking over my shoulders,

142
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,800
倒也没啥事
that's not really a problem.

143
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,290
但是如果他们的前妻是我的经营合伙人
But when their ex-wives are also my managing partner,

144
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,910
我就放不开手脚了
that hamstrings me.

145
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,330
如果想让我扳回官司
And if I'm gonna turn this loser into a winner,

146
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,720
我就不能被束缚  绝对不能
I can't be hamstrung. I can't have that.

147
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,110
你想怎么做都行
Do what you gotta do.

148
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,350
-你不会干预吗  -我刚才不是说了嘛
- You won't interfere? - What did I just say?

149
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,610
如果不是辉瑞  阿目金
Do you have any idea how hard it is

150
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,010
或者默克这类大制药公司
to develop a new drug

151
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,250
你知道普通公司要开发新药有多难吗
if you're not Pfizer, or Amgen, or Merck?

152
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,540
这事很重要  哈维
This is important, Harvey.

153
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,960
如果奎汀是来找一个信任他的人
If Quentin came to you looking for someone to trust him,

154
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,840
你为什么不接他的案子
why aren't you handling this case yourself?

155
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,190
与你无关
That's none of your concern.

156
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,390
我不是以同事的身份问你
Well, I'm not asking you that as your colleague,

157
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,410
而是以奎汀的律师身份问你
I'm asking you as Quentin's attorney.

158
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,200
我和奎汀分居以后
After Quentin and I separated,

159
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,340
他开始和一个研究顾问约会
he started seeing one of his research consultants.

160
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,110
她叫丽萨  他们现在还在一起
Lisa. They're still together.

161
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,810
但是他没娶她
But he never married her.

162
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,950
她不希望我插手这个案子
She doesn't want me on the case.

163
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,210
好极了
Oh, terrific.

164
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,680
你硬塞给我一个必输的案子
You're sticking me with a losing case,

165
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,980
还塞给我一个既不喜欢你
and a girlfriend who isn't gonna like me

166
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,520
也不会喜欢我的女朋友
anymore than she likes you.

167
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,850
我敢肯定这不是第一次
Well, I'm sure it's not the first time

168
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,180
有人不喜欢你了  哈维
someone hasn't liked you, Harvey.

169
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,800
谁不喜欢我了
Who doesn't like me?

170
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,660
他就像一个无恶不作的魔鬼
Picture the devil without the charm.

171
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,530
好吧  所以说这两年来楼主都是卡里斯基 
Okay, so Karinski owned this building for two years?

172
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,300
没错  随后情况就急转直下了
Yeah, then things got bad.

173
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,600
零下三度时供热断了  差点把我冻死
Three below, the heat went out and I nearly froze to death.

174
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,070
炉子又发生了煤气泄漏
Then a gas leak in my stove.

175
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,900
都能闻到那股味  可他却说没事
You could smell the damn thing, but he said it was fine.

176
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,110
我打了一个月的电话  最后还是自己换的
I called for a month, then I had to replace it myself.

177
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,180
为什么不干脆搬走
Why didn't you just move?

178
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,220
我是在这所公寓里长大的
This is the apartment that I grew up in.

179
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,610
这里是我唯一熟悉的地方
It's the only place I've ever known.

180
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,610
我没有兄弟姐妹
I don't have any brothers or sisters.

181
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,390
我的父母  也不在了
My parents... not with me anymore.

182
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,000
我不会离开我和他们仅有的维系之所
I'm not leaving the one connection I have to them.

183
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,460
你说你睡不着觉  是压力大还是
You said you weren't sleeping. Are you stressed out, or--?

184
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,990
-有臭虫  -不会吧
- Bedbugs. - No.

185
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,210
我的房间简直爬满了臭虫
My place is literally crawling with them.

186
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,530
想到自己一关灯  他们就会爬过来
Could you sleep knowing the minute you turn out the light,

187
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,430
-你还能睡着吗  -睡不着
- they're coming for you? - No, I couldn't.

188
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,530
拿不出证据  卡里斯基就不管
Well, Karinski won't do anything about it without proof,

189
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,090
可我找不来有关部门去证实
And I can't get someone from the city down

190
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,320
那里有臭虫
to verify they're there.

191
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,570
别担心  我可以
Don't worry. I can.

192
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,940
要等两周  下周四
Two weeks. Next Thursday.

193
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,910
我想你没听清我说什么
I-I-I-I don't think that you heard me.

194
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,280
我现在就要人过去
I need someone down there today.

195
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,410
-要等两周  下周四  -好了
- Two weeks, next thursday. - Okay.

196
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,580
我想跟你们的主管谈谈
Uh, I'd like to speak to your supervisor, please.

197
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,980
你可以下周三来
You can do that next Wednesday.

198
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,120
好吧  格兰达  我告诉你从现在起
Okay, Glenda, let me tell you what I'm gonna do

199
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,920
到下周三  我会怎么做
between now and next wednesday...

200
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,420
我很清楚你要怎么做
I know exactly what you're gonna do.

201
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,090
每个律师都会这么威胁我
You're gonna do what every lawyer threatens to do.

202
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,930
你会递交409/3投诉
You're gonna file a 409/3 grievance

203
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,800
说我没有格尽职守
Claiming that I did not fulfill my obligation

204
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,300
让你马上见到我的主管
to promptly direct you to my supervisor.

205
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,920
这份投诉将会在下周三递交给我的主管
A grievance that will be passed on to my supervisor next Wednesday.

206
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,760
不  我要做的是  雇一名私家侦探
No, what I'm gonna do is hire a private investigator

207
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,040
调查从你出生到下周二期间
to look into every aspect of your life

208
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,680
你生活的方方面面
from the day you were born until next Tuesday.

209
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,910
有任何发现  我都会加以利用
And then I'm gonna use whatever it is they find

210
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,820
让你整天祈祷  能保住这份
to make you wish that your biggest problem

211
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,480
你看来也厌恶十足的工作
was keeping this job that you seem to hate so much.

212
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,990
没错  我是个与众不同的律师  格兰达
Yeah, I'm not like every other lawyer, Glenda.

213
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,560
你刚才说你叫什么
What did you say your name was?

214
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,610
斯佩克特
Specter.

215
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,750
哈维・斯佩克特
Harvey Specter.

216
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
-你是棒球迷吗  -是啊
- You're a baseball fan? - Oh, yeah.

217
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,800
那你应该知道卢・格里格是个狠角色
Then I assume you know Lou Gehrig was a bad man.

218
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,940
不然也不会被人称作火车了
They didn't call him the iron horse for nothing.

219
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,780
后来他得了肌萎缩侧索硬化症  
Then he got A.L.S.

220
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,530
知道他怎样了吗
You know what it did to him?

221
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,110
他的手瘫痪了  之后是脚
His hands locked up, then his legs,

222
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,120
接着失语  最后窒息
His speech, eventually his breathing.

223
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,380
无法控制
Couldn't control 'em.

224
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,090
他的头脑很清楚  可是身体却
His mind knew what it wanted, but his body--

225
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,850
他完全被困住了  无法自理
He was trapped inside, unable to do anything.

226
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,920
就算今时今日  患上肌萎缩侧索硬化症
Even today, you get A.L.S.,

227
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,490
不出三五年也必死无疑
within three to five years, you die.

228
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,030
如果吃了你的药出现肝衰竭  会死得更快
Or sooner, if someone takes your drug and their liver fails.

229
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,860
我们的药能减轻最后几年的痛苦
Our drug makes people's remaining years better,

230
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,490
还能让他们的预期寿命翻倍
And it doubles their life expectancy.

231
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,170
除了那些出现肝脏衰竭的人
Except for the people who's livers are failing.

232
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,950
-你不...  -丽萨
- You don't - Lisa.

233
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,650
不要紧
It's okay.

234
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,670
我知道杰西卡为什么喜欢你了  
I can see why Jessica likes you.

235
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,420
你说话直来直往
You cut through the bullshit.

236
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,980
我就喜欢她这点
That's something I always loved about her.

237
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,110
只是她这么说话的魅力  会比我少一点
She just does it with a little less charm than I do.

238
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,680
她是不是比你高一点
Isn't she a little taller than you?

239
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,370
-她穿高跟鞋了  -我来告诉你
- It's the heels. - Let me tell you

240
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,390
一种药物通过审批都需要什么
what it takes to get a drug approved today.

241
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,560
药物上架之前  我们投入了
We were $139 million into development

242
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,470
一亿三千九百万用于研发
before we ever hit the shelves.

243
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,930
所有的要求我们都一一通过了
We jumped through every hoop they threw at us,

244
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,130
花了八年时间证明我们的药是安全的
And we proved our drug was safe for eight years.

245
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,730
所以你说这些控告是毫无根据的
So you're saying these claims are baseless?

246
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,930
在这六个晚期病人身上
We're talking about six terminal patients

247
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,900
存在一系列的医疗问题
with a wide array of medical issues.

248
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,790
凭什么说是我们公司的药物导致的
And they're saying my company's drug caused this?

249
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,730
莱昂纳多・迪卡普里奥落水的原因
They were drinking coffee on the Titanic.

250
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,380
也不会是当时人们都在泰坦尼克号上喝咖啡吧
I don't think that put Leonardo Dicaprio in the water.

251
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,910
既然杰西卡向我担保了
Since Jessica vouched for you,

252
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,150
我就会相信你说的话
I'm gonna go ahead and believe what you're telling me.

253
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,780
但鉴于其他药品公司已决定要让你曝光
But since these other firms determined you have exposure,

254
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,880
我们就得这么办  赔他们钱
Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna pay them.

255
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,320
赔他们一点点钱
We're gonna pay them a little bit of money

256
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,080
你就可以继续救死扶伤  
So you can keep saving lives,

257
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,360
因为如果这事拖久了
because if we drag this out,

258
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,000
人们就不会相信你的药能救命了
people won't think of your drug as a way to save lives,

259
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,930
他们会觉得你的药能致命
They'll think of it as a death sentence.

260
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,130
房屋管理处的人
The guy from the housing department's

261
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,630
五分钟之后就到
gonna be here in about five minutes.

262
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,160
你是怎么办到的
How did you manage that?

263
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,740
如果把情况跟他们说清楚
You know, they're actually pretty receptive

264
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,990
他们还是会听进去的
when you explain the situation to them.

265
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,240
为了防止虫害蔓延  只能这么做
That's what you have to do to prevent the spread.

266
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,080
我都忍痛扔了很多东西了
I had to get rid of most of my things--

267
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,310
衣服  收藏的唱片  书
Clothes, record collection, books.

268
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,110
我当初还有第一版的《麦田守望者》呢
I had a first edition "Catcher in the Rye",

269
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,580
-你知道有多值钱吗  -不知道
- You know what that was worth? - No.

270
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,720
那些虫子能潜伏十八个月
The bugs can live dormant for 18 months.

271
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,760
你得把所有东西都扔了
You just have to throw everything out.

272
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,960
-弗兰克  -卡里斯基
- Frank! - Karinski.

273
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,430
-你在这啊  -是啊
- You're here. - yes.

274
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,260
-我住这  -你还有脸说
- I live here. - Funny you should mention that,

275
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,930
你都四个月没交房租了
'cause you haven't paid rent in four months,

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,970
-我真不确定了  -我没交房租
- So I wasn't sure. - I haven't paid rent

277
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,150
是因为你没有...  
because you haven't--

278
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,900
弗兰克不交房租
Frank has withheld rent

279
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,200
是因为这公寓住不了人
because the apartment is not habitable.

280
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,910
纽约住房规定  副二章  第四条
New York housing code, sub-chapter two, article four

281
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,340
-第27至20节  -不交房租就走人
- Section 27-20-- - Hey, no rent, no apartment.

282
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,880
这是我的规矩
That's my code.

283
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,700
你想依法办事是吧
But if you want something legal...

284
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,480
这是法院的命令  三天之内给我滚出去
There's a court order. You got three days to get out.

285
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,140
不然治安部的人也会来替你搬家的
Or the sheriff's department will empty the place for you.

286
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,390
祝你愉快
Have a nice day.

287
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,730
你迟到了
You're late.

288
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,240
是因为路易的无偿案件  我
Look, it was Louis' pro bono, I--

289
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,970
这是我的西装  我办公室那套备用的
Hey, that's my suit. My extra suit from my office.

290
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,840
是的  都怪路易  那个当事人的房间
Yeah, it's Louis' fault. I went to the client's place,

291
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,680
到处都是臭虫  所以当我回到办公室
It was overrun with bedbugs, so I went back to the office--

292
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,250
你把臭虫带到我的办公室了
You tracked bedbugs into my office?

293
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,210
-没有  -那你裸体进去的
- No. - You walked in there naked?

294
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,650
不是  是唐娜给我送到楼下男厕的
No, Donna met me in the downstairs men's room...

295
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,710
够了  唐娜被解雇了  你得给我买套新的
Okay, Donna's fired, and you're buying me an extra suit.

296
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,450
还有  这是三件套的
By the way, that's a three-piece suit.

297
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,180
马甲呢
Where's the vest?

298
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,490
没错  我正想跟你说这事呢
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

299
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,950
马甲  还要穿马甲吗
Vests? Really?

300
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,520
戴着自行车头盔的人懂什么
Says the guy with the bike helmet.

301
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,400
安全第一嘛
Uh, safety first.

302
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,730
慢点
Come on.

303
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,940
这就是生产艾米林克斯药的大楼啊
Ah, the house that Amylinx built.

304
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,440
不错  真不错
Nice. Very nice.

305
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,400
我叫科林・ 彻奇  桑兹先生  
Collin Church, Mr. Sainz

306
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,980
还有斯佩克特先生
and Mr. Specter,

307
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,170
您姗姗来迟  为解决我们这小小的法律纠纷  
lately arrived to our little legal dispute.

308
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,440
法律纠纷吗  我看是勒索
You say legal dispute, I say shakedown.

309
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,420
这二者的差别总是很微妙  不是吗
Always a fine line between the two, n'est pas?

310
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,030
说实话  如果我们坐在这
Look, we can sit here and posture

311
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,130
讨论各自在案件中的优势和劣势
about the strengths and weaknesses of our cases,

312
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,550
那对我来说真是无聊透顶了
but frankly, that's gonna bore the hell out of me.

313
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,930
真的吗
Seriously?

314
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,620
-还可以更少的  -我说会更多
- It could be much lower. - It could be much higher.

315
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,370
那就当它正好吧
Then let's pretend it's just right.

316
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,740
我的委托人寿命缩短了
My client's lives are being cut short.

317
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,650
而且根据公式计算
And according to accepted calculations,

318
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,820
现在一条命可值790万
the current value of a life is $7.9 million.

319
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,850
你这连零头都不够
You're not even offering pennies on that.

320
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,990
那些公式是环保局
Those happen to be E.P.A. Calculations

321
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,060
根据完整的平均寿命计算的
based on a full life expectancy.

322
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,560
考虑到原告的寿命
Adjusted for plaintiffs

323
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,260
本来就时日不多了
Who's expectancy is just a fragment of this,

324
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,050
也就只值143427美元
yields a value of $143,427.

325
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,960
估算值
Approximately.

326
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,110
你们这位小朋友没明白
What your child fails to understand is that

327
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,170
对于一个只剩下三至五年寿命的人
For someone with only three to five years to live,

328
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,340
每一天都是无比珍贵的
Each day is worth infinitely more.

329
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,610
关键在于惩罚性损害赔偿的问题
But the real crux is the punitive damages.

330
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,080
如果你的当事人想让我相信
Because if your client wants to sell me the idea

331
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,160
这些年来他对药的副作用一无所知
that he didn't know about these side effects years ago.

332
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,660
我是不会相信的
I'm not buying it.

333
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,130
所以我们要求赔偿2.5亿
Which is why we want $250 million.

334
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,630
-什么  -奎汀
- What? - Quentin.

335
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,040
不可能  这太不讲道理了
No, man. This is outrageous.

336
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,430
你知道自己在干嘛吗
Do you know what you're doing?

337
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,000
你是在让我的公司破产
You're bankrupting this company

338
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,070
还缩短了那些服用我公司药物的人们
and taking away years of life from real people

339
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,340
得以轻松行走  交谈
who are walking, talking, and breathing easier

340
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,280
和呼吸的年限
because of the drug we make.

341
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,220
我并不代表这些人
I don't represent those people.

342
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,370
我的当事人...  
My clients--

343
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,610
要求巨额索赔的可能性极低
Have tenuous claims at best.

344
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,310
除非你们六个人中有
And unless one of your six is

345
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,710
鲁伯特・默多克[新闻集团总裁]
Rupert Murdoch.

346
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,270
不然你想都别想
You're out of your mind.

347
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,910
好吧
Okay.

348
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,910
紧急警告  桑兹药厂艾米林克斯药物服用者

349
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,530
-你登报了  -还没  但我会的
- You printed that? - Well, not yet. But I will.

350
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,940
你知道这算诽谤吧
You realize that's libelous.

351
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,000
也许是  也许不是
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

352
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,230
不过一旦刊登出来后  你我都清楚
But after it runs, you and I both know,

353
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,650
诽不诽谤就不重要了
It won't much matter.

354
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,370
没什么好说的了  我不接受勒索 
We're done here. I don't take to extortion.

355
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,300
无论西装有多赞  我也不会
I'm not gonna be bullied by an ambulance-chaser

356
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,760
被专接事故案的无名小卒恐吓  
no matter how nice his suit.

357
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,140
这西服确实很赞  不是吗
It is nice, isn't it?

358
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,860
意大利制造  相当合身 
Italian. And it fits.

359
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,150
两亿五  桑兹先生
$250 million, Mr. Sainz.

360
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,140
我给你们四天时间
I'll give you four days.

361
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,180
彻奇想玩下去  我们就奉陪到底
Church wants to play, we play.

362
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,190
我早上还有个房屋案子要开庭
I have housing court in the morning.

363
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,730
只是个房屋案件  你奶奶都能打赢
It's housing court. Your grandmother could win.

364
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,520
我们先查一下他当事人的
Let's see just how real

365
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,360
肝脏到底出了什么问题
his clients' liver problems are.

366
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,300
如果事情属实  我们就说那是由于
Are if they are real, we suggest they're from

367
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,100
疾病本身  或用药不慎
the disease itself, or they took the wrong dose,

368
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,880
或者他们在鸡尾酒里加了混合药物
or they took a cocktail of combined drugs.

369
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,670
还有  我要看一下奎汀公司的财务状况
Also, I wanna see Quentin's company financials.

370
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,870
我已经跟他们说过了
I already asked for them once.

371
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,610
打个电话给他们  随时跟进
I want you to call them and follow-up.

372
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,710
我要知道彻奇可能查到的任何资料
I wanna know everything church could go after.

373
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,460
我们不在这儿想谈和方案 
So we've gone from settlement

374
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,630
而要采取极端措施了
to scorched earth.

375
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,370
我不想开一张两亿五的支票给他
I didn't feel like writing a $1/4 billion check.

376
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,020
-现在还只是谈判而已  -没错
- It's a negotiation. - Exactly.

377
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,020
所以我才要为下一轮充分武装
That's why I'm arming myself for the next round.

378
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,850
靠查奎汀的老底吗
By digging into Quentin?

379
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,380
我可是童子军
I'm a boy scout.

380
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,150
我不打无准备之仗
I like to be prepared.

381
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,970
你是说你会像童子军那样
So you think you'll look like a boy scout

382
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,730
让那些奄奄一息的病人出庭作证
By putting dying people on the stand

383
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,020
再让他们败诉
and tearing them apart?

384
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,970
那你就是个混蛋
You're gonna look like an asshole.

385
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,070
虽然他们每个人都声称有副作用
For every one they claim has a side effect,

386
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,040
但我们这儿有600人没发现副作用
We have 600 who don't.

387
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,880
如果让别人以为我是混蛋
And if I need to look like an asshole

388
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,010
就能向陪审团说明
to convince the jury

389
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,360
几百个人的命远重于一个人的命
that hundreds are more important than the one,

390
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,160
我也不用担心的睡不着了
I'm not gonna lose a minute's sleep over it.

391
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,290
我明早还有个房屋案件要开庭
Well, I have court in the morning.

392
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,320
我不明白
Oh, I'm-- I'm not clear.

393
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,750
我是在和我的经营合伙人说话
Was this a conversation with my managing partner

394
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,290
还是在和我客户的前妻说话
or my client's ex-wife?

395
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,560
你得妥善处理这件案子  哈维
You need to settle this case, Harvey.

396
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,740
我会的  只要你不插手
Which I will do if you stay out of it...

397
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,050
就像你之前保证的
As you promised.

398
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,040
好好处理
Make it go away.

399
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,640
-瑞秋  -走开
- Rachel. - Go away.

400
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,980
我要跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

401
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,290
谁又找你茬了  迈克 
Who's picking on you now, Mikey?

402
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,450
老爸老妈吵架咯
Mom and Dad are fighting.

403
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,740
-哈维和杰西卡  -你担心个什么劲啊
-Harvey and Jessica. - What do you care?

404
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,380
我只是有点担心
Oh, I'm just rattled.

405
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,180
明天是我第一次出庭  房屋案件
My first trial tomorrow in housing court.

406
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,740
房屋的案子吗
Housing court?

407
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,360
我都能打赢这官司  你能行的
I could win at housing court. You'll be fine.

408
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,610
但要是穿这件衬衫就另当别论了
But not if you wear that suit.

409
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,000
卡维罗与卡里斯基房租纠纷诉讼案
Carvello versus Karinski properties.

410
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,770
通常这类案件是怎么审的
So how does this usually work?

411
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,650
通常在审讯开始
Well, usually the trial starts,

412
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,740
法官会坐在那  然后  
and there's the judge, and then...you know,

413
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,440
大家就开始辩护
people say things.

414
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,050
你以前从来没接过案子吧
You've never done this before, have you?

415
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,290
第一次开车之前
Well, I never drove a car before

416
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,310
我也没开过车啊  
the first time I drove one,

417
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,790
但是我现在不是也安然无恙吗
and I'm still here, aren't I?

418
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,160
这是你第一次上庭吗
This is your first time?

419
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,200
我是你的第一个对手
I'm your first?

420
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,190
别担心  我保证不会手下留情的
Don't worry, I promise not to be gentle.

421
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,010
弗兰克  见到你真高兴
Frank. It's nice to see you.

422
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,670
最后一次了
One last time.

423
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,470
请允许我...
If it pleases the court--

424
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,230
请允许我宣布何人何时开始陈词
It pleases the court to decide who speaks and when.

425
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,980
我还是坐下吧
I'll sit down.

426
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,450
今天的案子是关于四千元的房租拖欠
We're talking about $4,000 in withheld rent pas--

427
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,480
是的  法官大人  但是我们有  
Yes, your honor. But we have receipts

428
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,640
维修  失窃衣物的收据  还有...
for repairs, lost clothing, as well as...

429
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,510
四千元  没错  法官大人
$4,000. Yes, your honor.

430
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,050
她是在和我说话
She was talking to me.

431
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,890
他为什么没付房租  对方律师
Why hasn't he paid, counselor?

432
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,000
法官是在问你呢
That one was for you.

433
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,600
是因为臭虫  法官大人
Bedbugs, your honor.

434
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,170
我掌握的收据资料显示
I have receipts that show

435
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,130
我的当事人若要解决这些问题
my client's financial outlay

436
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,790
所需的财力远远超过他的实际收入水平
to rectify the problem far exceeds the amount.

437
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,070
房屋管理部门确认了臭虫的情况属实了吗
Housing department certified the presence of bedbugs?

438
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,120
-是的  法官大人  -房租减免呢
- Uh, yes, your honor. - Abatement?

439
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,050
借过
Excuse me.

440
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,300
我来吧  给
I'll do it. There you go.

441
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,390
法官大人  这是房屋收回听证会  
Your honor, this is an eviction hearing.

442
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,590
重点不在于房屋是否适合居住
The pertinent question is not habitability,

443
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,220
而在于对方是否已付房租
but whether or not rent has been paid.

444
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,250
实际上  城市法规明确规定
Actually, city code states that

445
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,930
不能保证房屋的适居度
rent may be withheld

446
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,830
可以不支付房租
if the warranty of habitability is breached.

447
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,510
那样的话  我要求查看第三方对 
In that case, we request to see the checks

448
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,200
罗斯先生当事人的担保核对
Mr. Ross' client has placed in escrow.

449
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,570
核对  第三方的...
Checks, in escrow.

450
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,600
房租减免与否取决于此
Pending the outcome of a rent abatement hearing?

451
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,060
法规里可没这么规定  
That's not in the code.

452
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,750
这是不成文的规矩
It is the accepted practice.

453
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,600
因此在这个法庭上是适用的
And therefore binding in this courtroom.

454
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,660
我想你的当事人
Your client did

455
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,330
应该出钱进行过第三方担保吧
put money in escrow, I assume.

456
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,390
-我没有多余的钱了啊  -法官大人
- I didn't have any money left-- - Your honor...

457
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,300
赞成收回房屋
Eviction upheld.

458
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,880
但是法官大人  他...  
But your honor, he--

459
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,830
看到我敲木槌了吗
Did you see me bang the gavel?

460
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,530
那意味着判决已定  下一个案子
That means step aside. Next case.

461
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,710
你永远不会忘记你的第一次的
You never forget your first.

462
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,840
你知不知道如果一个新棒球投手
You know what happens to pitchers

463
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,480
首场比赛失利会有什么下场吗  迈克
when they get shelled in rookie league, Mike?

464
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,240
你觉得他们还会成为种子选手吗
You think they make it to the bigs?

465
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,650
或许他们会去参军
Or do they just end up

466
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,850
最后惨遭遗忘
on some sad American legion team of has-beens?

467
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,550
我明白  我输了  我很抱歉
I get it, I lost. I'm sorry.

468
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,210
你很抱歉
Well, you're sorry.

469
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,890
-那样的话  -不  我真的很抱歉
- In that case-- - No, I am sorry.

470
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,950
但现在我要帮哈维查些资料
But right now I have some research to do for Harvey,

471
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,100
-所以失陪一下  -还记得你偷走了
- So if you'll excuse me. - Remember when you stole

472
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,590
我让你谈下来的那个客户吗
that client I had you bring in?

473
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,460
那时你真是风光啊  不是吗
That was a good time for you, wasn't it?

474
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,730
我给了你一个无足轻重的案子  
See, I gave you a nothing case so that

475
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,500
即使你打赢了
when you did win

476
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,460
那对你的事业也起不了什么作用
it would still do nothing for your career.

477
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,250
但我还是期望你能打赢
But I still expected you to win.

478
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,450
所以  我想  
So yeah, I guess...

479
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,330
你还是继续查你的资料吧
Go back to your research.

480
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,810
也许你就只能干这个
Maybe that is your niche.

481
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,080
也许吧
Maybe it is.

482
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,100
大多数清晨  我都不用坐在轮椅上
Most mornings, I can make it out of the chair

483
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,990
可以在地板上走动
and get across the floor.

484
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,350
还能抱起我女儿
And I can hold my daughter.

485
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,190
参与调查的有多少人
How many were in the study?

486
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,880
两年多里  有412人
412, over 2 years.

487
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,610
他们的所有录像资料我们都有
And we have videos of all of them.

488
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,480
25%的人服用的是安慰剂
25% were given placebos.

489
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,080
其余人都服用了不等剂量的艾米林克斯 
The rest, varying doses of Amylinx.

490
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,080
超过半数的人  都像这位患者一样
And more than half are like that one,

491
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,850
病情好转地相当快
showing significant signs of improvement.

492
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,710
你的意思是治疗一点都不会损害肝脏
And you're telling me there was nothing affecting the liver?

493
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,930
是的
Yes.

494
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,460
如果你来是为了质问我这个的  
If you're just coming to question that,

495
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,680
那可以直接跳过了
we'll move on.

496
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,560
你讨厌奎汀去找他前妻帮忙  对吗
You don't like it that Quentin went to his ex-wife, do you?

497
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,500
没错
No, I don't.

498
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,740
我不想他过去的包袱阻碍他的前途
I don't want any garbage from the past getting in the way.

499
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,310
奎汀在这里做出的成就  堪比奇迹
I mean, what Quentin's done here is nothing short of miraculous.

500
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,140
我想我可能找到了一个挽救奇迹的办法
I think I may have found a way to keep that miracle going.

501
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,140
我在翻看原告的医疗档案
I was going through the plaintiff's medical files,

502
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,310
我发现了这个
and then I found this.

503
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,670
好啊
This is good.

504
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,920
这真太好了
This is really good.

505
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,320
琼斯告诺克一案
Jones versus Norco...

506
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,820
沃什本告霍斯尼股份有限公司一案
Washburn versus Hawthorne Incorporated...

507
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,330
事实上  有七起案件
actually, seven cases that Mr. Church solicited

508
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,100
彻奇先生都是作为原告律师控告制药公司
lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies.

509
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,800
在每起案件中  他都能达成庭外和解
In each case, he was able to exact a settlement

510
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,070
因为这些公司知道  即使他们赢了官司
because the company knew that even if they won,

511
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,310
这样的拉锯战也会造成比和解更大的损失
a protracted battle would do more damage than settling.

512
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,710
你这说法有证据吗
You have evidence of that?

513
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,110
我们案件中的二号原告  埃莉诺・贝克
Plaintiff number two in our case, Eleanor Baker.

514
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,710
她同时还是
She also happens to be

515
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,310
琼斯告诺克一案的七号原告
plaintiff number seven in Jones versus Norco.

516
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,880
他这是回收再利用他的原告  挺环保的
He's recycling plaintiffs. That's very green of you.

517
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,550
彻奇先生你怎么说
Mr. Church?

518
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,820
斯佩克特先生有力证  我这儿也有
Mr. Specter has his documents, I have mine

519
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,520
这些文件显示了  药管局批准药品生产前
showing that prior to FDA approval of his drug,

520
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,890
奎汀・桑兹的公司濒临破产
Quentin Sainz's company was on the verge of bankruptcy.

521
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,060
药品上市后三个月
Three months after that drug hit the market,

522
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,470
销售额冲到一季度3800万美元
sales rocketed to $38 million a quarter,

523
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,900
这显然是伪造临床试验
which is clear financial motive

524
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,670
的财务动机啊
for falsifying clinical trials.

525
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,640
法官大人  这听起来
Now, Your Honor, does that sound like

526
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,610
也不是妄加推断吧
a groundless claim to you?

527
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,310
我让你去查他们的财务状况的
I told you to go over those financials.

528
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,650
我跟他要了五次了  他根本没给我
I asked him five times, he never gave them to me.

529
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,080
-法官大人  -斯佩克特先生
- Your Honor. - Mr. Specter,

530
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,590
你可以在庭审的时候质问他的辩护手法
you can question his tactics all you like at trial,

531
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,540
但他说的对
but he's right.

532
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,480
确实存在欺瞒作弊的财务动机
That right there is financial motive for fraud

533
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,880
本案进入下一阶段
this case is moving forward.

534
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,860
谢谢  法官大人
Thank you, Your Honor.

535
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,040
杰西卡  你来这儿干嘛
Jessica, what're you doing here?

536
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,930
进来
Get in.

537
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,540
我正要去买杯咖啡呢
I was just about to get some coffee.

538
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,760
我听说了你在法庭上受挫的事
Heard about your little setback in court.

539
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,490
因为我的客户隐瞒不报而遭偷袭
Getting blind-sided by my own client holding back

540
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,210
不叫受挫  叫受辱
isn't a setback, it's an embarrassment.

541
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,780
-你说什么呢  -你有没有想过
- What are you talking about? - Did you ever think

542
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,700
现在该认识到  或许他不是你想的那种
it's time to consider that he isn't the upstanding man

543
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,940
正直的人
that you think he is?

544
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,490
我们还是夫妻的时候
When we were married...

545
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,560
当奎汀知道我接的客户是有罪的时候
when I took a client Quentin knew was guilty,

546
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,780
他就唠叨个不停
he never shut up about it.

547
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,360
他会一直说要黑白分明
He went on, and on, about right and wrong.

548
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,960
听上去像个自以为是的讨厌鬼
Sounds annoyingly self-righteous.

549
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:13,960
确实
It was.

550
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,430
但这也是我知道他不会这么做的原因
But it's also how I know he didn't do this.

551
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,890
不管他犯了什么错  奎汀从没对我撒谎
For all his faults, Quentin has never lied to me before.

552
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,620
他也没对此事撒谎
And he's not lying about this.

553
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,080
所以别再质疑他的人品  想法赢得案子
So stop questioning his ethics and start winning this case.

554
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,080
我们说好你不会插手的
We had a deal that you were gonna stay out of it.

555
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,060
我掌握的情况  你并不都清楚
You don't know everything I know.

556
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,530
-那就给我看看  -这还叫不插手吗
- All right. - That's not staying out of it.

557
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,680
你说得对
No, you're right.

558
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,830
我现在要插手了
I'm not staying out of it anymore.

559
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,720
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

560
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,640
你们查他底细查得这么彻底
You looked into his background this deeply?

561
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,880
调查结果就是调查结果
The investigation reveals what it reveals.

562
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,280
如果他对此撒谎  对别的事也会撒谎
If he lied about this, he could've lied about anything.

563
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,500
你以为我不知道
You think I didn't know

564
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,810
他跟我分手之前就跟丽萨有一腿了吗
He started with Lisa before we were separated?

565
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,810
这我早知道了  哈维  我早不计较了
This is old news, Harvey. I moved on a long time ago.

566
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,270
杰西卡  这是他行为模式
Jessica, it's a pattern of behavior.

567
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,850
奎汀来找我  是因为他知道
Quentin came to me because he knew

568
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,260
我认为他是个好人  我还是这样认为的
I thought he was a good man, and I still do.

569
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,760
你显然不这么认为
You obviously don't.

570
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,920
我要接手这件案子
I'm taking the case.

571
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,050
那丽萨那儿怎么办
What about Lisa?

572
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,210
要是丽萨对此有意见
If Lisa has a problem with it,

573
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,290
让她来找我好了
then Lisa can take it up with me.

574
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,920
挺讽刺的是不是
It's kind of ironic, isn't it?

575
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,900
我们昨天都在法庭上败下阵来
You and I both lost in court yesterday.

576
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,870
你输了  房屋纠纷吗
You lost... in housing court?

577
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,080
你怎么能输掉房屋纠纷呢
How does one lose in housing court?

578
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,570
那种案子不请律师都能赢啊
People win there without lawyers.

579
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,470
对方有律师  叫塔纳卡  她还
Well, he had a lawyer, Tanaka, and she--

580
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,720
-薇薇安・塔纳卡吗  -对  你认识她吗
- Vivien Tanaka? - Yeah, what, you know her?

581
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,410
要是你的房东雇了薇薇安・塔纳卡
If your landlord's using Vivien Tanaka,

582
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,120
那这就不是臭虫的问题了
this isn't about bedbugs.

583
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,240
薇薇安・塔纳卡替曼哈顿一半的大厦打官司
Vivien Tanaka represents half the high-rises in Manhattan.

584
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,180
这不是什么房租纠纷  房东要盖公寓大厦
This isn't a petty rent dispute. Your guy's going condo.

585
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,430
那好啊
Well, that's great.

586
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,470
为了改造  逼迫弗兰克搬家构成骚扰罪
Forcing Frank out for conversion is harassment,

587
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,700
我能用这个告他
I can go after him for that.

588
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,380
不  你想打倒薇薇安
No, you wanna take down Vivien,

589
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,740
你最好多带上几个客户
you better go in there with more than just one client.

590
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,730
指出事件的普遍性  调解费就上去了
You show the pattern, the settlement goes up.

591
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,090
如果他们真对他这么干
If they did this to him,

592
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,870
我敢保证他们还对别人这么干过
I guarantee they've done this to others.

593
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,810
那我应该去找弗兰克楼里的其他人了
So I should find other people in Frank's building?

594
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,100
大胆设想
Think bigger.

595
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,680
怎么个大法
Bigger how?

596
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,900
卡里斯基拥有五栋楼
Karinski owns five buildings

597
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,630
之前都是租金管制公寓
and they all used to be rent-controlled,

598
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,630
为保护低收入者有屋可住实施的房屋管制政策

599
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,840
但现在都是一个单元150万
but now they go for a million and a half a unit.

600
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,990
利润可观啊
Nice profit margin.

601
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,920
我去房屋管理处
I went to look for housing department complaints

602
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,650
找他改造前一年的公寓投诉
in the year prior to his remodel.

603
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,250
每一栋楼里  掏不起改造后房租的住户
In each one of them, tenants who couldn't buy into the conversion

604
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,650
后来都对垃圾  采暖或臭气提起过投诉
ended up with some complaint-- garbage, heat, air.

605
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,290
所有人  一个一个的都被卡里斯基赶出去了
All of them, one by one, Karinski drove them out.

606
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,910
你在投诉上查不到他们的名字吗
You couldn't get their names from housing complaints?

607
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,170
查到了  我拿到一些名字
No, it gave me some names.

608
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,730
但我需要让此事看起来比他的大楼更严重
But I need to make this bigger than just his building.

609
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,580
我只有一小时午休时间
Look, I only get one hour off a day for lunch,

610
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,700
现在还没休上呢  你真需要我帮你吗
and I never take it. Do you really need me for this?

611
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,420
看见这对离开大厦的人了吗
See these people who are leaving the building?

612
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,850
整栋楼都是这样的人
The entire building looks like them.

613
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,310
我知道我还算干净利落  但是
I know I clean up okay, but...

614
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,620
你要我让你提升点档次
Mm, you need me to class you up a bit.

615
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,130
-不是档次的事  -就是档次的事
- Not class, but-- - Class.

616
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,940
好吧  只有能进门就行
All right, whatever gets you through the door.

617
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,830
-走吧  准备好了吗  -好了
- Come on, are you ready? - Yeah.

618
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,810
你好  我夫人和我
Hi, there. My wife and I

619
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,400
想来看看一些新单元
are here to see some of the new units.

620
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,690
是不是啊  亲爱的
Isn't that right, honey?

621
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,410
你觉得怎么样啊  甜心
So what do you think, sweetheart?

622
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,010
嗯  还好
Hm, it's fine.

623
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,020
但我觉得52街的那间更好一些
But I like the place on 52nd better.

624
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,610
52街  离你母亲家很近啊
52nd, that's awful close to your mother.

625
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,610
不不不  我们不谈我妈的事
No, no, no, we're not talking about my mother.

626
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,030
我倒是没关系啊
Well, I...look, it doesn't matter to me,

627
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,130
我喜欢住得离你妈近一些
I mean, I love being near your mother.

628
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,240
我很爱你母亲
I love your mother.

629
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,570
你何不跟我们介绍一下
So why don't you tell us

630
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,090
这栋大厦的情况
something about your little building?

631
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,160
我想你们会发现
Well, I think you'll find that

632
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,060
不仅我们的设施是一流的
not only are the amenities top quality,

633
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,980
-住户也是高素质人群  -那太好了
- so are the tenants. - That's good to hear.

634
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,220
是啊  因为我们不只是
Yeah, 'cause we're not just looking at

635
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,410
要买块地方  更是要在这儿安家的
buying square footage, but really put down some roots.

636
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,330
这里正是安家的明智选择
Well, that is such the right way to look at it.

637
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,110
是嘛
Is it?

638
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,380
是啊  你们还会发现
Yes, and I think you'll also find

639
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,200
入住的住户  他们跟你们很像
that the people who've bought here, they're like you.

640
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,890
年轻  上进
They're young, ambitious--

641
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,830
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

642
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,480
有什么疑问我能回答的吗
Any other questions I can answer?

643
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,360
对不起  我老婆  我美丽的老婆
I'm sorry. My wife here--my beautiful wife

644
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,180
有的时候会有点多疑  你懂吗
is just--gets a little paranoid sometimes, you know?

645
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,890
你都不会相信  我花了多长时间
You wouldn't believe how long it took her

646
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,280
才让她答应跟我约会
to just go out with me in the first place.

647
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,960
一生那么长
Forever.

648
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
还有其他在这儿住了一段时间的住户吗
Are there any other tenants who've been here for a while,

649
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,080
有没有住户  能带我们了解一下
you know, who might be able to show us

650
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,860
住在这里要注意的事  认识一下邻居
the ins and outs of the place, the neighborhood?

651
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,700
大楼两年前翻修过
Well, the building was totally renovated two years ago,

652
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,510
所以我们大部分的住户都是搬来不久的
So most of our tenants are newer.

653
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,230
我们一月份才重新开放的
We only reopened in January.

654
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,160
但我觉得会有些
But I think there are

655
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,990
老住户在这儿直接租了新居
some of the old tenants who bought in.

656
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,150
你说我们能跟他们谈谈吗
You think that we might be able to speak to them?

657
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,170
-就是想确认一下  -会让我们
- Just to be sure. - It would really make us

658
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,890
心里舒坦点
feel more comfortable.

659
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:25,930
她精力特充沛
She's feisty.

660
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,200
-我们可相爱了  -那是  那是
- So in love, so in love. - Yes, we are.

661
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
你来找我  是因为你想找个
You came to me because you wanted someone

662
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,830
认为你不会说谎的人帮你
who knows you always tell the truth.

663
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,930
-可你说谎了  -你在说什么啊
- Well, you don't. - What're you talking about?

664
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,670
丽萨的事
Lisa.

665
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,150
我那时问你  我们分开前
I asked you back then if anything had started

666
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,790
你们是不是就有一腿了
before we were separated.

667
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,340
你说没有  我也相信你了
You said it hadn't and I believed you.

668
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,870
那是因为我不想伤害你
'Cause I didn't wanna hurt you.

669
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,330
你想知道什么伤到我了吗
You wanna know what hurts me?

670
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,320
我原以为是我的事业心导致了我们离婚
I thought it was my ambition that caused our divorce.

671
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,720
-我从没这么说过  -是没有
- I never said that. - No.

672
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,390
但你让我以为是这样
But you let me believe it.

673
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,550
我本不该在那时与Lisa有染
I shouldn't have started with Lisa when I did,

674
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,910
可早在那之前
but it happened long after

675
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,020
你我就都清楚  我们的感情难以维系了
you and I both know we weren't working.

676
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,230
我很抱歉
Now I'm sorry.

677
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,160
抱歉我当时没有勇气说真话
Sorry I didn't have the courage to tell you then.

678
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,270
-那现在呢  -现在怎么了
- What about now? - Now?

679
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,100
那些人是在歪曲事实
They're manipulating the facts.

680
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,520
我不会为了  在我快一无所有之时
And I'm not going to apologize just because we happened

681
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,760
突然时来运转  而道歉
to hit it big when I was about to lose everything.

682
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,840
不论怎样我都会为你辩护的
I'm gonna defend you either way

683
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,280
因为我接了你的案子  这是我的工作
because I took this case, and that's what I do.

684
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,820
但如果我要堵上我的名声
But if I'm gonna stake my reputation on this,

685
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,850
我就要知道还有没有别的谎言
then I need to know if there are any other lies

686
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,480
会冒出来背后捅我一刀
that are gonna come up and sandbag me.

687
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,480
我现在就要知道
And I need to know right now.

688
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,520
谢谢
Thanks.

689
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,710
看来我们有很多话要聊了
I see I have some catching up to do.

690
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,550
人都是年少无知啊
People are stupid when they're young.

691
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,580
-你知道为什么吗  -我想知道
- Do you wanna know why? - I wanna know why

692
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,630
为什么他们在余下的生命里也那么无知
they're stupid all the other years of their lives.

693
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,520
格兰菲迪  不错啊
Glenfiddich. Smooth.

694
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,970
真不错
That's nice.

695
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,270
你从没结过婚
You never got married.

696
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,210
现在我们要分享私生活了吗
Now we're sharing our personal lives?

697
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,230
"直到死亡将我们分开"
"Till death do us part."

698
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,700
我还真信了
I actually believed it.

699
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,620
他在临床试验上造假了吗
Did he falsify the clinical trials?

700
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,870
他说他不会那么做的
He says he wouldn't do that.

701
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,400
那我们干嘛喝闷酒
So why are we drinking?

702
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,390
他说他不会那么做的
He says he wouldn't do that...

703
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,530
因为他本人也需要这药见效
because he needs the drug to work.

704
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,570
他要死了
He's dying.

705
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,970
奎汀也有肌萎缩侧索硬化症
Quentin has A.L.S.

706
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,820
帕克小姐  你为桑兹先生工作多久了
Miss parker, how long have you worked for Mr. Sainz?

707
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,220
实际上我是独立顾问
Well, technically, I'm an independent consultant.

708
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,600
但我从艾米林克斯研发之初就在这儿工作了
But I've been a part of Amylinx from the beginning.

709
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,200
是啊  我想你也是
Yes, I imagine you have been.

710
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,200
我们要确立你的可信程度
We're just trying to establish your credentials

711
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,660
好为他作证
for testifying for him.

712
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,060
你知道奎汀有肌萎缩侧索硬化症多久了
How long have you known Quentin had A.L.S.?

713
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,790
-一开始就知道  -那你知道
- From the beginning. - And how long have you known

714
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,120
他为了自救在实验结果上造假
Quentin falsified trial results to get the drug on the market,

715
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,850
-好让药早点上市多久了  -你说什么
- to save his own life? - What?

716
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,760
他才不会那么做呢
No, he wouldn't do that.

717
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,770
少来了丽萨  我们是一边的
Come on, Lisa, we're all on the same team here.

718
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,200
我们在想办法保护你爱的男人
We're trying to figure out how to protect the man you love.

719
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,800
我以为你相信他呢
Well, I thought you believed in him.

720
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,740
奎汀跟我还是夫妻的时候
You slept with Quentin

721
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,970
你就跟他上床了
while he was married to me.

722
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,200
他之前说没有这回事  我也信了
He said it never happened, and I believed him.

723
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,990
但现在我知道他会撒谎
But I have learned that he can lie.

724
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,450
所以我现在还相信他吗  不了
So do I believe in him now? No.

725
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,510
现在是在控制损失
This is damage control.

726
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,770
我们在努力保护他
We're just trying to protect him.

727
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,640
因为他们会查出来  他会被抓起来
Because they will find out, and he will get caught,

728
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,070
如果你不跟我们说实话
And if you don't tell us the real facts,

729
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,840
我们没法减缓他撒谎带来的损失
we can't mitigate the damage from his lie.

730
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,100
但他没撒谎
But he didn't lie.

731
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,720
我发誓
I swear.

732
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,670
-他没有  -但你撒谎了  是不是
- He didn't. - But you did, didn't you?

733
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,530
他当时病了
He was sick,

734
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,910
他需要那药
he needed the drug,

735
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,090
你为了得到药物管理局的批准不惜代价
And you would've done anything for FDA approval.

736
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,280
说吧  丽萨  帮我们帮他
Come on, Lisa, help us help him.

737
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,600
你没看到他当时的样子
You didn't see what he was like.

738
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,040
他都  不像他自己了
He was... barely Quentin then.

739
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,350
之后他有所好转
And then he got better.

740
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,910
我从没见过那样的事
And I've never seen anything like it.

741
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,940
是我发现了那件事
I was the one to see it.

742
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,660
到底发现了什么
See what, exactly?

743
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,080
六个月的实验  一百人里有一个
6 months in, 1 person out of the 100

744
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,520
开始出现肝功衰竭
started showing signs of liver damage.

745
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,350
而这会危及到获批的事
And that would jeopardize approval.

746
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,600
没错  我不能冒这个险
Yeah, and I couldn't take that chance,

747
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,520
所以我把那人请出研究了
so I took the person out of the study.

748
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,870
你没跟奎汀说过吗
You never told Quentin?

749
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,190
没  说了他会再等下去的  可我们没时间了
No, he would've waited, and we didn't have the time.

750
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,410
他没时间等了
He didn't have the time.

751
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,910
而我爱他
And I love him.

752
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,550
我还能怎么做
So what else could I do?

753
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,680
这个真相倒有一点优势
Look, there is an upside to all of this.

754
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,720
什么优势
Upside?

755
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,010
我在不知情的情况下  欺瞒了药管局
To the fact that I unknowingly defrauded the FDA?

756
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,040
关键就是你不知情
Well, the key word is unknowingly.

757
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,760
丽萨是个外来的承包人
Lisa's an outside contractor.

758
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,610
公司对实际造成的伤害要负责
The company may be liable for actual damages,

759
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,110
但我们可以把诈骗的罪名  转嫁到丽萨身上
but we can shift the blame for the fraud to Lisa.

760
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,320
会赔点小钱
There'd be a small payment,

761
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,970
但或许能让你的药留在市场上
but you might be able to keep the drug on the market.

762
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,290
就让丽萨当炮灰了吗
And throw Lisa under the bus?

763
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,230
是她先陷你于不利境地的
She was throwing you under the bus.

764
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,960
她是想救我的命
She was trying to save my life.

765
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,280
她会被刑事起诉吗
Would there be criminal charges?

766
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,050
有可能  她该自己请律师
Possibly. She should get her own lawyer.

767
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,720
我们之间利益有冲突
It's a conflict for us.

768
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,410
我们的目标是保护你
Look, our goal is to protect you.

769
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,500
我不确定
Sh...I don't know.

770
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,730
还有一个选择
There is an alternative.

771
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,060
你可以加入彻奇的诉讼
You can join Church's lawsuit.

772
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,910
杰西卡  我们是这公司的律师
Jessica, we're lawyers for the company.

773
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,410
我们不能建议他这么做
We can't advise him to do that.

774
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,310
-哈维  这是他的人生  -那不是重点
- Harvey, this is his life. - That's not the point.

775
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,400
这是我的案子  我说了算
This is my case, my call.

776
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,840
等等  那将意味着什么
Wait, wait, wait. What would that mean?

777
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,100
桑兹药厂将倒闭
Sainz pharmaceuticals would go down,

778
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,270
但你能分到调解费的一部分
but you'd share in the settlement.

779
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,870
你能再开个新公司
You could open a new company,

780
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,460
用另一个公司的名义继续卖你的药
keep the drug alive under a different corporate umbrella.

781
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,010
我不会假装跟他们一样是受害者
I'm not pretending I'm one of them.

782
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,490
你就跟他们一样
You are one of them.

783
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,130
我不能那么做  我不是那种人
Look, I can't do that. It's not who I am.

784
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,760
还有没有别的办法
Now isn't there another way?

785
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,120
你确实跟他们同病相怜
You are one of them.

786
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,450
他们也跟你同病相怜
And they're one of you.

787
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,270
迈克  我们有活要干  你在哪
Mike, we got work to do, where are you?

788
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,350
我现在看到你在第三会议室里呢
Oh, I'm looking at you right now in conference room C.

789
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,020
抱歉  我要失陪一下
I'm sorry, can you please excuse me?

790
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,380
在办公室里开戒酒互助会吗
AA meeting? Here in the office?

791
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,970
真好笑  不是  是我的诉讼
Funny. No, it's my lawsuit.

792
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,170
-什么诉讼  -跟强尼・卡里斯基打的那个
- Which suit is that? - Against Johnny Karinski.

793
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,720
弗兰克住的那栋楼
Between Frank's building

794
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,520
还有我跟瑞秋打算租下的那栋
and the one Rachel and I are about to buy into.

795
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,880
对了  我们结婚了
Oh, yeah. We're married.

796
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,160
说来话长
It's a long story.

797
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,760
你说让我大胆设想的  对吗
Look, you said think bigger, right?

798
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,070
我找到了15个前住户
I tracked down 15 former tenants

799
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,950
他们都愿出庭作证  他们受到各种骚扰
who are willing to testify to all manner of harassment

800
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,610
逼的他们不得不离开公寓
that forced them out of their apartments.

801
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
你连夜找来的吗
You did this overnight?

802
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,490
是啊  反正我也睡不着
Yeah, I couldn't sleep anyway.

803
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,110
总觉得有臭虫
Kept thinking I felt bedbugs.

804
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,550
如果我们把他们拉到法官面前
But I can get these people in front of a judge

805
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,350
说出他们的故事  那个薇薇安・塔纳卡
to tell their story, and there is no way

806
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,360
也没法扭转乾坤  救下卡里斯基的
that Vivien Tanaka can spin this to save Karinski's ass.

807
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,340
你该听听他们的故事
You should hear their stories.

808
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,970
很让人伤心  如果你还有良心的话
It'd break your heart. Uh, if you had a heart.

809
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,230
煽情是很好
Emotion is fine,

810
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,760
但是你最好还有冷酷无情的铁证做后盾
but you better have some cold, hard facts to back it up.

811
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,230
因为薇薇安・塔纳卡不是吃素的
Because Vivien Tanaka is no pushover.

812
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:42,920
但是
But...

813
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,890
做得不错  加油
It's good work. Keep at it.

814
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,500
我要去忙我该忙的了
I'm gonna go do what I gotta go do.

815
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,050
我们需要更多证据
We need more.

816
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,010
怎么才能得到更多的
How're we gonna get more?

817
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,980
迈克
Mike?

818
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,740
这是我们昨天去的大楼吗
Is this the building we were in yesterday?

819
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,900
不交房租就走人  是我的规矩
No rent, no apartment. That's my code.

820
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,360
对  前后照片对比
Yeah. Before and after.

821
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,570
我们得去买块地毯
We need to go carpet shopping.

822
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,240
我想你看见广告了
I see you found my ad.

823
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,540
这是在抢我的风头啊  哈维
Trying to steal my thunder, Harvey?

824
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,060
商学院  101条
Business school 101,

825
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,050
出自《商学院学到的101条》

826
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,180
遇到危机  要承认问题的存在
you have a crisis, you acknowledge the problem.

827
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,990
你们想要效仿的是泰诺药业  而非丰田汽车
You wanna be Tylenol, not Toyota.

828
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,340
都发生过产品召回事件

829
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,890
你现在承认这是个危机  为时稍晚
A little late for you to acknowledge this is a crisis.

830
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,390
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

831
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,560
非常感谢各位今天能来
thank you very much for coming here today.

832
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,270
奎汀・桑兹刊登了这则广告
Quentin Sainz placed this ad

833
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,160
因为你们的诉讼让他清楚认识到
because your lawsuit made it clear

834
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,550
他的药物有他自己也不知道的副作用
that his drug had side effects that he didn't know about.

835
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,600
我们想了解此次问题遍及的范围有多广
We wanted to know how widespread this problem was.

836
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,260
我们之前收到了很多答复
We had an outpouring of response.

837
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,630
但不是来自像你们这样痛苦挣扎的患者
Not from people struggling like yourselves,

838
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,370
而是来自那些渴望继续服用此药的患者
but from people desperate to keep the drug available.

839
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,280
你们认为是我们说谎
You think we're lying.

840
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,370
你们来这儿是因为你们认为公司
You're here because you think this company

841
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,020
对你们有所隐瞒
has been hiding things from you.

842
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,310
你们说的没错  他们确有隐情
And you're right. They have.

843
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,750
但是奎汀想要全盘托出
But Quentin wants to come clean.

844
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,370
他想要告诉你们
He wants to show you

845
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
他真正在隐瞒的是什么
exactly what it is that he's been hiding.

846
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:25,010
我无法松开拳头  也不能握住东西
I can't really open it. I can't hold anything.

847
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,590
我也不知道能坚持工作多久
And I don't know how much longer I can keep working.

848
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,950
会好起来的  会好的
It'll get better, it will.

849
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,440
你知道会的
You know it will.

850
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,210
我想是吧
I guess.

851
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,250
我把自己的生命都堵上了
I bet my life on it.

852
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,880
本身患上肌萎缩性侧索硬化症就很不公平
It's not fair you got A.L.S. in the first place.

853
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,900
再因为服用我所发明的药引发副作用
And it's definitely not fair you had side effects

854
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,910
而我自己吃了却没事  也绝对不公平
from the drug I created and I didn't.

855
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,460
但是现在我知道副作用的存在  
But now that I know they exist,

856
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,320
我想要完善它
I wanna fix them.

857
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,100
这样  像你们一样的人
So that people like you...

858
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,600
也许甚至于你们  都能像我现在一样健康
And maybe even you, can have what I have right now.

859
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,520
但是他办不到
But he can't.

860
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,300
如果他满足你们的索赔  他就办不到了
He can't if he gives you what you're asking.

861
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,790
我们不是说你们不配得到赔偿
We're not saying that you don't deserve compensation.

862
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,090
我们的承诺是这样的
Our commitment to you is this.

863
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,870
我们将提供给各位  公司的部分所有权
We are offering you partial ownership in his company.

864
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,840
一个正在试图拯救生命的公司
A company that is trying to save lives.

865
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,650
钱不会延续你们的生命
Money isn't going to help you live longer.

866
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,220
接受这条件吧  让奎汀
Taking the deal, and letting Quentin

867
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,360
努力去解决问题
try and fix the problem could.

868
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,100
不管你们乐不乐意
Like it or not...

869
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,770
你们都是一条船上的
You're all in the same boat.

870
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,660
给奎汀一次机会
Give Quentin the opportunity

871
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,770
保住这条船  别让它沉了
to keep that boat from sinking.

872
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,090
他们真的接受了条件
They really took the offer.

873
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,660
彻奇不喜欢这个结果
Church didn't like it.

874
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,610
但他们也不喜欢彻奇
But they didn't like church.

875
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,500
他们喜欢你
They liked you,

876
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,000
和我
and me.

877
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,230
谁不喜欢你呢
Who wouldn't?

878
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,330
你妈从来都不喜欢我
Your mother was never a fan.

879
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,630
你想要听真话吗
You wanna know the truth,

880
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,470
我父亲也不太喜欢
my father wasn't much of a fan either.

881
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,250
这句就是谎话了  我知道
Now that is a lie and I know it.

882
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,880
真话是
The real truth is,

883
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,890
他们从一开始就认为你比丽萨要好
they'd both take you over Lisa in a minute.

884
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,450
对不起
I'm sorry.

885
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,490
对不起
I'm sorry too.

886
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,750
从此以后  绝无谎言
From now on... back to no more lies.

887
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,970
如果要这么说定的话
Well, if we're gonna do that...

888
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,240
你记得那次你的捷豹停在门外
You remember that time that your jag got sideswiped

889
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,800
被刮蹭的事吗
when it was parked outside the house?

890
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:54,890
记得
Yeah.

891
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,010
其实事实并非如此
Yeah, it didn't exactly go down that way.

892
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,950
当时我太生气了
I was mad.

893
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,450
你生气了
You were mad?

894
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,360
你买的午饭太难吃了  我们本可以一起吃的
Oh, you brought a sack lunch. We would've shared.

895
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,640
真好笑
Amusing.

896
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,120
这也是  你的小诉讼案
As was this, your little lawsuit.

897
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,250
带上你的垃圾礼物赶快逃吧  孩子
Take your sack of presents and run, kid.

898
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,810
你这是在自找麻烦
You're in way over your head.

899
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,570
我认为他会没事的
Oh, I think he'll be just fine.

900
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,290
-你好啊  薇薇安  -你好
- Hello, Vivien. - Hello.

901
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,400
菜鸟找来了行家
So the rookie called in the veteran.

902
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,420
不  我就是来围观的
No, no, I'm just here to watch.

903
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,020
我就喜欢有观众的比赛
I love spectator sports.

904
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,990
你喜欢观战洋基队击败小小弱旅吗
You enjoy watching the Yankees destroy a little league team?

905
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,490
美国联盟东区的棒球队伍之一

906
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,620
大卫和巨人的故事恰好是
David and Goliath happens to be

907
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,450
我的最爱之一
one of my favorite stories.

908
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,270
出自《圣经》, 牧羊人大卫杀死了强大的巨人

909
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,780
好吧  随你的愿  包里是什么
Okay, I'll bite. What's in the bag?

910
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,560
你在干什么
What're you doing?

911
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,440
你认出这张地毯了吗
Oh, do you recognize this carpet?

912
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,770
让他把那玩意弄出去
Make him get that out of here.

913
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,700
这是您的地毯  卡里斯基先生
This is your own carpet, Mr. Karinski.

914
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,200
这是从弗兰克・卡维罗的公寓里拿来的
It's from Frank Carvello's apartment.

915
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,110
来  感受下这纤维  这纹理
Come on. Feel the fibers, the texture,

916
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,520
就跟活的一样
it's almost alive.

917
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,130
你把臭虫都带来了
You brought bedbugs in here.

918
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,740
这是破坏公物  侵犯人身罪
That's vandalism, assault.

919
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,390
我很高兴你这么说
You know, I'm happy that you put it that way,

920
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,310
因为那正是我们将要起诉你委托人的罪名
because that's what we're gonna be charging your client with.

921
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,380
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

922
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,340
他不是没能抵住臭虫袭击
He didn't just fail to eradicate a bedbug infestation,

923
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,110
他是臭虫制造者
he actually created one.

924
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,080
他从某幢旧楼中拽出一块地毯
Yeah, he pulled the carpet from one of his old buildings--

925
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,110
一块已遍布臭虫的地毯
carpet that was already infested--

926
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,270
然后他将它重新放回我委托人的公寓
and then he reinstalled it in my client's apartment

927
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,570
迫使其离开
to drive him out.

928
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,200
太胡扯了
That's crazy.

929
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,630
你也许该提醒你的委托人别作伪证
You might wanna warn your client about perjury.

930
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,910
房屋的入住情况  可是宣过誓的
We've got sworn testimony from the installer.

931
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,660
还有一张他的旧楼翻新前
And a picture of the same carpet

932
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,910
同样的那块地毯的照片
from one of his old buildings before it was renovated.

933
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,230
顺便说一句  我太太和我真的很喜欢
By the way, my wife and I really love

934
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,640
你改造后房屋的样子
what you've done with the place.

935
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,340
所以  我们要指控的罪名有
So it looks like we're talking about, what?

936
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,170
侵犯人身罪  违反租赁法规
Assault, violations of rental codes,

937
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,790
卫生管理条例
health codes,

938
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,620
就是些维持得体生活的基本条例啊
and you know, just basic codes of human decency.

939
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,410
如果纽约的陪审团听到那些
And if a jury in New York heard all that,

940
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,350
想想后果吧
wow, imagine the damages.

941
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,680
哈维  观而不语
Harvey... Spectate, please.

942
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,500
赶紧把那个毯子拿出去
Just get that carpet out of here.

943
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,910
那么  薇薇安
So, Vivien...

944
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,030
我第一次做得怎么样
How am I doing for my first time?

945
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,300
这还算是我的第一次  对吗
This still counts as my first time, doesn't it?

946
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,300
现在  我们不如谈谈你得赔多少钱吧
Now let's talk about how much this is going to cost you.

947
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,510
干吗
Yes?

948
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,100
觉得你会想知道
Just thought you'd like to know,

949
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,110
你的案件  无偿服务的那个  我赢了
your case, the pro bono... I won.

950
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,030
真为你高兴
How exciting for you.

951
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,700
但正如我所说  这只是无偿案件
But like I said, it's just a pro bono case,

952
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,030
对你的职业生涯并无帮助
it's not gonna help your career.

953
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,270
我还签下了15个新客户
I did also manage to sign 15 new clients

954
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,950
都想为同样的问题起诉
who are all suing for the same harassment,

955
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,290
而他们都会付钱
And they will be paying.

956
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,010
所以你可以将这个数字
So you can multiply this number...

957
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,690
乘以15
Times 15.

958
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,450
对于菜鸟来说做得不错了吧
That's not bad for rookie league.

959
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,580
拜托
Come on.

960
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,920
牺牲午餐时间值了吧
Tell me that wasn't worth missing your lunch hour for.

961
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,060
做你老婆真是太让我自豪了
It makes me proud to be your wife.

962
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,850
等等  这话从何说起
Yeah, wait, what is that coming up?

963
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,930
今天是我们三周年还是四周年结婚纪念吗
Is that our third, or our fourth anniversary?

964
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,230
五周年  你不觉得很重要吗
It's our fifth. Doesn't it mean anything to you?

965
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,930
当然觉得  实际上  我认为
Yeah. In fact, I think that

966
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,810
我们应该来个约会之夜以示庆祝
we should have a date night to celebrate.

967
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,740
你真搞笑
You're funny.

968
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,590
我是认真的
I'm serious.

969
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,780
我不能和同事约会
I can't date anyone from the office.
