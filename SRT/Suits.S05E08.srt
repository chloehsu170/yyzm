00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,410
{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,730
一开始
When we started this thing,

16
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,400
我只是为了拍你的马屁
I was just doing it to kiss your ass

17
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,710
好让杰西卡原谅我
so Jessica would forgive me.

18
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,740
但你是个真正的人才
But you're the real deal.

19
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,180
在我看来  杰克・索罗夫
As far as I can tell, Jack Soloff

20
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,910
遵守了他的承诺
is holding up his end of the bargain.

21
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,250
不只这样
He's doing more than that.

22
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,590
他还发了一封邮件提名你作为初级合伙人
He just sent out an email nominating you for junior partner.

23
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,130
什么
What?

24
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,440
我不会发一篇通讯稿
I'm not sending out a press release

25
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,430
宣布哈佛毕业的迈克・罗斯升职了
announcing Mike Ross of Harvard just got promoted.

26
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,060
这是什么
What is this?

27
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,340
是我记错了  还是我们没讨论过这事
Am I mistaken, or did we not have this discussion?

28
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,730
别再打给我了
Don't call me again.

29
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,650
你得告诉路易你一直在跟埃斯特上床
You need to tell Louis you've been sleeping with Esther.

30
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,990
我们只睡了一次
We slept together one time.

31
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,710
有什么区别呢
What difference does that make?

32
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,330
你向他承诺了你不会这么做
You promised him you wouldn't do it at all.

33
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,500
我得告诉你一件事
I need to tell you something.

34
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,210
-你向我保证过的  -我告诉你
- You made a promise to me! - I'm telling you.

35
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,500
因为他在可怜的童年时期遭受了什么破事
Because he's so messed up from whatever goddamn thing

36
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,000
导致他现在这么人渣...
happened to him in his pathetic childhood, he can't--

37
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,360
闭嘴
Shut the hell up!

38
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,420
给杰里・迈耶斯打个电话
Get me Jerry Myers on the phone.

39
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,870
杰里・迈耶斯
Jerry Myers?

40
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,490
路易  发生什么事了
Louis, what happened?

41
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,780
我告诉你发生什么事了
I'll tell you what happened.

42
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,020
哈维揍了我一拳
Harvey took a goddamn swing at me.

43
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,010
-就是发生了这事儿  -天呐
- That's what happened. - Oh, my god.

44
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,080
是啊  "天呐"  我要告死他
Yeah, "Oh, my god," I'm gonna sue the shit out of him.

45
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,150
好了  路易  你受伤了
Okay, Louis, you're hurt.

46
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,500
你要做的第一件事是弄些冰块来
The first thing you need to do is get some ice

47
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,270
并且冷静下来
and calm down.

48
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,810
你没听见我说的话吗
Did you not just hear me?

49
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,890
他打了我然后把我摔在了一张咖啡桌上
He hit me and then he threw me into a coffee table,

50
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,160
所以我要告死他
so I am going to sue the shit out of him!

51
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,960
我不认为起诉哈维是解决之道
I don't think suing Harvey is the answer.

52
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,060
你当然不觉得了  因为你想要保护他
Of course you don't, because you want to protect him

53
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,800
就像当时你骗我
like you did when you lied to me

54
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,610
没把他对埃斯特做的事告诉我一样
about what he did to Esther.

55
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,840
听我说  我告诉哈维要他自己和你坦白
Listen to me: I told Harvey to tell you himself.

56
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,850
而我骗了你
And I lied to you

57
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,630
是因为我知道你要不是听他亲口说
because I knew something like this would happen

58
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,600
就会发生像现在这样的事
if you didn't hear it directly from him.

59
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,940
确实是发生了  唐娜
Well, it did happen, Donna.

60
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,380
现在马上给我打电话给杰里・迈耶斯
Now get me Jerry Myers on the phone.

61
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,350
你想要我这么做  我会做的
You want me to do that, I will.

62
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,140
但你总是说我们是一家人
But you've always said we're a family,

63
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,560
而家丑不可外扬
and families keep things like this in the family.

64
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,860
我不确定说"恭喜"是否妥当
I'm not sure if congratulations are in order,

65
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,010
但既然我们没有别的选择
but since we have no other choice,

66
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,470
我还是选择说"恭喜"吧
I'm going to choose congratulations.

67
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,380
-你看见那个备忘了  -看见了
- You saw the memo? - I did.

68
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,740
你要当合伙人了
You're making partner.

69
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,280
不  瑞秋  我不会当的
No, Rachel, I'm not.

70
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,730
什么意思
What do you mean?

71
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,440
杰西卡要我拒绝
Jessica told me to turn it down.

72
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,390
她说这会给我吸引过多的注意力
Said it would draw too much attention to me.

73
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,400
简直疯了
That's crazy.

74
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,320
假如你拒绝了  就会吸引更多的注意力
If you turn it down, you'll draw even more attention to yourself.

75
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,550
我就是这么和她说的
That's exactly what I told her.

76
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,550
那她怎么说
And what did she say?

77
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,270
她说假如我足够聪明  不上法学院
She said that if I'm smart enough to be a lawyer

78
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,880
也能成为律师  那我也就足够聪明
without going to law school, I should be smart enough

79
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,780
能想出个借口拒绝掉
to come up with an excuse to turn it down.

80
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,860
放屁
Oh, that's bullshit.

81
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,550
你以为我不想当合伙人吗
You think I don't want this?

82
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,720
我想的
I do.

83
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,210
当我们一直都知道我永远也当不了合伙人
But we've always known I was never gonna make partner.

84
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,680
好吧  那你准备怎么办
Okay. What are you gonna do?

85
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,950
我要做和我惯常做法相反的事
I am gonna do the exact opposite of what I usually do.

86
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,820
我不会去证明杰西卡错了
Instead of trying to prove Jessica wrong,

87
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,510
而是会想出一个合理的借口
I'm gonna come up with a legitimate excuse

88
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,890
解释我为何不能接受
for why I can't accept it.

89
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,000
杰西卡
Jessica,

90
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,410
我要知道你过来
if I knew you were coming over,

91
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,390
会准备好龙舌兰和鸡蛋的
I would have made us some tequila and eggs.

92
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,900
而我会用它们糊你一脸
And I would have thrown them in your face.

93
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,240
那可不怎么友好啊
Well, that doesn't seem very nice.

94
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,860
我准备它们是想讨你欢心的
I cooked them just like you like them.

95
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,200
你觉得这很有趣吗
You think this is funny?

96
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,980
你攻击了一名冠名合伙人
You assaulted a name partner.

97
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,740
而我在和你打哈哈就是因为我不想听这个
And I'm making jokes because I don't want to hear it,

98
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,010
因为他是罪有应得
because he got what he deserved.

99
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,960
我不在乎他有多大罪过
I don't care if he deserved a court martial.

100
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,770
那种行为不能存在于我的律所当中
That kind of behavior cannot exist in my firm!

101
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,990
你是说我们的律所吧
You mean our firm?

102
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,360
假如是我们的律所
If it's our firm,

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,240
那么也是路易的律所
then it's Louis's firm, too.

104
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,980
好了  我明白你的意思了
Okay, you made your point.

105
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,150
我不会再犯了
I won't do it again.

106
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,100
你以为我大老远跑到你这里来
You think I came all the way down here

107
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,440
只为了说教你吗
just to give you a speech?

108
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,990
你从明天开始休两周的假
You're taking two weeks starting tomorrow.

109
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,190
我去度假
Me going on vacation

110
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,070
可不能阻止路易对付我
isn't gonna stop Louis from coming at me.

111
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,870
会阻止的  因为假如在之后的两周内
Yes, it is, because if you set foot

112
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,990
你踏进办公室附近的任何区域
anywhere near the office in the next two weeks,

113
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,480
我保证他会申请停你职停三个月的
I guarantee he will call for a three-month suspension.

114
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,370
那就不要让他这么做啊
Then don't let him.

115
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,090
哈维  我们律所是有规章制度的
Harvey, there are bylaws in place,

116
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,160
而阻止他的唯一办法就是你休假
and the only way to stop him is you being on vacation.

117
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,550
唯一的问题是
The only problem with that is,

118
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,720
人人都知道我从不休假
everyone knows I don't take vacations.

119
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,880
那为何我手上有你两个月前
Then why am I holding your request

120
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,870
写的休假申请
that you filled out two months ago?

121
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,900
路易不会买账的
Louis is never going to buy that.

122
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,340
我才不管他是否买账呢
I don't give a shit whether he buys it or not.

123
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,600
但在你开始你的小旅途之前
But before you go on your little trip,

124
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,400
你得夹着尾巴去找他
you're going to go to him with your tail between your legs

125
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,510
然后告诉他你之前百分百错了
and tell him that you were 100% wrong.

126
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,860
杰西卡  你好呀
Jessica, hey.

127
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,200
有什么能为您效劳
What can I do for you?

128
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,970
你可以告诉我
Well, you can tell me

129
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,990
为何提名迈克・罗斯做初级合伙人
why you nominated Mike Ross for junior partner

130
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,630
但却没想着要知会我一声
and didn't think to run it by me.

131
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,450
这是公开提名
It's an open nomination.

132
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,010
我不觉得自己必须和你说
I didn't think I had to.

133
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,390
我没说你必须
I didn't say you had to.

134
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,350
我只是问你为什么没说
I asked you why you didn't.

135
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,360
我不明白
I don't understand.

136
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,420
是你逼他和我合作的
You were the one who forced him to work with me.

137
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,250
我是说和他合作  而不是背着我提名他
I said work with him, not nominate him behind my back

138
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,790
只为了对付哈维
just to stick it to Harvey.

139
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,710
杰西卡  我们还要讨论几次这件事
Jessica, how many times are we gonna have this conversation?

140
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,710
你给了我一个求和的机会
You gave me a chance to make peace

141
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,600
而我抓住了这个机会
and I took it.

142
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,210
而且到现在我也没听到一个好理由
And I still haven't heard one good reason

143
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,960
解释为何不能给迈克升职
why Mike shouldn't be promoted.

144
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,030
我没说他不够格当合伙人
Oh, I didn't say he didn't deserve to be partner.

145
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,010
那我撤回我的备忘
Then how about I retract my memo

146
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,060
让哈维来提名他如何
and let Harvey nominate him instead?

147
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,960
除非有原因导致这样你也不愿意
Unless there's some reason why you don't want that either.

148
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,090
因为与其跟我谈这件事
Because instead of talking to me about this,

149
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,060
你更该跟我谈谈昨晚路易和哈维之间
you should be talking to me about what happened last night

150
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,580
发生的事
between louis and harvey.

151
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,650
-进展如何  -不太好
- How's it going? - Not great.

152
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,040
你还没找到拒绝提名的方法
You haven't found a way to turn down the nomination?

153
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,950
我想出了15种拒绝的方法
Oh, I've found 15 ways to turn it down.

154
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,230
但都不够好
But none of them are good enough.

155
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,220
肯定有一个很完美
Come on, one of them has to be good enough.

156
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,980
瑞秋  拒绝的理由不是重点
Rachel, it's not about the excuse,

157
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,900
重点是我得能直视那些人的眼睛
it's about me being able to look these people in the eye

158
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,270
说服他们相信这个理由
and convince them that it's true,

159
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,610
可我做不到
and I can't do that.

160
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,680
好吧
Okay.

161
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,770
那你要怎么办
What are you gonna do?

162
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,050
不知道
I don't know.

163
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,350
我知道
I do.

164
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,970
你要处理这个
You're doing this.

165
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,420
作为经营合伙人
As managing partner,

166
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,050
我正式委派给你第一个案子
I am officially giving you your first case.

167
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,680
-天哪  -怎么了
- Oh my god. - What?

168
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,510
经营合伙人给初级合伙人
It's tradition that the managing partner

169
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,460
分配升职后第一个案子是律所的传统
to give all new junior partners their first case.

170
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,490
-这是那个案子吗  -没错
- Is that what this is? - Yes, it is.

171
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,890
恭喜你  迈克
Congratulations, Mike.

172
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,950
虽然此事不在我计划之中
It may not be what I wanted,

173
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,140
但我是真心认为你值得这个职位
but I really did mean it when I said you deserve it.

174
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,490
谢谢你  杰西卡
Thank you, Jessica.

175
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,500
我不敢相信居然就这么成了
I can't believe that just really happened.

176
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,680
你是律所迄今为止最年轻的初级合伙人
You are the youngest junior partner the firm has ever had.

177
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,680
迈克  我真为你骄傲
Mike, I'm so proud of you.

178
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,400
那接下来就只剩一件事要做了
Well, that means there's only one thing left to do.

179
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,130
瑞秋・伊丽莎白・赞恩
Rachel Elizabeth Zane,

180
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,710
你愿意做我成为合伙人后
will you be the associate

181
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,960
第一个案子的助理律师吗
on my first case as partner?

182
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,930
愿意  我愿意
Yes. Yes.

183
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,250
问我多少次我都愿意
A thousand times, yes.

184
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,460
我不懂
I don't understand.

185
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,100
你是说你为打了路易感到很抱歉吗
Are you saying you're sorry you hit Louis?

186
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,840
我说的是我很遗憾没打得再狠点
I'm saying I'm sorry I didn't punch him harder.

187
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,500
如果是这样  我认为休假两周
In that case, I think taking two weeks off

188
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,900
的确是最合理的做法
is the best thing right now.

189
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,870
因为你现在
Because your emotions

190
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,380
完全被情绪所左右了
are completely ruling you.

191
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,310
想让路易闭嘴可不是被情绪左右的表现
Wanting to shut Louis up isn't being ruled by emotions.

192
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
这叫人有人性
It's being human.

193
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,220
但还有其他方法可以做到这一点
And there are other ways you could have tried to do that.

194
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,000
-比如  -比如转身离开
- Such as? - Walking out the door, for one.

195
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,690
我可不会离开我自己的办公室
I'm not walking out of my own office.

196
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,530
为什么
Why not?

197
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,390
因为别人拿枪指着你的时候
Because when someone points a gun at you,

198
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,060
你不能转身逃跑
you don't turn around and run away.

199
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,980
你要抢下枪  威胁回去
You take it out of their hand and you point it right back.

200
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,630
有时候让对手放弃攻击的最好方法
Well, sometimes the best way to get someone

201
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,490
是你自己先放下盔甲
to stop firing bullets at you is to take off your armor.

202
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,620
你说的那叫什么攻击
What the hell kind of bullets are you talking about?

203
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,180
情绪上的
Emotional ones.

204
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,480
哈维  路易朝你发火是因为他痛苦
Harvey, Louis lashed out at you because he was feeling pain,

205
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,250
而他用愤怒来掩盖他的痛苦
and instead of showing you his hurt, he covered it with anger.

206
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,920
那是他的问题  不是我的
Well, that's his problem, not mine.

207
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,140
要我说  其实你俩的问题一模一样
Actually, I'd say you two have exactly the same problem.

208
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,870
你说什么
Excuse me?

209
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,150
你与他的做法一模一样
You did the same thing to him that he did to you.

210
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,420
你用愤怒掩盖自己的痛苦
Instead of showing your hurt, you lashed out in anger.

211
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,570
唯一的区别是你动了手
The only difference is, is that you did it with fists.

212
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,790
他只动了嘴
He did it with words.

213
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,830
你是让我告诉他  我在看心理医生
Are you saying that I should tell him I'm in therapy

214
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,520
再跟他谈谈我的问题
and talk about my issues with him

215
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,240
然后我俩就能手拉手唱圣歌了吗
so we can sit around singing kumbayah?

216
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,990
我是劝你  如果你觉得路易应该为
I'm saying that if you think Louis should be sorry

217
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,970
朝你发火感到抱歉  那你至少
for lashing out at you, the least you can do

218
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,480
应该为朝他动手向他道歉
is apologize for lashing back at him.

219
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,750
路易  你怎么样了
Louis. How are you?

220
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,390
少客套了  我没兴趣
Cut the small talk. I'm not interested.

221
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,590
那么你找我有什么事
In that case, what can I do for you?

222
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,970
你可以拿哈维是怎么被罚的做开头
You can start by telling me how Harvey's being punished.

223
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,570
-那是我和哈维之间的事  -真有意思
- That's between me and Harvey. - That's funny.

224
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,870
他打我的时候  还是我和他之间的事呢
When he was attacking me, it was between me and Harvey,

225
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,430
我想知道你要怎么处理
And I want to know what you're gonna do about it.

226
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,420
我说过了  那跟你无关
And I just said, it's none of your business.

227
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,840
那么你作为经营合伙人  我要通知你
Then as managing partner, you should know

228
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,650
我要起诉你的大宝贝
that I'm suing your favorite son

229
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,130
罪名是骚扰和殴打
for assault and battery.

230
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,080
路易  你还没正式提交文件
Louis, you haven't filed that yet,

231
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,750
所以你不如告诉我你到底想怎样
so why don't you tell me what the hell you really want?

232
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,250
哈维得停职
I want Harvey suspended.

233
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,830
三个月  无薪  不能接触客户
Three months, no pay, no access to clients.

234
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,470
那不叫惩罚哈维
That's not punishing Harvey.

235
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,750
那是惩罚我们大家
That's punishing all of us.

236
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,300
你不愿意我自己来
Well, then I'll do it myself,

237
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,040
这是章程赋予我的权利
which I have the right to do under the bylaws.

238
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,880
路易  我本希望你现在已经冷静了
Louis, I was hoping you'd calm down.

239
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,870
如果两周后你还想这么做
But if you still feel this way in two weeks,

240
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,070
我也无力阻止
there's nothing I can do about it.

241
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,810
什么两周  你说什么呢
Two weeks? What the hell are you talking about?

242
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,890
你还没听说吧  哈维度假去了
You haven't heard. Harvey's on vacation.

243
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,310
一派胡言
Bullshit Harvey's on vacation.

244
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,620
哈维从来不放假
Harvey doesn't take vacations.

245
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,600
路易  你想让他走  他已经走了
Louis, you wanted him gone, and he's gone.

246
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,170
他亲笔签名的申请在这呢
And I have his signed requisition right here.

247
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,420
我不光希望他走
I don't just want him gone.

248
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,760
我还想当着全律所的面羞辱他
I want him humiliated in front of the whole firm,

249
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,550
而不是躺在土耳其什么地方的海滩上
not lying on a beach in Turks and Caicos

250
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,190
嘲笑你捏造的假申请
laughing at some fraudulent requisition you concocted.

251
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,580
那可是个恶劣的指控  路易
Oh, that's a nasty allegation, Louis.

252
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,790
你有证据吗
Do you have proof?

253
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,620
杰西卡  你这么做和我把哈维的工资单
You know what, Jessica, this is no different than me

254
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,330
放在复印机里没有差别
putting Harvey's salary in the copy machine.

255
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,170
差别大了去了  路易
Oh, it's entirely different, Louis.

256
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,190
你那么做是为分裂我们
You did that to rip us apart,

257
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,490
而我是为了把我们团结在一起
and I'm doing this to keep us together.

258
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,250
所以你还是赶紧离开我的办公室
So why don't you walk the hell out my office

259
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,000
仔细想想你到底想怎么玩下去
and think very carefully about how you want to play this?

260
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,480
他们来之前  我们先过一遍手里的信息
All right, before they get here, let's get our facts straight.

261
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,760
放松  我们的客户被谷歌提议收购
Easy, our client's being acquired by Google,

262
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,440
但奥泰拉软件公司有优先购买权
but Optela Software has a buy option.

263
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,870
他们宣称自己有优先购买权
Claims to have a buy option.

264
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,820
而且六个月前就过期了
It actually expired six months ago.

265
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,360
那为什么还跟他们见面
Then why are we having this meeting?

266
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,070
因为他们的律师不知道我们知道过期的事
Because their lawyers don't know we know that,

267
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,100
而且他们希望从中抽点好处
and they're hoping to get something to go away.

268
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,520
我要教你的太多了
Man, I have so much to teach you.

269
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,590
怎么  你现在成我上司了
What, are you my boss now?

270
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,390
这跟之前有区别吗
Oh, how is that different than before?

271
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,680
我现在可以甩手离开  留你孤军奋战
I could leave you high and dry right now.

272
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,930
你知道吧
You know that, right?

273
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,480
见鬼
Shit.

274
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,790
迈克  我只是在开玩笑
Mike, it was a joke.

275
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,390
瑞秋  我需要你独自解决这次会议
Rachel, I need you to handle this meeting by yourself.

276
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,550
-什么  怎么了  -他们的律师刚刚到了
- What? What's wrong? - Their lawyer just got here.

277
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,590
她吗
Her?

278
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,560
以前我当邮递员的时候
She used to work at a nonprofit

279
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,660
她在一家非盈利组织工作  明白吗
when I was a bike messenger, all right?

280
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,830
我们约过几次会
We went out a few times.

281
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,450
迈克  拜托  我能处理这种...
Mike, please. I can handle that--

282
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,400
不不不  她知道我没上过法学院
No, no, no, she knows I didn't go to law school.

283
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,860
-什么  -如果她看见我
- What? - If she sees me,

284
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,220
她就会知道我不是个律师  明白吗
she's gonna know I'm not a lawyer, all right?

285
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,290
我需要你来解决这次会议
I need you to handle this meeting.

286
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,390
-你能行吧  -不不  迈克  先别走
- Can you do that? - No, no, no--Mike, please.

287
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,310
你得给我点时间让我消化一下你说的话
You have to give me a second to process what you're saying.

288
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,410
瑞秋  我现在没有时间了
Rachel, I don't have a second.

289
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,960
-我需要你做这件事  -好吧
- I need you to do this. - Okay.

290
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,160
好吧
Okay.

291
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,040
克莱尔・鲍登
Claire Bowden.

292
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,090
瑞秋・赞恩
Rachel Zane.

293
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,140
我们开始吧
Shall we get to it?

294
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,230
好  当然
Yes, definitely.

295
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,280
我们...我们开始吧
Let's...let's get to it.

296
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,850
首先  我需要通知你
First of all, I need to inform you

297
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,240
我们准备申请临时禁制令
that we are prepared to move forward with a TRO,

298
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,050
当然  除非你的委托人改变心意
unless, of course, your client has had a change of heart.

299
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,040
你们可以这样做
You can do that.

300
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,490
我只是觉得不会有哪位法官会批准你的临时禁制令
I just don't see any judge granting you a TRO

301
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,540
考虑到你们的优先购买权已经过期了
given that your option has expired.

302
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,280
实际上  没有过期
Actually, it hasn't.

303
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,670
这是一份我们两边委托人之间的
This is a record of a phone call

304
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,500
通话记录
between our client and yours.

305
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,480
在这次通话中
A phone call during which

306
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,240
我的委托人同意帮助你的委托人修补漏洞
our client agreed to fix bugs in your client's software

307
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,690
以换取将我们的优先购买权
in exchange for a five-year extension

308
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,960
延期五年
of our purchase option.

309
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,670
我有点不明白  你们...
I'm confused. Do...

310
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,060
你们真的想要收购我们委托人的公司吗
Do you actually want to buy our client's company?

311
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,890
是的  如果确实要进行交易
Yes, if there's a deal happening,

312
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,000
我们希望能够实际参与其中
we want to be included in a meaningful way.

313
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,640
抱歉
I'm sorry.

314
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,730
我没有权力让你们参与任何交易
I'm not authorized to include you in any deal.

315
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,360
那就现在打电话给你的委托人
Then pick up the phone and call your client.

316
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,450
我明白了
I understand.

317
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,650
你也没有权力那样做  因为某个合伙人
You're not authorized to do that either because a partner

318
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,570
最后一刻把这个案子甩到你面前
dropped this in your lap in the 11th hour.

319
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,400
你绝对想象不出我现在的处境
You have no idea.

320
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,990
其实我明白  我也遇到过这种事
No, I've been there before.

321
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,870
但我确实需要给我的委托人一个答复
But I need something to take to my client.

322
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,770
所以请你尽快给我回音  好吗
So, get back to me as soon as you can?

323
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,520
好的  当然
Yes, absolutely.

324
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,700
太好了
Great.

325
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,180
顺便问一句
By the way,

326
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,000
办这个案子的合伙人多大年纪了
how old is the partner on this case?

327
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,980
问这个干什么
Why would you ask that?

328
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,190
因为我注意到他的名字是迈克・罗斯
Because I noticed that his name was Michael Ross,

329
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,050
我和一个迈克・罗斯约会过一次
and I went out with a Mike Ross once.

330
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,880
我只是想知道是不是同一个人
I was just wondering if it was the same guy.

331
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,590
因为如果是同一个人
Because if it is,

332
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,890
那他真是完全扭转了人生
he really turned his life around.

333
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,190
我...我也不确定他具体多少岁了
I...I'm sure how old he is.

334
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,280
这是我们第一次合作
This is the first time we've had a case together.

335
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,480
所以...大概45吧
So I--maybe he's about 45?

336
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,980
-那肯定不是他了  -抱歉
- Oh, definitely not him. - Sorry.

337
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,110
你不用说抱歉
Oh, you don't have to be sorry.

338
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,160
我只是好奇而已
I was just wondering.

339
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,420
-谢谢  -应该的  当然
- Thank you. - Yes, of course.

340
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,360
怎么样
How'd it go?

341
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,020
-不怎么样  -发生了什么事
- Not well. - What happened?

342
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,950
他们的优先购买权并没有过期
What happened was their buy option didn't expire

343
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,700
因为结果发现我们做过一个延期交易
because it turns out we made a deal to extend it.

344
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,760
好吧  那确实让事情复杂化了
Okay, yeah, that complicates things.

345
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,170
他们会要求我们付更多的钱来解除优先购买权
They're gonna want to squeeze us for more money to go away,

346
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,550
但也没什么大不了的
but it's not that big a deal.

347
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,830
没什么大不了的吗
It's not that big a deal?

348
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,250
没什么大不了的吗
It's not that big a deal?

349
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,130
你从那间会议室里落荒而逃
You practically ran from that conference room

350
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,240
躲到这里  留我一个人去面对那个
to come and hide in here and left me to deal with a woman

351
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,360
知道你秘密的女人
who knows your secret,

352
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,870
然后你还告诉我没什么大不了的
and you're gonna tell me that it's not that big a deal.

353
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,600
我是说得向奥泰拉公司付钱没什么大不了的
I meant having to pay off Optela is not that big a deal.

354
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,460
你都没有告诉我她是怎么知道你的秘密的
You didn't even tell me how she knows your secret.

355
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,030
她不知道我的秘密  好吗
She doesn't know my secret, all right?

356
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,360
我告诉她我在上法学院
I told her I went to law school,

357
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,830
然后她发现我其实没有
and she found out I didn't.

358
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,340
如果她现在见到我
If she sees me now,

359
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,510
就会去仔细调查我  然后她就会发现
she's gonna look into me and then she'll know it.

360
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,230
那你当初为什么
And why did you tell her

361
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,690
要告诉她你在上法学院
that you went to law school in the first place?

362
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,940
-瑞秋  这不重要  -这对我很重要
- Rachel, it's not important. - It's important to me.

363
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,160
因为我想在她面前博得好印象
Because I wanted to impress her,

364
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,380
而一个小邮递员做不到那一点
and being a bike messenger wasn't gonna do it.

365
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,170
所以你为了和她约会而骗她吗
So you lied to her to get a date?

366
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,230
是的  我是那样做的
Yes, I did.

367
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,460
现在你不是唯一一个对她撒谎的人了
Well, you're not the only person who's lied to her now.

368
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,480
这话什么意思
What does that mean?

369
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,170
意思就是  她向我问起了你
What it means is, she asked me about you,

370
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,400
然后我不得不撒谎
and I had to lie to keep her from thinking

371
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,310
让她以为你不是她以前认识的那个迈克・罗斯
that you're the same Mike Ross that she knew before.

372
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,610
瑞秋  对不起  我...
Rachel, I'm sorry. I...

373
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,930
-你要去哪  -去处理你的案子
- Where are you going? - To work on your case.

374
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,000
至于那个上述的案子
As for the aforementioned case,

375
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,190
把证词练习记录发给委托人
send our client his practice depo,

376
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,360
而且要标出所有他不应该在宣誓后说的
and underline all self-incriminating things

377
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,340
自证其罪的话
that he's not supposed to say under oath.

378
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,660
那个白痴
Idiot.

379
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,230
接下来是...
Moving on to...

380
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,770
唐娜  快叫保安
Donna, call security.

381
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,580
我在自己的办公室里感觉不安全
I do not feel safe in my own office.

382
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,090
唐娜已经回家了
Donna went home.

383
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,640
我来单独和你谈谈
I'm here to speak to you alone.

384
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,150
为什么  这样你再打我
Why? So you can have no witnesses

385
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,150
就没有目击证人了吗
the next time you attack me?

386
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,380
不  这样我可以私下向你道歉
No, so I could apologize to you in private.

387
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,210
不行  不行  不行
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

388
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,970
你不能光道个歉就逃过这一次
You're not gonna apologize your way out of this one.

389
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,550
我不是来逃过什么的
I'm not here to get out of anything.

390
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,910
我是来说对不起的
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

391
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,980
我一时失控  我不该打你的
I flew off the handle, and I shouldn't have punched you.

392
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,440
你不只是打了我  你攻击了我
You didn't just punch me. You attacked me.

393
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,360
-路易  -扯淡
- Louis-- - Bullshit.

394
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,120
这都是扯淡
This is all bullshit.

395
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,360
你这个人根本就有问题
There is something wrong with you,

396
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,080
不管你对我说什么...
and there is nothing that you could ever possibly say to me--

397
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,330
我一直在看心理医生
I have been seeing a psychiatrist.

398
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,080
什么  不  不可能
What? No, you haven't.

399
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,170
这又是什么花招
This is some kind of trick.

400
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,920
我一直在看心理医生治疗恐慌症
I've been seeing someone to get help for panic attacks.

401
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,200
你恐慌症发作过吗
You've been having panic attacks?

402
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,450
-是的  -在哪里
- Yes. - Where?

403
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,560
我不想说得太详细
Look, I don't want to get into it.

404
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,470
在哪
Where?

405
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,810
办公室里
In the office.

406
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,450
什么时候
When?

407
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,130
随时可能发作
They happen when they happen.

408
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,600
路易  我跟你说的是实话
Louis, I am telling you the truth.

409
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,200
天呐  这种情况持续多久了
My god. How long have they--

410
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,760
几个月前开始的
they started a few months ago.

411
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,520
几个...  唐娜离开时吗
A few--when Donna left?

412
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,160
没错  从唐娜离开时开始
Yes, when Donna left.

413
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,350
但不完全是因为唐娜
But it isn't really about Donna.

414
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,990
那只是个诱因  至少他们是这么告诉我的
That was a trigger--at least that's what they're telling me.

415
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,280
原因要深得多
It goes deeper.

416
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,870
跟我的家庭
My family,

417
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,290
我的感情问题  都有关
my relationships.

418
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,260
我现在正努力处理一堆糟心事
Let's just say I'm trying to work through some shit.

419
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,390
所以我说的那些话刺激了你的神经
So when I said those things, it struck a nerve.

420
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,510
不仅如此  路易
Oh, it did more than that, Louis.

421
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,110
那些话伤害了我
It hurt.

422
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,360
你也伤害了我  哈维
You hurt me too, Harvey.

423
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,890
我知道  我很抱歉
I know, and I'm sorry.

424
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,290
虽然这不是个借口
And it's not an excuse,

425
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,290
但我想让你知道我为什么打了你
but I wanted you to know why I did what I did

426
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,650
这一切的根源何在
and where it was coming from.

427
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,830
你不是真的要去特克斯和凯科斯群岛  对吧
You're not really going to Turks and Caicos, are you?

428
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,000
不知道  但我下午接受了治疗
I don't know, but I had therapy this afternoon,

429
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,160
还花了一整天时间
and I spent the rest of the day

430
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,170
考虑怎么做才最好
trying to figure out the best way to do this.

431
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,860
路易  埃斯特的事我很抱歉
Louis, I'm sorry for Esther.

432
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,090
很抱歉对你说谎
I'm sorry for lying to you.

433
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,850
也很抱歉打了你
And I'm sorry that I attacked you.

434
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,120
我接受你的道歉  哈维
I accept your apology, Harvey.

435
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,800
谢谢你  路易
Thank you, Louis.

436
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,360
那你不会再让我停职了
So you're not gonna try and suspend me?

437
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,880
让你停职
Suspend you?

438
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,250
杰西卡很确定你会想让我停职
Jessica was sure you'd want to suspend me.

439
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,290
杰西卡不知道你会说刚刚那些话
Jessica didn't know that you were gonna say what you said.

440
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,710
事实上  我知道杰西卡
As a matter of fact, I know jessica

441
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,240
让你休假只是为了缓解情况
only sent you on vacation to defuse the situation,

442
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,700
所以我觉得你明天应该回来上班
so I think you should come back tomorrow.

443
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,780
-你确定吗  -是的
- You sure? - Yes.

444
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,720
他们将宣布迈克晋升合伙人
They're announcing Mike's partnership,

445
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,000
我不希望你错过这个时刻
and I wouldn't want you to miss that.

446
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,080
-谢谢  路易  -这是我最起码能做的
- I appreciate that, Louis. - It's the least I can do.

447
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,010
我能跟你谈谈吗
Can I talk to you for a second?

448
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,050
如果是谈你成为高级合伙人的事
If it's about you becoming senior partner,

449
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,550
我觉得有点太早了
I think it's a little premature.

450
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,920
我们可能有麻烦了
We may have a problem.

451
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,270
可能  还是已经
May or do?

452
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,110
元桌面案子的对方代表律师
The lawyer on the other side of the Metadesk case

453
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,550
知道我没上过法学院
knows that I didn't go to law school.

454
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,160
什么
What?

455
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,430
会议前我看到她走进公司
I saw her come into the office

456
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,270
所以就让瑞秋接管了
before the meeting, so I had Rachel take over,

457
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,390
她还不知道我是她认识的迈克・罗斯
and she's doesn't know I'm the same Mike Ross she knew,

458
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,850
她也不会知道  但是
and she's not going to, but--

459
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,990
该死的第一个案子
Goddamn first case.

460
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,040
杰西卡  事情会解决的  我保证
Jessica, it's gonna be handled. I promise.

461
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,810
瑞秋会和我一起工作
Now, Rachel and I will work together,

462
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,260
但她将一直代替我出面
but she'll be out front the whole time.

463
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,230
除了让她应付着
Well, I guess we have no choice

464
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,420
我们也没有别的选择
but to let her ride it out.

465
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,640
但如果有人发现你第一个案子
But it's gonna look pretty damn sketchy

466
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,950
就交给助理  会显得有问题
if someone finds out you've handed off your first case.

467
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,410
所以才有了下一个问题
Which brings me to my next point.

468
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,350
杰克・索罗夫在过问这个案子
Jack Soloff has been asking about it.

469
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,690
那你最好保证不被他发现
Then you better make damn sure

470
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,990
你让瑞秋负责这个案子
you keep him from finding out you put Rachel in charge.

471
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,120
因为我们最不希望杰克・索罗夫
Because the last thing we need is for Jack Soloff

472
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,680
开始调查你的过去
to start sniffing around your past.

473
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,570
没错  我知道
Yeah, I know.

474
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,910
如果这些你都知道
Well, if you know all these things,

475
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,230
还来这做什么
then why exactly are you here?

476
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,030
因为你信任我  让我做了合伙人
Because you trusted me with being partner

477
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,300
我想让你知情
and I'm trying to repay that trust

478
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,550
借此来回报你的信任
by keeping you in the loop.

479
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,030
我很感激  迈克
I appreciate that, Mike.

480
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,800
但你回报我的最好方式
But the best way for you to repay me

481
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,600
就是首先确保那个律师
is by making sure that other lawyer

482
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,190
不会发现你那该死的秘密
doesn't find out your goddamn secret in the first place.

483
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,670
-有给我带吗  -没有
- Get one of those for me? - No, I didn't.

484
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,490
你不能像平时一样抢我的面包圈
And you can't take mine like you usually do.

485
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,690
放松点小老虎  我不是来抢你的面包圈的
Easy, tiger, I'm not here to take your bagel.

486
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,160
我是来给你这个
I'm here to give you this.

487
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,300
你怎么能这么快搞定
How'd you get that done so fast?

488
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,400
我有个熟人
I know a guy.

489
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,030
你有个熟人在做定制雕刻
You know a guy in custom engraving?

490
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,350
我到处都有熟人
I know a guy in everything.

491
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,620
谢谢  哈维  你不用这么做的
Oh, thanks, Harvey, but you didn't have to do that.

492
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,790
你又不是每天都有晋升合伙人这么好的事
Come on, it's not every day you make partner,

493
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,470
我认为没有人比你更应该得到这个职位了
and I've never known anyone who deserves it as much as you.

494
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,400
除了你之外
Except for you.

495
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,580
这一点我们心知肚明  不必说出口
Well, that goes without saying.

496
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,400
那你为什么要说
So why'd you say it?

497
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,910
因为不得不说
Because it had to be said.

498
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,310
说真的  迈克
Seriously, Mike,

499
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,300
这是你应得的  我很高兴你做到了
you deserve this. I'm glad you got it.

500
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,170
我只是希望我是那个晋升你的人
I just wish I could have been the one that made it happen.

501
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,630
我很高兴在和路易发生那样的事之后
I'm just glad you made it in for the meeting

502
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,760
你还能出席会议
after everything that happened between you and Louis.

503
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,600
不管你相信与否
Believe it or not, it was Louis who actually

504
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,980
是路易邀请我回来工作的
invited me to come back to work.

505
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,830
你怎么说服他的
How'd you manage to get him to do that?

506
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,570
即使我告诉你  你也不会相信
Well, you wouldn't believe me if I told you.

507
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,850
但即使他没有邀请我回来
But even if he hadn't invited me back,

508
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,200
就算来支军队也无法阻止我参加你晋升合伙人的表决
an army couldn't have kept me away from your partnership vote.

509
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,920
拜托  哈维  这只是个形式
Come on, Harvey, it's just a formality.

510
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,380
他们已经给了我头衔
They've already given me the title.

511
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,960
这也许只是个形式
It may be just a formality,

512
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,800
但如果我不投票支持  会议不可能举行
but that meeting's not happening without my vote on the record.

513
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,100
下一个待表决的项目正是
The next item up for bid on the price is right

514
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,950
迈克・罗斯被提名为
is Mike Ross's nomination

515
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,590
初级合伙人
for junior partner.

516
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,520
我知道这只是个形式
Now, I know it's just a formality,

517
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,580
但有人提出异议吗
but what do you say we make it unanimous?

518
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,920
所有支持这个决议的人请举手
All those in favor?

519
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,900
那么我很高兴地宣布迈克・罗斯
Then I'm pleased to announce Mike Ross

520
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,830
成为公司最新的初级合伙人
as this firm's newest junior partner.

521
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,500
如果没有其他事...
So, if no one else has anything--

522
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,540
我有事要说
I have something.

523
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,950
如果你们都在疑惑
If you're all wondering why

524
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,800
为什么我的头骨严重受伤
I have extensive damage to my skull,

525
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,780
那是因为两天前
it's because two nights ago,

526
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,070
哈维・斯佩克特恶意袭击了我
I was viciously attacked by Harvey Specter.

527
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,950
鱿鱼我希望不要去律所外部寻求司法途径
And since I would rather not go outside the firm

528
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,660
依照公司章程第28b条
to take legal action, pursuant to section 28-b of the bylaws,

529
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,040
我提议让哈维・斯佩克特立刻免薪停职
I am placing Harvey Specter on immediate unpaid suspension.

530
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,880
你这个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

531
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,410
我不知道这事该怎么解决
Okay, I don't really know how this works.

532
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,630
是不是有人该叫保安了
Should someone call security?

533
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,030
路易  我觉得没人需要叫保安
Louis, I don't think anyone needs to call--

534
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,830
-我有权利  -事实上路易  你没有
- It's my right. - Actually, Louis, it's not.

535
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,550
28章b条确实是停职章程  但是
Section 28-b does require suspension, however,

536
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,710
只有在合伙人
it's enforceable only

537
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,050
都投票认为你所言不虚的情况下
after a vote by the partners to determine

538
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,600
才能生效
if what you're claiming even happened.

539
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,180
-我所言不虚  -我没说不是
- Oh, it happened. - I'm not saying it didn't.

540
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,070
我只是在引述你自己写的章程原文
I'm just quoting the bylaws you wrote.

541
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,380
所以  我提议周五专门投票一次
Therefore, I'd like to schedule a vote for friday,

542
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,150
也好给大家一个认清事实的时间
once we've all had a chance to review the matter.

543
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,520
好吧  这不是我想要的
Okay, this is not what I want--

544
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,830
章程是你自己写的  路易
They're your bylaws, Louis...

545
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,160
就定在周五吧
So friday it is.

546
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,110
会议结束
Meeting adjourned.

547
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,980
瑞秋
Rachel.

548
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,630
-很高兴见到你  -我也是
- Good to see you. - You too.

549
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,850
我得承认  我很惊讶
I have to admit, I'm surprised

550
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,110
你们这么快就给了我回复
you're getting back to us so soon.

551
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,080
当我们意识到了你们的真实目的后
Well, once we realized what you really wanted,

552
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,310
就觉得无需等待了
we figured why wait?

553
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,720
那我们的真实目的是什么
And what is it that we really want?

554
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,840
说实话吧
Let's be honest.

555
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,460
你的委托人根本
Your client has no real interest

556
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,230
没有兴趣涉足执行软件行业
in the fulfillment software business.

557
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,440
不  其实并非如此
No, that's not actually true--

558
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,510
但你们确实延长了追诉期
But you do have an extension of your purchase option,

559
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,150
虽然庭上站不站的住脚还不一定
which may or may not hold up in court.

560
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,540
所以我们愿意出这个价钱来平息事端
So we're willing to pay you this to go away.

561
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,180
我觉得上次见面你可能对我的表达有误解
I think maybe you misunderstood me in our last meeting.

562
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,470
我不是什么法人杀手
I'm not some corporate killer

563
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,220
想以此要挟你们多给钱
who's looking to hold you hostage for a payoff.

564
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,290
我的委托人是真心想入伙
My client actually wants to be included in this deal.

565
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,080
克莱尔  这已经是很合理的出价了
Claire, this is an incredibly fair offer.

566
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,750
我并不认为这出价合理
I don't think this is a fair offer at all.

567
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,350
那就谈谈否则之后吧
Well, then let's talk about what would be,

568
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,320
因为你的委托人不可能入伙
because your client's not staying involved in this deal.

569
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,680
这是你上司的立场还是你的
Is this your boss's stance or yours?

570
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,620
是我们的委托人立场  也就是律所的立场
It's our client's, and my firm's,

571
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,620
而且我不喜欢你质疑
And I don't appreciate you questioning

572
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,940
我在交易里的地位
my role in this deal.

573
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,320
瑞秋  我昨天放你一马
Look, Rachel, I cut you some slack yesterday

574
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,160
是因为你是个不知所措的菜鸟
because you're a newbie who's in over her head,

575
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,670
但既然你无权
but since you clearly don't have the power

576
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,930
让我们入伙
to include us in this deal,

577
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,130
我认为我应该直接联系负责本案的合伙人
I think maybe I should call the partner on this case.

578
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,470
我告诉你  你可以这么做
You know what? You should.

579
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,810
因为他会告诉你
But he's just gonna say this:

580
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,710
如果你申请临时限制令  我们就会
if you pursue a TRO, we'll sue you

581
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,020
以侵权干扰生意业务关系罪起诉你
for tortious interference.

582
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,620
你说什么
Excuse me?

583
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,730
你本来就知道交易正在进行
You knew this sale was in process,

584
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,850
但你故意等到结算
and you waited till closing

585
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,340
才提出议案
to broach the topic.

586
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,420
-这就叫侵权干扰生意业务关系  -好
- That is tortious interference. - Okay.

587
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,510
看来我们也没什么好谈的了
Well, I think we're done here.

588
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,380
拿着钱离开吧
Just take the money and walk away,

589
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,690
否则我们会在法庭上纠缠好多年
or we will tie this up in court for years.

590
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,760
选择权在你们  可说回来  我知道什么呢
It's up to you. But then again, what do I know?

591
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,190
我只是个菜鸟
I'm just a newbie.

592
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,900
你这个满嘴谎话的贱人
You lying piece of shit.

593
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,010
我说谎是因为我不是你以为的那个蠢货
I lied because I'm not the fool you think I am.

594
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,140
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

595
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,200
我在说你的真心道歉
I'm talking about your apology from the heart.

596
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,300
你真的让我为你那些废话感动了
You actually had me falling for that bullshit

597
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,070
感动到你问我是不是要让你停职
until you asked me if I was gonna suspend you.

598
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,500
那一刻我就知道  全是控制
And then I knew it was just all a goddamn manipulation.

599
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,280
你觉得我敞开心扉  告诉你我有恐慌症
You think me opening up about having panic attacks

600
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,300
是为了控制你
is manipulation?

601
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,020
我都不觉得你真有恐慌症
I don't even think you really had panic attacks,

602
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,090
就更别说去看心理医生了
let alone are going to therapy.

603
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,700
我有  而我对你说出实情
Well, I am, and I opened up to you about it,

604
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,150
之后你却看着我的眼睛
and then you looked me in the eye,

605
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,430
利用迈克的晋升会议引我回来
and you used Mike's partnership to lure me back.

606
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,540
是的
Yes.

607
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,380
我是那么做了
I did.

608
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,570
因为我想让你知道
Because I wanted you to know how it feels when someone

609
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,050
一个人当你面承诺了一件事又做出完全相反的行为时
says one thing to your face and then turns right around

610
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,060
那种感受  就像你对我做的事一样
And does the exact opposite, like you did to me.

611
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,970
那这是对我睡你妹妹的报复吗
So this is payback for me sleeping with your sister?

612
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,580
-当然是  -你这个贱人
- Sure as shit is. - You son of a bitch.

613
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,580
我应该现在就把你拎出去
I should take you outside right now--

614
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,890
干嘛  再打我一次吗
And do what? Hit me again?

615
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,010
这次可就不只是停职了  哈维
Because this time it won't just be a suspension, Harvey.

616
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,730
-你会被开除  -够了
- You'll be gone. - That's enough.

617
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,790
没人要打谁
No one's hitting anybody.

618
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:03,130
哈维  在投票前  你不许跟他单独相处
Harvey, you're not to be alone with this man before that vote.

619
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,250
挺清楚了吗
Is that clear?

620
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,620
这事没完
This isn't over.

621
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,180
杰西卡  谢谢
Thank you, Jessica.

622
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,410
律所应该是个安全的环境
A law firm should be a safe environment,

623
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,020
而我开始觉得很担心...
and I started to feel like I was fearful--

624
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,320
闭嘴  路易
Shut the hell up, Louis.

625
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,120
你刚才的行为太卑鄙了
What you did in there was despicable.

626
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,190
极其卑劣  仇怨
It was underhanded and vindictive

627
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,630
对整个律所都有伤害
and harmful to the entire firm.

628
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,760
我猜你不会投票惩罚哈维了
I take it you won't be voting to discipline Harvey.

629
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,080
我就不会去投票
I won't be voting at all.

630
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,040
如果你以为自己能把我扯进这烂事
And if you think you're gonna drag me into your bullshit,

631
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,230
那你就得准备好其他麻烦了
then you have another thing coming.

632
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,640
你弃权随你
Oh, you can abstain all you want,

633
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,480
但所有人都会知道你的立场
but everyone's gonna know exactly where you stand.

634
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,520
他们早就知道我的立场
They already know where I stand.

635
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,900
绝不是支持你
And it's not with you.

636
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,470
你用起诉把她拍回去了
You slapped her with a lawsuit?

637
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,720
她联系你了
Did she call you?

638
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,730
不  她联系了谷歌  而谷歌给我电话
No, she called Google, and then they called me

639
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,260
说他们要退出交易
to tell me they're pulling out of the deal.

640
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,030
-什么  -是的  他们不希望
- What? - Yeah, they don't want

641
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,610
冒此时被扯进官司里的风险
to run the risk this thing gets tied up in litigation,

642
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,330
所以要退出
so they're out.

643
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,060
-迈克  我可以解释  -不  你不用解释
- Mike, I can explain. - No, you don't have to explain.

644
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,390
我们上次对话时你已经解释过了
You explained the last time we talked.

645
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:03,970
你说什么
Excuse me?

646
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,390
你对克莱尔有意见
You've got a problem with Claire,

647
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,100
你在用这案子发泄
And you're taking it out on this case.

648
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,170
我对克莱尔没意见
I don't have a problem with Claire.

649
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,210
我有意见的是你对她撒谎
I have a problem with you lying to her

650
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,550
说你上法学院
about going to law school.

651
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,780
但我威胁她要起诉的原因
But the reason I threatened that suit

652
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,080
是因为她不满意控制不住我
is because she didn't like not getting her way with me,

653
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,860
而想给你打电话
and she was going to call you instead.

654
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,010
你是避免了那种事发生
Well, you stopped that from happening,

655
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,060
但在此过程中  毁掉了整桩交易
and in the process, you blew up the entire deal.

656
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,170
你听我说了吗  她要给你打电话
Did you hear me? She was going to call you.

657
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,010
所以我很抱歉谷歌退出
So I'm sorry that Google pulled out,

658
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,310
可我没什么机会
but I didn't really have the chance

659
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,610
考虑所有选择
to think of every option--

660
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,280
所有选择  只有一个选择
Every option? There's only one.

661
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,740
就是你们再商量一个价钱
You negotiate another price.

662
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,870
你以为我没试吗
You think I didn't try that?

663
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,360
她唯一会接受的
The only thing she would have accepted

664
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,080
就是插足这个交易  没了
is being cut in on the deal, period.

665
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,490
我只知道如果当时我在场
All I know is that if I'd been there,

666
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,890
肯定会想出办法搞定
I would have figured out a way to get it done.

667
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,060
你忘了吗  你不可能在场
Well, you know what? You couldn't have been there.

668
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,440
而且我也不喜欢你现在告诉我
And I don't appreciate you telling me

669
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,790
我没有你优秀  因为一开始
that I'm not as good as you when the only reason

670
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,830
我参加那个会议就是为了
I was in that meeting in the first place

671
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,010
给你打掩护
was to cover for you.

672
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,040
瑞秋  抱歉  我没想针对你
Rachel, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make it personal.

673
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,480
你指责我因为嫉妒搞砸了
Well, it sure sounded personal when you accused me

674
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,390
当然就是针对我
of screwing up because I was jealous.

675
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,710
我刚说过抱歉
Look, I just said that I'm sorry.

676
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,250
我只是以哈维在这种情况下
I'm only coming down on you the same way

677
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,200
对待我的方式对待你罢了
Harvey would come down on me in the same situation.

678
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,900
行  可你不是哈维  我也不是你
Right, but you're not Harvey, and I'm not you.

679
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,060
如果是哈维用刚才
And if Harvey was talking to you

680
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,290
你对我的口气跟你说话
the way that you're talking to me,

681
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,120
你现在就会在这跟我抱怨他多混蛋了
you would be in here right now telling me what a dick he is.

682
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,770
-把那个给我行吗  -什么
- Can I have that, please?  - What?

683
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,680
我还没把你昨天的录音记完...
I haven't done your transcriptions since yesterday, so...

684
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,340
那不着急  回家吧
Oh, it can wait. Go home.

685
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,310
怎么了
What?

686
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,380
你今天太过分了  路易
You went too far today, Louis.

687
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,040
这么说你不是来做事的
So, you're not really here to do work.

688
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,340
你来只是为了帮哈维说话
You're here to once again take Harvey's side.

689
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,690
我没有要帮哈维
I'm not taking Harvey's side,

690
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,010
但你在会上的所作所为是不对的
but what you did in that meeting was wrong.

691
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,980
你告诉我家事不外扬  我照做了
You told me to keep it in the family, and that's what I did.

692
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,270
我的意思是让杰西卡处理  你也清楚
I meant let Jessica handle it, and you know it.

693
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,640
但杰西卡并没有处理
But Jessica didn't handle it.

694
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,390
她想让哈维去加勒比度假
She tried to send Harvey to the Caribbean.

695
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,500
那你唯一的选择就是
Oh, so the only thing that you could do was blindside him

696
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,930
在迈克升合伙人的会议上使阴招吗
in the same meeting where Mike is made junior partner?

697
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,420
他袭击了我
He assaulted me.

698
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,840
我明白  路易
I understand that, Louis.

699
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,400
但我不明白
But what I don't understand

700
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,040
为什么明明是你怒气冲冲的去找他
is why you're the one who went in there angry,

701
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,700
最后却是他打了你
and he's the one who ended up attacking you.

702
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,070
-唐娜  -你对他说了什么
- Donna-- - What did you say to him?

703
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,780
我犯不着跟你解释
I don't have to explain myself to you.

704
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,650
对  你犯不着  你爱怎么做怎么做
No, you don't, and you're free to do whatever you want.

705
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,200
我看到你被他打过的脸
But when I saw your face after he hit you,

706
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,350
我是真心为你难过
I felt horrible for you.

707
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,310
可既然你不告诉我你说了什么
But since you won't tell me what you said to him,

708
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,750
我开始觉得  可能不值得为你难过
I'm starting to wonder if I should.

709
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,170
这是什么
What's this?

710
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,100
我知道因为这个案子
I know you had to reschedule the cake tasting

711
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,490
得改期蛋糕试吃  所以
because of the case, so

712
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,750
我想我可以把蛋糕带回来给你尝
I thought I'd bring the cake tasting to you.

713
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,000
你不必这么做
You didn't have to do that.

714
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,510
我想  因为我想确定
I wanted to, because I wanted to make sure

715
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,160
你明白不管工作上发生什么
that you know that no matter what's going on at work,

716
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,010
你在我生命中都是最重要的
you're the most important thing in my life.

717
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,170
我知道你是在努力不让我被抓
I know you were just trying to keep me from getting caught.

718
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,860
我很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

719
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,870
我也是
I'm sorry, too.

720
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,180
为什么
What for?

721
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,300
尽管我很不想承认
Because as much as I hate to admit it,

722
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,050
我确实对克莱尔心存嫉妒
I do have a problem with Claire.

723
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:08,930
瑞秋
Rachel--

724
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,270
迈克  我当时就坐在她对面
Mike, I was sitting across the table from her,

725
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,580
我完全可以理解你当初为何喜欢她
and I could see all the reasons why you were interested in her.

726
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,490
我不禁去想如果她从未发现你撒谎
And I--I had to wonder what would have happened

727
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,340
又或者她在一年后
if she'd never found out that you lied,

728
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,630
更了解你时才发现
or if she found out a year later

729
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,520
事情又会怎样
after she'd gotten to know you better.

730
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,530
或许你们俩还在一起
Maybe the two of you would still be together.

731
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,090
-不会的  -你怎么知道
- We wouldn't be. - How do you know?

732
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,160
或许我想了一想才告诉你真相
Because it might have taken me a while to tell you the truth,

733
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,680
但从我第一眼见到你的时候
but from the first second I looked at you,

734
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,600
就想把我的一切摊开在你面前
I wanted to tell you everything about me.

735
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,080
当我终于告诉你真相时
And when I finally did tell you the truth,

736
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,570
你没说你再也不想见到我
you didn't tell me that you never wanted to see me again.

737
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,320
你接受了我
You accepted me.

738
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,500
实际上我扇了你一巴掌
Actually, I slapped you.

739
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,470
-然后你吻了我  -对
- And then you kissed me. - Yeah.

740
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,600
还继续和我在一起
And stayed with me.

741
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,390
无论如何都爱我
And loved me anyway.

742
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,780
-杰克  -有什么能效劳  哈维
- Jack. - What can I do for you, Harvey?

743
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,090
我想感谢你今天为我出头
I wanted to thank you for standing up for me today.

744
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,740
我告诉杰西卡我准备好跟团队合作了
I told Jessica I'm ready to be a team player.

745
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,810
或许现在你们俩会相信我了
Maybe now the two of you will believe me.

746
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,300
这我还不太确定
Well, I don't know if I'm willing to go that far,

747
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,090
但我感激你今天所做的
but I appreciate what you did.

748
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,330
能让我说几句吗
Can I speak freely?

749
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,300
说吧
Go ahead.

750
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,900
这是你应得的
You've earned it.

751
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,720
我告诉迈克
I told Mike the reason

752
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,230
我一开始就针对你是因为
that I went after you in the first place

753
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,300
对你来说一切都来得容易
was that everything comes easy to you,

754
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,610
但这么想的可不是我一个人
but I'm not the only one that feels that way.

755
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,540
你想说什么
What's your point?

756
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,710
我或许能暂时阻止路易
I may have stopped Louis

757
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,240
让你停职
from suspending you for the moment,

758
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,020
但投票的结果可能对你不利
but that vote's not gonna go well for you.

759
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,130
你是说我能做些什么改变结果
You're saying I can do something to change the outcome.

760
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,150
我是说你可以做些什么改变
I'm saying you could do something to change the way

761
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,960
其他合伙人对你的看法
the partners feel about you.

762
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,900
你希望我自愿接受停职吗
You want me to take this suspension voluntarily?

763
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,720
如果这事发生在一个月前
If this were a month ago,

764
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,580
我会希望你把名字从墙上拿掉
I'd want you to take your name off the wall.

765
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,570
但你的确需要做出谦逊的姿态
But you need to do something to humble yourself.

766
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,110
具体怎么做  是你自己的决定
What exactly that is, is up to you.

767
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,950
你怎么进来的
How did you get in here?

768
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,500
接待处告诉了我你的办公室
The receptionist told me where to find you.

769
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,410
她不该这么做
Well, she shouldn't have,

770
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,680
不如你自行离开吧
so why don't you find your way out?

771
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,900
克莱尔  我是来道歉的
Claire, I'm here to apologize.

772
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,090
你说我没经验
Look, you got under my skin

773
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,910
让我很不舒服
when you called me inexperienced

774
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,150
因为我确实没做多久
because the truth is I haven't been doing this very long.

775
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,040
所以我就采取反击
So I shot back,

776
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,600
于是就越界想...
and I went overboard to try and--

777
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,490
证明你比我强
Show me that you were better than me.

778
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,090
没错  结果我们两败俱伤
Yes, and I ended up blowing the deal for both of us,

779
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,140
对不起
And I'm sorry.

780
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,620
俗话说吃一堑长一智
Well, they say you learn from your mistakes.

781
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,640
没错
That's the thing.

782
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,100
我已经吸取教训了
I have already learned,

783
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,770
我认为我找到了双赢的办法
and I think that I have a way to get both of us a win.

784
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,540
格格丹  你们的大客户
Gigadyne. They're a major client at your firm.

785
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,270
不如你让他们来收购元桌面
What if you were to bring them the acquisition of Metadesk?

786
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,270
他们为什么要买
Why would they want this?

787
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,720
因为他们需要执行软件来
Because they need fulfillment software

788
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,630
提高他们在欧洲的销售量
to increase their sales in Europe,

789
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,920
而我们就是最佳选择
and we're a perfect fit.

790
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,770
你调查了我的客户
You researched my client?

791
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,850
我说过了  吃一堑  长一智
Like I said, I learn from my mistakes.

792
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,970
-你好啊  -少来这套
- Hey. - Oh, don't "Hey" Me.

793
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,310
你是无事不登三宝殿
You're up to something.

794
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,910
干嘛这么说
Why would you say that?

795
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,230
我为你工作了12年
I worked for you for 12 years.

796
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,120
你觉得我还分不出你有没有事吗
You think I can't tell when you're up to something?

797
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,620
-唐娜  -哈维
- Donna-- - Harvey,

798
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,650
既然你是来这里找的我
If you're coming to me in here,

799
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,370
那就说明你不想让路易知道
that means you don't want Louis to know.

800
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,630
可我已经不再为你工作了  我现在是他的人
And I don't work for you anymore--I work for him.

801
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,180
我知道  我也知道我将要问的事情
I know that, and I know what I'm about to ask

802
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,100
可能会置你于两难之地
might put you in between me and Louis.

803
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,190
但我希望你能帮我  看看我能做些什么
But I want you to help me figure out something I can do

804
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,650
阻止合伙人停我的职
that'll move the partners not to suspend me.

805
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,630
那就告诉我
Then tell me this.

806
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,390
那天路易跟你说了什么  居然能让你动手打他
What did Louis say to you that made you hit him?

807
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,980
为什么要问这个
Why are you asking me that?

808
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,180
因为你让我和你一伙
Because you're asking me to pick your side,

809
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,010
那我就要知道你是不是值得
and I need to know if you deserve it.

810
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,920
唐娜
Donna,

811
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,890
要是到现在了你都还不了解我
if you don't know me well enough to know

812
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,710
觉得我不值得你帮的话
that I deserve your help by now,

813
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,710
那我再说什么都是徒劳
nothing I tell you is gonna matter.

814
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,530
而无论我是否值得
But whether I deserve it or not,

815
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,710
我可以向你保证  路易会用阴招
I guarantee you Louis is going to have some dirty trick

816
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,520
为这次的投票做准备
up his sleeve for that vote.

817
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,490
路易  我有话跟你说
Louis, I need to talk to you for a second.

818
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,170
如果你是来劝我别玩阴的
Well, if you're here to tell me not to play dirty,

819
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,860
那就别白费口舌了  因为唐娜已经劝过了
you're wasting your breath because Donna already did it.

820
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,800
我不是来劝你的
I'm not here to do that,

821
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,360
因为你已经在玩阴的了
because you already played dirty.

822
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,570
我是来劝你给哈维停职投反对票的
I'm here to get you to vote against suspending Harvey.

823
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,650
什么叫我已经在玩阴的了
How the hell have I already played dirty?

824
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,800
你明知我的合伙人资格对哈维来说有特殊意义
You knew my partnership would mean something to Harvey,

825
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,020
可你非但没有让此事避免涉入你们的纠纷
and instead of holding it outside of your feud,

826
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,050
反而利用它把他骗回了律所
you used it to trick him back into the firm.

827
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,930
迈克  那是因为这是得到正义的唯一方式
Because, Mike, it was the only way to get justice.

828
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,240
好
Okay.

829
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,580
如果你是这么想的话  那换句
If you think that, then let me put this in terms

830
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,120
你能懂的话说  就是
that you might understand.

831
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,110
哈维是琼恩・雪诺  而我是他的班扬叔叔
Harvey is Jon Snow, I'm his Uncle Benjen,

832
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,180
你利用我把他引出来
and you used me to lure him out

833
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,210
这样大家就可以一人一刀把他捅死了
so that everybody could stab him to death.

834
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,380
你竟敢把哈维比做琼恩・雪诺
How dare you defile Game of Thrones

835
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,810
这绝对是对《权力的游戏》的玷污
by comparing Harvey to Jon Snow.

836
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,250
你明知道  这不是重点
That's not the point, and you know it.

837
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,900
重点是  你背叛了哈维
The point is, you betrayed Harvey,

838
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,170
就像那个小孩背叛琼恩・雪诺一样
the same way that kid betrayed Jon Snow.

839
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,880
话虽如此  可那是为了所有的守夜人
Well, in that case, it was for the good of the Watch.

840
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,280
是啊  我觉得那小孩肯定也是这么想的
Yeah, I'm sure that's what that kid thought, too.

841
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,400
但我向你保证  他之后的一生都会在
But I guarantee you, he's going to regret stabbing his friend

842
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,900
害过朋友的悔恨和痛苦中度过
for the rest of his miserable life.

843
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,810
{\an8}捷运快递服务

844
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,950
丹尼尔・哈德曼办公室
Daniel Hardman's office.

845
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,450
立刻让他听电话
I need to speak to him right now.

846
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,720
请问是哪位来电
Who may I say is calling?

847
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,670
你知道是谁  史黛西
You know who it is, Stacy.

848
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,420
快让他接电话
Now get him on the goddamn phone.

849
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,820
他现在不在  但他有给你留言
He's not here, but he left word for you.

850
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,400
他寄了两个包裹
He sent two packages.

851
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,740
要么你按照一个继续
Either move forward on one of them,

852
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,040
要么他按照另一个继续
Or he'll move forward on the other.

853
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,600
-祝贺你  -贺什么
- Congratulations. - On what?

854
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,900
祝贺你作为初级合伙人赢了第一个案子啊
On winning your first case as junior partner.

855
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,900
我赢了作为初级合伙人的第一个案子吗
I won my first case as junior partner?

856
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,970
你有了一个超棒的主意
Mm-hmm, turns out you had a brilliant idea.

857
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:12,840
真的吗  我想出了什么好主意
Oh, really? And what was my brilliant idea?

858
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,950
等我跟其他合伙人聊天时
You know, for when I'm sitting around

859
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,260
就可以好好吹一下了
shooting the shit with the other partners.

860
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,570
你让我回去找克莱尔
You sent me back to Claire

861
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,890
提议说让她自己的客户买下元桌面
to propose that she have one of her own clients buy Metadesk

862
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,970
让奥泰拉也加入进来
and let Optela stay on board.

863
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,920
瑞秋  这想法真是太棒了
Rachel, that's amazing.

864
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,870
我不敢相信她竟然真的同意了
I can't believe she went for it.

865
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,480
她同意了  格格丹也同意了
She went for it, and Gigadyne went for it.

866
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,730
你刚刚是说了格格丹吗
Did you just say Gigadyne?

867
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,410
是啊  怎么了
Yeah. Why?

868
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,840
瑞秋  格格丹刚公布了他们会
Rachel, Gigadyne just announced they're getting into

869
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,320
接手国防部外包业务
the Defense contracting business.

870
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,160
-什么  什么时候的事  -是的
- What? When? - Yeah.

871
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,710
昨天  他们已经签了第一份合同了
Yesterday--they already have their first contract.

872
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,390
就是说我刚刚让这项交易涉及到的每个人
Which means I just triggered a background check

873
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:42,020
都要接受背景调查
on every single person involved in this deal.

874
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,450
迈克  真对不起
Mike, I am so sorry.

875
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,100
不会  你也不知道会这样
No, you couldn't have known.

876
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,450
而且我们也没有时间说对不起
And we don't have time for "I'm sorrys" anyway.

877
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,990
在一切还来得及的时候
We have to find a way to take care of this

878
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:49,790
我们得赶紧想办法补救
before it's too late.

879
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,260
我们该怎么做
How are we gonna do that?

880
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,740
我们要大变活人
We're gonna hide in plain sight.

881
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,470
我不懂
I don't understand.

882
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,180
我们要把我的名字从所有的文件上删除
We're gonna take my name off all of the paperwork,

883
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,330
然后祈祷没人发现
and we're gonna hope to god nobody notices.

884
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,860
你在这里干嘛
What are you doing in here?

885
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,460
赶上我的工作进度啊
Catching up on my work.

886
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,230
-有问题吗  -没有
- Is that a problem? - No.

887
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,000
就是我跟你说过了
It's just that I told you

888
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,070
不用你再抄录这些了
that I didn't need you to do any transcribing.

889
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,770
你说话时的语气让我想起了
And the way you said it got me thinking

890
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,380
你有多喜欢把你的计划都录在里面
about how you like making your plans on this thing.

891
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,660
然后我就听到了这个
And then I came across this.

892
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,560
唐娜
Donna--

893
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,230
你觉得我对你敞开心扉
You think me opening up

894
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,700
告诉你我有恐慌症是在控制你吗
about having panic attacks is manipulation?

895
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,400
我都不觉得你真有恐慌症
I don't even think you really had panic attacks,

896
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,560
更别说去治疗了
let alone are going to therapy.

897
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,640
我有
Well, I am.

898
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,350
而我对你说出实情
And I opened up to you about it,

899
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,870
之后你却着我的眼睛
and then you looked me in the eye,

900
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,020
利用迈克的晋升会议引我回来
and you used Mike's partnership to lure me back.

901
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,320
是的
Yes.

902
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:44,910
是我做的
I did.

903
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,950
因为我想让你明白这种感受
Because I wanted you to know how it feels

904
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,510
当一个人当面承诺你一件事
when someone says one thing to your face

905
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,000
转身就做了
and then turns right around

906
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,220
完全相反的事  就像你对我做的
and does the exact opposite, like you did--

907
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,500
他把这些事情告诉了你
He revealed those things to you,

908
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,290
可是你却录下来  为了放给其他的合伙人听
and you recorded him so you could play it for the partners?

909
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,000
我不是想录他说的那些东西
I wasn't trying to record him saying those things.

910
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,490
我只是想拿到他打我的证据
I just wanted proof that he hit me.

911
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,780
胡说
Bullshit!

912
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,840
你根本不在乎你拿到的是什么
You didn't care what you got.

913
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,020
你只是想打倒他
You just wanted to get him.

914
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,940
你还真说对了
You're damn right I did.

915
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,190
他打了我
He hit me.

916
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,290
他抢走埃斯特
He got Esther.

917
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,740
他永远随心所欲
He gets away with everything.

918
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,200
也许是的
Maybe he does.

919
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,310
如果你想让他被停职
And if you want to try to get him suspended,

920
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,590
那是你的权利
that's your right.

921
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:26,130
但你利用他的弱点公开羞辱他
But if you use his weaknesses to publicly humiliate him,

922
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,780
我就不再为你工作了
I'm done working for you.

923
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,940
瑞秋
Rachel,

924
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,330
你在这里做什么
what are you doing here?

925
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,820
我们已经把所有合同发回去了
We already sent back all of the contracts.

926
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,870
我知道  我只是过来一下
I know, I just came by

927
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,770
你忘记最后一页的签名了
because you missed a signature on the last page.

928
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,870
不  我没忘
No, I didn't miss it.

929
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,780
-我只是想暂缓签署  -为什么
- I was holding off on signing it. - Why?

930
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,660
因为我在想你为什么做了
Because I was wondering why you made changes

931
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,190
七处不同的增补  却不告知我
to seven different addendums without redlining them for me.

932
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,400
那只是签署页几个合伙人名单
They're just signatory pages of a few lists of partners,

933
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,260
我不觉得有必要做告知
so I didn't think that that warranted a redline.

934
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,660
是你不觉得  还是你的合伙人不觉得
You didn't or your partner didn't?

935
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,800
我们都不觉得  他在国防部有个客户
Neither of us did. He has a big client in defense,

936
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,770
而且虽然我们不代理格格丹
and so even though we don't rep Gigadyne,

937
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,650
他也担心他们认为有利益冲突
he was worried they might see it as a conflict.

938
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,030
他担心的不是利益冲突
The reason he's worried is not because of a conflict.

939
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,320
是交易会引发背景审查
It's because this transaction triggers a background check.

940
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,620
-也就是说  -我告诉你原因了
- Which means-- - I told you the reason.

941
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,020
他在代理另一位客户  而且...
He's repping another client and--

942
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,790
他在骗你  瑞秋
He's lying to you, Rachel.

943
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,320
你会觉得这很难相信
You're gonna find this impossible to believe,

944
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,450
但迈克・罗斯是个骗子  他知道我知道这点
but Mike Ross is a fraud, and he knows that I know.

945
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,910
所以他最后一刻派你来了
That's why he sent you in at the last minute

946
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,340
可这明明从一开始就是他的交易
when this was his deal from day one.

947
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,140
你疯了吗  他是
Are you crazy? He's a partner

948
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,860
皮尔斯-斯派克特-利特律所的合伙人
at Pearson, Specter, Litt,

949
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,020
而你说你的迈克・罗斯不是45岁
and you said your Mike Ross wasn't 45.

950
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,380
所以我认识的迈克...
So the Mike that I know--

951
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,070
天呐  你知道
Oh, my god, you know.

952
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,430
我什么都不知道  除了我们需要...
I don't know anything, except that we just need--

953
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,630
你要不告诉我发生了什么
I'm calling the D.A.'s office right now if you don't tell me

954
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,030
我就给检察官办公室打电话
what the hell's going on.

955
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,470
我们订婚了
We're engaged.

956
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,430
所以确实是他
So it is him.

957
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,330
克莱尔  求你  你不能告发他
Claire, please, you can't turn him in.

958
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,610
这跟我不能怎么做无关
This isn't about what I can't do.

959
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,630
你发现了这事  怎么还能跟那样的人在一起
How could you be with a man like that after you found out?

960
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,520
因为我已经爱上他了
Because I already loved him.

961
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,440
抱歉了  瑞秋
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel.

962
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,910
我没法选另一条路
I just can't turn the other way.

963
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,530
你知道你纵容了什么吗
Don't you understand what this is condoning?

964
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,630
我明白
Yes, I understand what it's condoning,

965
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,520
但你设身处地为我想想
But you have to put yourself in my shoes.

966
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,370
想象你是在一年之后
Imagine you found out a year later,

967
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,170
已经了解了他的真实内心后才发现
after you already knew the kind of man he is inside.

968
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,360
克莱尔  我...
Look, Claire, I'm...

969
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,420
我跟你说
I'm telling you.

970
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,930
他确实不是律师
No, he's not a lawyer,

971
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,330
但他的确改变了他的生活
but he did turn his life around.

972
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,360
你是个聪明的姑娘  瑞秋
You're a smart woman, Rachel.

973
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,600
但你在犯一个天大的错误
But you are making a huge mistake.

974
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:52,310
求你了  求你了
Please, I am begging you.

975
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,880
完事了
It's done.

976
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,080
-她信了  -是的
- She bought it? - She did.

977
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,240
难以置信
I can't believe it.

978
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,410
你是觉得我搞不定吗
Did you think I couldn't handle it?

979
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,040
我猜我只是担心她总会想明白
I guess I was just worried that she'd figure it out anyway,

980
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,930
揭发我  然后...
expose me, and then--

981
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,700
没什么"然后"
There is no "And then."

982
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,420
因为根本没有发生
Because that didn't happen.

983
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,820
多亏了你
Because of you.

984
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,970
是多亏我们
Because of us.

985
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,140
你把戒指戴到办公室了
You're wearing your ring at the office.

986
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,150
是的
I am.

987
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,650
你为什么决定那么做了
What made you decide to do that?

988
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:00,130
我...只是发现了
I...I just realized

989
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,270
我有多爱你
how much I love you,

990
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,350
而且...
and...

991
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,090
也不想再藏着那份爱了
That's not something I ever want to hide.

992
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,800
瑞...
Ra--

993
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,280
杰西卡  我能跟你聊聊吗
Jessica, can I talk to you for a second?

994
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,630
什么事  路易  我正要下班回家
What is it, Louis? I'm heading home for the night.

995
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,890
我想取消投票
I want to call off the vote.

996
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,500
你说什么
Excuse me?

997
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,740
整件事都是错误
The whole thing was a mistake.

998
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,020
我想取消
I want to call it off.

999
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,250
路易  投票就在明早
Louis, the vote is tomorrow morning.

1000
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,730
唯一让它不发生的方法
The only way it doesn't happen

1001
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,000
就是你公开说明哈维没有打你
is if you publicly tell everyone that Harvey didn't hit you.

1002
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,680
我不能那么做  我会失去信誉
I can't do that. I'll lose all credibility.

1003
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,110
所以我才想让哈维休假两周
Which is exactly why I wanted Harvey to take two weeks.

1004
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,440
就是要让你冷静下来
To let you calm down.

1005
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,910
因为我知道你会改变主意
Because I knew you'd change your mind.

1006
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,700
如果你不介意的话
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1007
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,030
我还得准备投票
I have a vote to prepare for.

1008
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,970
稍等  如果我改变投票立场呢
Wait, what if I flip my vote?

1009
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,100
随你怎么改  路易
Flip whatever the hell you want, Louis.

1010
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,720
但这事是你挑起的
But you started this ball rolling,

1011
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,310
如今我们都得承担其结果
and now we all have to live with the consequences.

1012
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,900
你不是在故意躲着我吗
I thought you were trying to avoid me.

1013
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,960
之前是的
I was.

1014
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,990
但我又想到你总会知道是我的
But then I figured out you knew it was me anyway.

1015
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,070
怎么知道呢
How?

1016
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,240
重要吗
Does it matter?

1017
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,820
不重要
No, it doesn't.

1018
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,360
那你来做什么
So why are you here?

1019
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,410
我只想说谢谢你
I just wanted to say thank you.

1020
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,600
不客气
You're welcome.

1021
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:40,050
我还想知道你为什么愿意放过我
I also wanted to know why you're letting it go.

1022
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,710
因为瑞秋求我了
Because Rachel begged me to.

1023
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,590
因为她说她爱你
And because she said that she loved you

1024
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,320
而你改变了自己的生活
and that you turned your life around.

1025
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,300
你相信她
And you believed her?

1026
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,930
我相信她爱你
I believe that she loves you.

1027
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,520
但你要真想知道事实
But if you really want to know the truth,

1028
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,700
我不相信你能改变你的生活
no, I don't believe that you turned your life around,

1029
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,920
而且绝对不相信你爱他
and I definitely don't believe that you love her.

1030
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,380
什么  你怎么能这么说
What? How can you say that?

1031
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,960
因为你说服她相信一切都会没事
Because you've convinced her that it's all gonna be okay,

1032
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,730
你俩会从此幸福地生活在一起
that you two are just gonna get to live happily ever after,

1033
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,580
我不想做那个
and I didn't want to be the one

1034
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,960
毁掉一切的恶人
to make that all come crashing down.

1035
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,560
但你知道吗  迈克
But you know what, Mike?

1036
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,930
总有一天  这一切都会毁掉
One day, it is going to come crashing down.

1037
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,650
如果你真爱她
And if you really do love her,

1038
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,330
你会现在就停手
you'll put a stop to this right now.

1039
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,360
你觉得我不该再做律师
So, you think I should stop being a lawyer?

1040
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,200
我是说你要真爱她  就不会跟她结婚
I'm saying if you really love her, you won't marry her.
