00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,430
{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,900
什么叫你不能接这个案子
What do you mean you can't take the case?

16
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,930
杰西卡不会为工时花钱
Jessica won't lay out the money for the man-hours.

17
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,940
我叔叔基思也是受害者之一
One of the victims was my uncle Keith.

18
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,090
求你了  这些人需要你的帮助
Please. These people need your help.

19
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,910
我没有主动站出来  是他们找到我的
I didn't come forward. They found me.

20
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,520
而且新人的事也不是我搞的
And I'm not pulling any associate shit.

21
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,020
那你怎么解释这份
Then what do you call

22
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,580
候选人名单
this pathetic excuse of a candidates list?

23
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,250
我觉得这是自然而然的  因为我们的学生识字
I call it inevitable, because our students can read.

24
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,980
我们的未来要溜走了  而给杰克命名合伙人地位
Our future is slipping away, and offering Jack

25
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,560
或是跟上帝祈祷哈维
name partner or praying to god that Harvey

26
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,040
能把迈克的案子摆平
just gets Mike off the hook

27
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,810
都没法阻止这事发生
Isn't gonna stop it from happening.

28
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,170
字幕
Then you get your ass back up to Harvard,

29
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,560
你现在就滚去哈佛  确保希拉不会出现在庭审上
And you make sure sheila doesn't show up to that trial.

30
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,680
这是去阿根廷的机票
It's a ticket to Argentina.

31
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,410
我需要你去那儿待到审判结束
I need you to go there until the trial's over.

32
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,750
法庭不听这些废话  那里讲事实
Court's not about bullshit like this; it's about facts.

33
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,760
事实是  你不是律师
And the fact is, you're not a goddamn lawyer.

34
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,100
你是在说我觉得你在说的话吗
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

35
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,820
你要那么想  那你就是蠢货
Because if you're thinking it, you're a fool.

36
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,530
你听到了
You heard her.

37
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,890
她说"事实就是我不是律师"
She said "the fact is, is that I'm not a goddamn lawyer".

38
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,150
那唯一改变那个事实的办法就是
Well, the only way to change that fact

39
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,110
让陪审团看到我是个律师
is for a jury to see me be a goddamn lawyer.

40
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,630
你要那么做  他们看到的就只是
You try that, all they're gonna see

41
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,760
该进监狱的某人
is someone going to prison.

42
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,260
这是我的决定  我要做
It's my call, and I'm making it.

43
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,310
我们有麻烦了  他们找到了特雷弗
We have a problem. They found Trevor.

44
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,680
请举起你的右手
Please raise your right hand.

45
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,490
你愿意发誓
Do you swear to tell the truth,

46
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,240
所言句句属实
the whole truth,

47
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,360
毫不欺瞒
and nothing but the truth,

48
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,070
上帝为证吗
so help you God?

49
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,500
我愿意
I do.

50
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,570
你可以坐下了
You may be seated.

51
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,060
埃文斯先生  你认识罗斯先生多久了
Mr. Evans, how long have you known Mr. Ross?

52
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,070
我们从小就认识  快二十年了
Since we were kids. Almost 20 years.

53
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,450
那你们很亲近吧
So you were close to him?

54
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,930
对  他曾是我最好的朋友
Yeah, he was my best friend.

55
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,250
你现在还跟他很亲近吗
Are you still close to him?

56
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,050
我想在这之后就不会了
Well, I doubt we will be after this.

57
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,570
在什么之后
After what?

58
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,410
在你问我一系列
After you ask me about the series of events

59
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,190
我们今天为之而来的问题之后
that have led us all to be here today.

60
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,720
我们等一下再聊你们之间的历史
Well, we'll get to your history in a minute,

61
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,720
但首先  我想问你一个关于近期事件的问题
But first, I want to ask you a question about current events.

62
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,580
迈克・罗斯有没有在三天前找到你
Did Mike Ross approach you three days ago

63
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,830
企图让你不要上庭指证他
in an attempt to get you not to testify against him?

64
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,810
是的  他来找过我
Yes, he did.

65
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,040
那次对话具体是如何进行的
How exactly did that conversation go?

66
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,880
-你在这里干嘛  -你知道我在这里干嘛
- What are you doing here? - You know exactly what I'm doing here.

67
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,230
你说过你不会出庭作证的
You said you would not testify.

68
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,060
对  但那是在安妮塔・吉布斯把我抓走
Yeah, well, that was before Anita Gibbs dragged me in

69
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,390
告诉我她要把我关十年之前
and told me she was gonna put me away for ten years.

70
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,980
我不在乎她跟你说了什么
I don't give a shit what she told you.

71
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,180
你说过你会叫律师的
You said you were gonna call a lawyer.

72
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,800
对  但我还没机会叫
Yeah, well, before I had a chance to do that,

73
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,270
他们给我看了他们手上的东西
they showed me what they had,

74
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,190
有姓名  日期  证人  以及所有
which is names, dates, witnesses, and everything else

75
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,730
他们需要能把我爱关多久就关多久的东西
they need to put me away for as long as they want.

76
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,090
等等  等等  他们怎么会有
Wait, wait, how would they have--

77
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,270
你以为我愿意这么做吗
You think I want to do this?

78
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,640
我不想的
I don't.

79
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,540
但是我不能为了你冒坐牢的风险
But I cannot risk prison for you.

80
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,430
我向你保证  无论他们掌握了什么
And I am telling you that whatever they have,

81
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,580
哈维都可以为你脱罪的
Harvey can get you out of this.

82
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,840
吉布斯也跟我说了
And from what she told me,

83
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,420
她可以让你脱罪
Gibbs can get you out of this.

84
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,920
她愿意跟你交易  可以让这一切结束
She offered you a deal that can make this whole thing stop.

85
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,320
与其让我不要出庭指证你
Now, instead of telling me not to testify against you,

86
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,360
你为什么不考虑一下指证哈维呢
why don't you think about testifying against Harvey?

87
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,350
因为我不像你  我绝不会背叛朋友
Because unlike you, I would never do that to a friend!

88
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,270
对  但我跟你不一样的是
Yeah, well, unlike you, when they put me away,

89
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,280
他们可不会把我关进白领监狱
I'm not going to a white-collar prison.

90
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,130
所以如果我不出庭作证毁了你
So if I don't rip you to shreds up there on the stand,

91
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,340
他们就会在监狱里毁了我
they're gonna rip me to shreds behind bars.

92
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,500
哈维  很晚了  我今天很累
Harvey, it's late. I've had a long day.

93
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,420
所以如果你不介意的话
So if you don't mind...

94
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,750
我们有麻烦了
We have a problem.

95
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,550
又怎么了  我家着火了吗
What now? My condo's on fire?

96
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,300
迈克想自己辩护
Mike wants to represent himself.

97
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,540
他疯了吗  他不能那样做
Is he crazy? He can't do that.

98
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,830
我也尝试过告诉他这个
That's what I tried to tell him.

99
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,490
你不该尝试  你应该直接命令他
You don't try; you just tell him.

100
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,070
对  但唯一的问题在于
Yeah, the only problem with that is,

101
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,460
他知道这是他自己的决定
he knows it's his decision.

102
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,410
更别提他没有去找吉布斯
not to mention, the only thing that's stopping him

103
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,370
指证你或者我的唯一原因
from going to Gibbs and pointing his finger

104
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,650
就是他对我们的忠诚
at you or me is his loyalty to us.

105
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,740
那就这么算了吗
So that's it?

106
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,470
就让他为自己辩护
He's representing himself?

107
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,400
我没有这么说
I'm not saying that.

108
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,410
那你到底想说什么
Then what exactly are you saying?

109
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,320
我是说我有个计划
I'm saying I have a plan,

110
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,220
但我需要你的同意
but I need you to sign off on it.

111
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,100
不管是什么计划  我都同意
Oh, whatever it is, I'm in.

112
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,250
因为如果那孩子自己辩护
Because if that kid handles his own defense,

113
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,570
那接下来就是你和我上庭受审了
you and I are going to be the next ones on trial.

114
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,050
如果你来是想知道特雷弗会不会作证  他会
If you're here to find out if Trevor's testifying, he is.

115
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,350
我可以搞定特雷弗
I can handle Trevor.

116
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,750
哈维  我们谈过这个了
Harvey, we've been over this.

117
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,710
我也说过我不会善罢甘休的
And I said we're not done being over it.

118
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,400
我知道老话说自己辩护的律师都是傻瓜
Listen to me, I know that fool-for-a-client bullshit.

119
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,650
但现在他们指控说我不是个律师
But the thing I'm being accused of is not being a lawyer.

120
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,180
所以如果我为自己辩护  那我在庭上的每一秒
So if I represent myself, every second I'm up there,

121
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,430
他们都会看到我就是个律师
they're gonna see me as a lawyer.

122
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,510
但如果她在其中任何一刻打乱你的阵脚
And if she rattles you for one of those goddamn seconds,

123
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,130
他们就会认为你是个骗子
they're gonna see you as a fraud, and they're never

124
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,060
并且再也不会看到你的其他方面
gonna see you as anything else.

125
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,130
好了
Okay.

126
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,850
我知道了  你表达了你的意见
I got it. You said your piece.

127
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,160
这是我的决定  我不想再讨论了
It's my call. I'm done talking about it.

128
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,650
那我们就进行一次模拟庭审来帮你做准备
Then we'll do a trial run to get you ready.

129
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,670
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

130
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,150
你想浪费我的时间  更别说
You want to waste my time, not to mention

131
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,100
把我们的丑事  向整个公司直播
air our dirty laundry, in front of the whole firm?

132
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,240
迈克  十天之内  我们的丑事
Mike, in a week and a half, our dirty laundry is gonna be

133
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,830
将向全世界直播
aired in front of the whole world.

134
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,670
而且吉布斯会用
And Gibbs is gonna come at you in ways

135
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,110
你意想不到的方式来对付你
you've never even thought about.

136
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,590
我明白了  你不是用模拟庭审来帮我准备
Oh, so I get it. You don't want a trial run to get me ready;

137
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,580
你想用模拟庭审来证明我不是她的对手
you want a trial run to show me that I'm outmatched.

138
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,650
你不是我和吉布斯的对手
You are outmatched by me and Gibbs,

139
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,540
而你害怕承认这个事实
And you're afraid to find out.

140
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,250
我不怕吉布斯  我也不怕你
I'm not afraid of Gibbs, and I am not afraid of you.

141
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,290
那你就不会介意同意  如果我赢了你
Then you won't mind agreeing, if I beat you,

142
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,240
你就让我上庭为你辩护
you let me represent you in court.

143
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,480
好  哈维  你想比一场
Okay, Harvey, you want to go?

144
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,700
那我们就比一场
Let's go.

145
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,440
不过你最好使出浑身解数
But you better bring your A game.

146
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,540
因为你或许确实是全城最好的律师
Because you might be the best closer in the city,

147
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,240
但我是背水一战
But I'm the one fighting for my life.

148
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,920
{\an8}诉讼双雄

149
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,050
谢谢
Thank you.

150

找到你了
There he is.

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,170
哈罗德
Harold.

152
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,580
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

153
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,300
我知道发生了什么事  好吗
I know what's going on, okay?

154
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,710
我知道你要面临的庭审
I know about the trial coming up.

155
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,120
那你肯定知道我现在很忙
Then you know I'm pretty busy right now.

156
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,470
对  这也是我找你的原因
Right, which is why I wanted to talk to you.

157
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,310
听着  你会需要有人为你作证
Listen, you're gonna need someone to testify

158
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,570
证明你念过哈佛
that you went to Harvard.

159
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,270
我想为你作证
I want to be that guy.

160
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,910
哈罗德  你的提议很棒  但是
Harold, that's an amazing offer, but--

161
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,750
迈克  拜托  伙计
Mike, come on, man.

162
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,840
我们都知道你没有念过哈佛
We both know that you didn't go to Harvard.

163
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,990
但说实话  如果任何人问过我
But honestly, if anyone would have asked me up until this point,

164
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,900
我都会发誓说你念过
I would have sworn that you did.

165
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,110
我会发誓我看到你出现在
I would have sworn that I saw you

166
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,060
在吉尔克斯的派对上
at that--that party with Gilcrest

167
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,690
或在匹诺曹餐厅吃披萨
or those pizza nights at Pinocchio's

168
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,370
或者在任何一段我当时的记忆里
or pretty much any other memory I have of that time,

169
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,610
也就是说  如果他们让我出庭作证
which means, if they put me up there on that stand,

170
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,590
我基本上是在说实话
I'd basically be telling the truth.

171
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,360
我无法形容这对我多重要  哈罗德  但
I can't tell you how much that means to me, Harold, but...

172
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,520
迈克  我想为你这么做  拜托了
Mike, I want to do this for you, please.

173
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,790
我知道你想
I know you do.

174
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,970
但是我把自己弄到这步田地
But I got myself into this mess,

175
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,590
我得靠自己爬起来
and I got to get myself out of it.

176
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,480
好吧
Okay.

177
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,230
但是  如果你改变主意
But listen, if you change your mind,

178
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,140
你知道应该去哪找我
you know where to find me.

179
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,710
陪审团的女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

180
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,980
你们将在接下来几天
you're gonna be hearing a lot of things

181
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,360
听到很多东西
over the next several days,

182
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,390
但事实上  这个案子
but the truth is, this case is about

183
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,120
证据只有确凿的  无法动摇的
nothing more than cold, hard--

184
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,310
捕风捉影
Innuendo.

185
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,310
而事实是  我可以背诵
And the fact is, I'm capable of reciting every element

186
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,400
纽约州所有的法理学要素
of jurisprudence in the State of New York.

187
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,580
尽管如此  控方将会
and yet despite that, the prosecution is gonna

188
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,450
企图让你们相信我是个
try to convince you that I am a--

189
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,030
骗子  一个没有通过律师考试  也没读过
Fraud, who not only didn't pass the bar or go

190
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,500
法学院的人  他连大学都没毕业
to law school, he didn't even graduate college.

191
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,130
没有任何确凿的证据
There isn't one piece of hard evidence

192
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,780
能证明我没有读过哈佛法学院
proving that I didn't go to Harvard Law.

193
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,700
没有交学费的记录
There's no record of tuition being paid.

194
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,560
没有波士顿地址的记录
No record of a Boston address.

195
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,770
年册里甚至没有一张你的照片
There isn't even a simple picture in the yearbook.

196
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,710
那我们就来聊聊年册
Let's talk about the yearbook.

197
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,800
就像他说的  我没有出现在年册中
As he told you, I'm not in the yearbook.

198
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,240
迈克・罗斯在哪里
Where is Mike Ross?

199
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,390
但他没有告诉你们的是
Though what he didn't tell you is that

200
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,750
还有25个人也没有出现在年册中
25 other students are also not in this yearbook.

201
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,500
那些人有以诈骗罪名被起诉吗
Are those other students being charged with fraud?

202
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,370
当然没有  因为我们不会因为
Of course not, because we don't put people on trial

203
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,240
照相日请病假而被起诉  不论
for being sick on picture day, and no matter--

204
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,890
他怎么说  事实是  迈克・罗斯不是律师
What he says, the fact is, Mike Ross is not a lawyer.

205
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,010
他是个诈骗犯
He's a fraud.

206
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,700
而我们会将此事证明得确凿无疑
And we will prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt.

207
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,390
辩方想传唤第一位证人
The defense would like to call its first witness.

208
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,300
你们看  他多不像个律师
Right there-- he's such a non-lawyer,

209
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,440
他甚至不知道应该是检方先传唤证人
he doesn't even know the prosecution goes first.

210
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,530
那你显然也不知道
And you obviously don't know

211
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,160
1937年贾维斯诉纽约州案
Jarvis V. the State of New York, 1937,

212
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,530
庭审一旦开始
when calling of the first witness

213
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,500
传唤第一位证人的时机
is of such special nature as to disrupt

214
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,230
就是影响庭审连贯性的本质因素
the flow of the trial once it's started.

215
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,330
你说什么本质上呢
What the hell special nature are you talking about?

216
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,960
当辩方的第一位证人
When the defense wants to call the prosecutor

217
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,290
就是该案的检察官时
as its first witness.

218
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,770
哈维  除非你有其他理由推翻这个请求
Harvey, unless you have something to overturn this,

219
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,410
不然请就坐吧
I'm gonna need you to have a seat.

220
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,140
斯佩克特先生  你说我没有
Mr. Specter, you said there's no record of me

221
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,010
在波士顿拥有公寓的证明
ever having an apartment in Boston.

222
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,130
那你能解释一下为什么
Can you explain to the jury why there's no record

223
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,520
你没有住在那里的证明吗
of you ever having lived there?

224
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,880
又不是我受审
I'm not the one on trial here.

225
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,500
确实不是你
No, you're not.

226
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,420
但你坐在证人席上
You're the one in that chair,

227
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,180
还是要请你回答我的问题
so why don't you answer the question,

228
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,730
或者我们就此停止吧
or we can stop this whole thing right now.

229
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,510
我没有住在那里的证明是因为
There's no record of me living there

230
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,390
我在这里有住所所以在那里是跟人分租的
because I sublet up there when I had my place down here.

231
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,290
所以某个人
So it is possible

232
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,440
没有波士顿的住址
that a person not have a Boston address

233
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,510
也不一定意味着他没有在哈佛学习
without it meaning that they didn't attend Harvard.

234
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,680
非常好  谢谢你
Great. Thank you so much.

235
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,250
我问完了
This witness is excused.

236
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,150
那你在那里没有住址
And what, exactly, is your reason

237
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,790
又是什么原因呢
for not having an address up there?

238
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,310
除非你不敢回答我的问题
Unless you're too afraid to answer my questions.

239
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,220
不  我一点也不害怕
No, I'm not afraid of you at all.

240
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,270
我的原因是我选择和我的朋友
My reason is that I chose to live with my friend

241
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,890
特雷弗住在一起
Trevor during that time.

242
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,370
这个说法的唯一问题是
The only problem with that is,

243
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,260
你的朋友特雷弗这辈子都住在布鲁克林区
your friend Trevor has lived in Brooklyn his entire life.

244
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,540
开车三个小时二十分就可以到哈佛
Exactly a 3 hour and 20 minute drive from Harvard.

245
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,190
所以你每天都那样开车往返吗
So you're saying you made that drive every day?

246
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,760
不  我只去参加考试
No, I only went up for tests

247
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,440
因为那样就够了
because that's all I had to do.

248
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,790
看来你还需要一些额外的教导吧
I guess you needed some extra tutoring, huh?

249
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,500
你期望这些人相信你可以
You expect these people to believe that you graduated

250
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,600
一次课都不上还能从全球竞争
from the most competitive law school in the world

251
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,050
最激烈的法学院毕业
without ever going to class?

252
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,320
你看这多可笑  因为你竟然
See, that's funny, because you actually

253
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,550
期待这些人相信
expect these people to believe

254
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,130
我从来没有读过法学院
that I never went to law school at all

255
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,930
但还能不知怎么地
and yet still somehow managed to convince

256
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,790
说服全世界最顶尖的律师们
the smartest lawyers in the world

257
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,850
让我当上了他们最年轻的合伙人
to make me their youngest partner ever.

258
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,060
现在谁的说法看起来更不可信呢
Whose story is looking more far-fetched now?

259
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,080
不回答  很好
Oh, no answer? Great.

260
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,240
我没有问题了  法官大人
No more questions, Your Honor.

261
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,860
我不知道你有没有注意到
I don't know if you've noticed this or not,

262
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,390
但他把你打得屁滚尿流
but he's kicking your ass.

263
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,540
那我就准备回击了
And I'm about to kick back.

264
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,570
你们两个在商量什么
Are you two discussing something

265
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,990
辩方需要知晓的内容吗
that defense should be made aware of?

266
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,060
就是讨论一下体育问题
Just talking about the Knicks.

267
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,580
检方准备好传唤第一位证人了吗
Now is the prosecution ready to call their first witness?

268
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,420
检方的第一位证人是这份
The prosecution's first witness is this affidavit

269
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,720
来自辩方理论上应在班级每位成员的
from every single member of the defendant's

270
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,080
一份宣誓证词
supposed graduating class.

271
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,790
反对  法官大人  我没有看过这份材料
Objection, Your Honor. I haven't seen that.

272
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,280
那我念给你听
Well, then let me read it to you.

273
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,840
我们一起站出来承诺
"We collectively come forward to swear

274
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,430
以下关于迈克尔・詹姆斯・罗斯的信息
the following regarding Michael James Ross:

275
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,910
我们从没见过他  也不认识他
We never saw him. We never knew him.

276
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,830
从没听说过他
We never heard of him.

277
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,020
对于他置哈佛法学院的名声于不顾的行为
And it makes us sick that he's taking the good name

278
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,400
我们也感到异常反感
of Harvard Law School and throwing it down the toilet.

279
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,430
请对所有指控判定有罪
Please find him guilty on all counts."

280
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,590
法官大人  我请求对这份文件立即予以废止
Your honor, I move to strike that document right now.

281
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,100
你的理由是什么
On what grounds?

282
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,690
理由是这是一份伪造的文件
On the grounds that it's completely fabricated.

283
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,430
你的证据呢
Where's your proof?

284
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,390
我们先不谈我确实在哈佛就读过这个事实
Besides the fact that I actually went to Harvard,

285
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,880
你根本不可能从昨晚到现在
there's no way you could have contacted

286
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,400
联系到全部的人
all of those people since last night.

287
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,560
那我建议你联系他们所有人
Then I suggest you call every one of these people

288
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,990
让他们来出庭作证
and put them on the stand.

289
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,900
但当你那么做的时候  他们每个人
But when you do, every single one of them is gonna

290
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,600
都会看着你的眼睛问  "你是谁啊"
look you in the eye and say, "Who the hell are you?"

291
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,190
怎么了  怎么不出声了
What? No snappy comeback?

292
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,910
你可以尽你所能愚弄这些人
You can try to trick these people all you want.

293
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,510
但事实就是你没有读过哈佛
But the fact is, you didn't go to Harvard,

294
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,840
这也证明了这件事
and this proves it.

295
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,070
反对  他在作证
Objection. He's testifying.

296
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,510
我只是在赢而已
What I'm doing is winning.

297
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,940
好了  够了
All right, that's enough.

298
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,400
我认为我们该休息一下了
I think this is a good time to take a break.

299
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,010
路易・利特
Louis Litt.

300
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,410
我是安妮塔・吉布斯
I'm Anita Gibbs.

301
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,580
我知道你是谁
Yeah, I know who you are.

302
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,980
问题是你在这里干什么
Question is, what are you doing here?

303
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,510
答案是  你说什么我也不在乎
And the answer is, I don't give a shit.

304
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,710
我是来夸奖你
I came here to compliment you

305
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,490
摆脱希拉・赛斯的方式的
on getting rid of Sheila Sazs.

306
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,010
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

307
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,830
真的吗  你以为我不知道发生了什么吗
Really? You think I don't know what's going on here?

308
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,910
你们两个曾经交往过  但当你发现
You two were in a relationship, and when you found out

309
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,570
是她写的那封邮件时
that it was her that wrote that email,

310
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,780
你去了剑桥说服她
you went up to Cambridge and convinced her to go to

311
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,960
在庭审期间去了阿根廷
Argentina for the duration of the trial.

312
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,120
你简直是疯了
You're out of your mind.

313
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,910
是吗
Am I?

314
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,420
你过去两周飞去波士顿三次
You flew to Boston three times in the last two weeks.

315
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,790
你搭车去过两次她家
You took two cabs to her house

316
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,930
还有一次离招生办公室100英尺都不到
and another to within 100 feet of the admissions office.

317
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,920
你没有任何证据
You have no proof of anything.

318
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,650
我不需要证据
I don't need proof.

319
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,150
因为尽管她现在在阿根廷
Because while she may be in Argentina now,

320
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,070
但她不会永远呆在那里
she's not gonna stay there forever,

321
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,690
也就是说等她回来的时候
which means when she gets back,

322
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,110
我就能证明你在骚扰证人
I get you for witness tampering.

323
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,370
拜托你离我远点
Do me a favor and leave me the hell alone.

324
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,520
我会的
I will.

325
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,890
暂时而已
For now.

326
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,680
如果她在庭审前没有回来
But if she's not back by the start of trial,

327
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,060
我会认为你想被起诉
I'm gonna assume that you want to be brought up on charges.

328
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,510
你这个混蛋  这不是真的
You son of a bitch. This isn't real.

329
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,330
我不在乎那是不是真的
I don't give a shit whether it's real or not.

330
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,000
你认为吉布斯不会那么做吗
You think Gibbs isn't gonna do things like that?

331
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,200
但她不会作伪证的  你也知道
She is not gonna enter false evidence, and you know it.

332
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,950
但她会为你设下陷阱
But she is gonna set up traps for you

333
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,180
就像我刚才那样
to bungle into like I just did.

334
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,010
那是胡说八道
This is such bullshit.

335
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,160
你生气是因为你输得很惨
You are just pissed because I was kicking your ass

336
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,350
然后你就想作弊
so now you're cheating.

337
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,890
我
Me?

338
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,210
是你想抓住一切机会
You're the one who testified in your

339
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,390
进行公开陈述
opening statement and every chance you get.

340
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,520
因为那是为自己辩护所必须的结果
Because that's exactly what me being my own lawyer gives us.

341
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,500
我不在乎
I don't care.

342
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,600
假如我代理你  结果需要你作证
If I represent you and it turns out that you need to testify,

343
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,870
我们可以传唤你上证人席
we can call you up to the stand.

344
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,000
假如我们那样做了
And if we do that,

345
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,820
那吉布斯就可以盘问我
then Gibbs gets to cross-examine me

346
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,980
并且让我看起来像个骗子
and make me look like a liar.

347
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,400
我不知道你注意到没有
Well, I don't know if you've noticed,

348
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,990
你看起来已经像个骗子了
but you're looking like a liar right now.

349
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,360
而我在试图让你看起来不像个傻瓜
And I'm trying to keep you from looking like a fool.

350
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,680
知道吗  我有点烦你不断喊我傻瓜了
You know what? I'm getting pretty tired of you using that word with me.

351
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,750
那太糟了  因为尽管你说了那一大通话
Too bad, because for all your bullshit up there,

352
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,780
你仍然无法提供一个记得你上过哈佛的人
you still can't produce one person who remembers you from Harvard.

353
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,620
所以假如你想有机会代理你自己
So if you want to have a chance at representing yourself,

354
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,860
那就快从我面前滚开  去想你的辩护词
get out of my face and go work on your defense

355
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,080
因为我的后招还有很多
'cause I got a lot more where that came from.

356
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,050
有什么我能为你效劳  路易
What can I do for you, Louis?

357
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,960
-吉布斯知道我的所作所为了  -什么
- Gibbs knows what I did. - What?

358
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,330
她知道我让希拉出了国
She knows I got Sheila out of the country.

359
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,540
她今早在门口等着我
She was waiting for me this morning,

360
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,990
并且威胁要起诉我
and she threatened to bring charges against me.

361
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,140
-你承认了吗  -没有
- Did you admit that to her? - No.

362
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,930
那她就无法起诉你任何事
Then she's not gonna charge you with anything.

363
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,350
你听见我刚刚说的了吗
Did you hear what I just said?

364
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,700
她知道了我在希拉去阿根廷的那晚
She knows I went to Sheila's place

365
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,280
去了她家
the same night she went to Argentina.

366
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,360
那又能证明什么
And what does that prove?

367
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,270
这证明了我有意
It proves that I knowingly

368
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,820
在一场调查正在进行中时
bought a witness a ticket out of the country

369
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,380
给一名证人买了张出国机票
in the middle of an ongoing investigation.

370
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,860
那一切只能证明  你奖励了一位
All it proves is, you rewarded a Harvard employee

371
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,620
在过去十年中一直向这家律所输送律师的
who's been steering lawyers towards this firm

372
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,660
哈佛职员
for the last ten years.

373
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,490
杰西卡  吉布斯可以轻易到阿根廷去
Okay, Jessica, Gibbs can easily go down to Argentina

374
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,150
然后问希拉
and ask Sheila--

375
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,020
路易  听听你自己说的话
Louis, listen to yourself.

376
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,620
她不会那样做的
She's not going to do that.

377
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,730
而且就算她那样做了
And even if she did,

378
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,440
在证人没有被传唤的情况下
it's not witness tampering

379
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,870
那也不算干扰证人
if a subpoena was never issued.

380
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,690
那吉布斯就会说我知道
Then Gibbs is gonna say that I had knowledge

381
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,110
有张即将到来的传票  因此就是干扰
of an impending subpoena; therefore it is tampering.

382
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,290
你知道吗  路易
You know what, Louis?

383
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,730
我一点都不在乎吉布斯怎么说
I don't give a shit what Gibbs says.

384
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,360
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

385
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,770
让那个女人自食她所造的苦果
Give that woman a taste of her own goddamn medicine.

386
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,810
你要去哪里
Where the hell are you going?

387
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,660
我们套住迈克了
We've got Mike on the ropes;

388
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,690
我们得让他别插手这事
we have to put him away.

389
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,530
抱歉  哈维
Sorry, Harvey.

390
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,960
刚刚出现了件更紧急的事
Something more pressing just came up.

391
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,420
还能有什么比这更紧急
What the hell could be more pressing than this?

392
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,670
你操心你自己的事  让我自己操心我的
You worry about your shit, and I'll worry about mine.

393
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,760
我已经把我的事搞定了
Oh, I've got my shit taken care of.

394
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,550
也许你搞定了  也许你没搞定
Well, maybe you do, and maybe you don't.

395
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,350
反正我近来学到的是
But what I've learned from recent history is,

396
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,960
假如你真的是安妮塔・吉布斯
if you really were Anita Gibbs,

397
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,760
不管你计划了什么
no matter what you had planned,

398
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,510
你其实都是另有打算
you'd be planning something else.

399
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,190
唐娜  拜托  现在不是时候
Donna, please, not right now.

400
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,110
我忙死了
I'm so busy.

401
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,740
没关系
That's fine.

402
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,870
我只是过来告诉你一声
I just came by to let you know that

403
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,830
杰西卡得出趟门
Jessica had to go out,

404
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,380
所以今天不继续举行模拟庭审了
so the trial is done for the rest of the day.

405
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,380
而哈维不打算告诉我
And Harvey wasn't gonna tell me

406
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,470
因为他在玩阴的
because he's playing dirty.

407
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,130
他不是你的敌人  迈克
He's not your enemy, Mike.

408
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,940
他只是在做他认为最好的
He's just doing what he thinks is best.

409
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,140
那我要做我认为最好的
Then I'm gonna do what I think is best.

410
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,500
那你认为怎么最好
And what exactly is that?

411
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,100
听着  唐娜  他或许不是我的敌人
Look, Donna, he may not be my enemy,

412
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,790
你或许也不是我的敌人
and you may not be my enemy,

413
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,480
但只要我们在模拟庭审中
but as long as we're in this trial run,

414
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,070
我是绝对不会信任你的
I'm not trusting you with anything.

415
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,310
果然是好孩子
That's my boy.

416
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,220
杰西卡・皮尔逊
Jessica Pearson,

417
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,040
我不知道我们今天约了见面
I wasn't aware we had an appointment today.

418
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,790
我们没约
We don't.

419
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,730
我只是过来给你这个限制令
I just stopped by to give you this restraining order,

420
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,680
阻止你在路易・利特的律师不在场的情况下
preventing you from contacting Louis Litt

421
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,990
接触他
without his attorney present.

422
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,330
让我猜猜...他的律师是你
And let me guess-- his attorney is you.

423
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,860
猜对了
Bingo.

424
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,830
所以除非你要逮捕他
So unless you're going to arrest him,

425
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,780
否则哪怕你只是发发短信  只要我不在场
you so much as text him without me present,

426
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,960
你也是违反了法院命令
and you're in violation of a court order.

427
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,330
你休想再继续挑拨我和我的人了
You're done driving a wedge between me and my people.

428
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,730
当我把你手下所有人一个个拉上证人席
We'll see how strong your bond is with your people

429
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,750
并直截了当地问他们
when I parade every one of them on the stand

430
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,160
"你知道迈克・罗斯是个骗子吗"
and ask them point-blank,

431
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,460
我们就能看到你和你的人联系是有多紧密了
"Did you know Mike Ross was a fraud?"

432
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,360
你觉得我们对那个问题会有不同的答案吗
You think we're gonna have different answers to that?

433
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,830
不  我觉得你们都会引用第五修正案
No, I think you're all gonna take the Fifth.

434
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,580
然后你们会自我安慰那样并不会显得心虚
And you're gonna tell yourselves it implies no guilt,

435
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,580
但在陪审团的眼里
but in the eyes of the jury,

436
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,020
你们可都相当于站在那里说出他的确有罪了
you might as well all just stand up there and say he did it.

437
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,620
所以你告诉你的客户我暂时不会找他麻烦了
So you tell your client he's off the hook for now.

438
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,690
但下次我再找他谈
But the next time I talk to him,

439
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,290
将会是他站在证人席上时
it will be on the stand.

440
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,260
我收到你的信息了
Hey, I got your message.

441
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,040
所以我来了
So here I am.

442
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,370
但我就直说了  迈克
But let me tell you something, Mike,

443
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,600
假如你的来意和我想象中的一样
if you're here to ask what I think you're gonna ask,

444
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,510
那我俩没啥好谈的
gonna be a short conversation.

445
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,660
我需要你说你记得我上过哈佛
I need you to say you remember me from Harvard.

446
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,360
只有一个小问题  迈克
There's just one small problem, Mike.

447
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,190
我不记得你
I don't remember you.

448
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,190
因为你没上过哈佛  不是吗
'Cause you didn't go there, did you?

449
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,280
看着我的眼睛  告诉我我说错了
Look me in the eye and tell me that I'm wrong.

450
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,330
该死的  迈克  我就知道
God damn you, Mike. I--I knew it.

451
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,050
吉米  吉米
Jimmy--Jimmy!

452
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,960
在我们刚开始工作时
When we first started,

453
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,580
你求我帮你保住你的饭碗
you begged me to help you save your career.

454
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,490
不不不不  迈克  这两件事可不一样
No, no, no, no, Mike. This is not the same thing.

455
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,060
我本可以让你丢掉律师资格的
I-I could have gotten you disbarred.

456
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,270
但那不会让我进监狱  而你清楚这一点
But it couldn't have got me sent to jail, and you know it.

457
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,340
我不在乎
I don't care! All right?

458
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,640
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

459
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,870
迈克  你在要求我作伪证
Mike, you are asking me to perjure myself,

460
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,210
而我甚至不了解你到底是个怎样的人
and I don't even know who you are.

461
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:35,740
不  你了解
Yes, you do.

462
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,510
我就是在你婶婶需要帮助时你求助的那个人
I am the same guy you came to when your aunt needed help.

463
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,550
怎么  那次也算我欠你的吗
What? So I owe you for that too?

464
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,630
没错
Yeah, you do.

465
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,700
你我都清楚假如我被定罪了
You and I both know if I get convicted,

466
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,050
那个和解协议就会被重新审理
that settlement's gonna get reopened.

467
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,920
那你当时到底为什么要接受那个协议  迈克
Then why the hell did you take it, Mike?

468
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,140
为什么
Why?

469
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,010
吉米  我当时走了捷径
Jimmy, I took a shortcut, man.

470
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,740
就和你曾经也走过捷径一样
Just like you took a shortcut once.

471
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,260
假如我能收回一切  我会的
Now, if I could take it all back, I would,

472
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,160
但我做不到
but I can't.

473
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,170
就和你曾经求过我一样
And just like you begged me once,

474
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,320
我现在来找你  来求你
I am coming to you and begging you right now.

475
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,480
拜托了
Please.

476
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,760
求你帮帮我
Please help me.

477
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,950
没有一个脑子正常的人
No one in their right mind

478
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,870
会答应你求我做的事
would do what you're asking me to.

479
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,440
并非如此
That's not true.

480
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,910
-哈罗德去找你了吗  -没错
- Harold come to you? - Mm-hmm.

481
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,540
但你知道哈罗德
But you know Harold

482
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,970
在证人席上是撑不住的  但我可以
won't hold up on the stand and I would.

483
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:23,890
是不是
Right?

484
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,940
-吉米  我需要你...  -迈克
- Jimmy, I need you-- - Michael.

485
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,130
听着  兄弟  我很抱歉
Look, brother, I'm sorry.

486
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,220
我真的很希望自己能帮你
I really wish I could help,

487
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,480
但我不能为你而冒进监狱的风险
but I cannot risk going to prison for you.

488
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,210
我做不到
I can't.

489
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,910
喂
Hello?

490
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,910
路易  是我
Louis, it's me.

491
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,080
希拉  我明确告诉过你
Sheila, I explicitly told you,

492
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,920
"在打完官司前不要打电话给我"
"Do not call me until after the trial is over."

493
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,960
我们不能冒任何险...
We can't take any chances--

494
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,530
有人找到我了  路易
Someone approached me, Louis.

495
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,260
什么叫有人找到你了
What do you mean someone approached you?

496
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,400
就在我住的酒店
At my hotel.

497
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,750
我当时在大堂
I was in the lobby.

498
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,490
一个男人上来和我说话
A man came up to me and started talking.

499
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,800
他说是从纽约来的
He said he was from New York.

500
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,190
想知道我计划去阿根廷旅行
He wanted to know how long I'd been

501
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,700
计划多久了
planning a trip to Argentina.

502
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,130
还问我打算待多久
Then he asked how long I was planning on staying

503
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,120
最后还问我
and, finally, did anyone pay

504
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,860
是否有人出钱让我来这儿
for my ticket to come down here?

505
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,060
那你是怎么回答他的
W-what did you tell him?

506
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,560
我说那不关他的事
That it was none of his business.

507
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,100
很好  很聪明
Good. That was smart.

508
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,500
不能让他们觉得已经把你握在手心了
You didn't show them that they got to you.

509
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,060
路易  他们已经把我握在手心了
Louis, they did get to me.

510
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,250
听我说
Listen to me.

511
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,270
他们没传唤你  所以你没做错什么
They did not subpoena you, so you did nothing wrong.

512
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,920
你只是旅个行而已
You just took a trip.

513
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,850
就算吉布斯能咬定谁做了什么  那也是我
Now, if Gibbs can prove anyone did anything, it is me.

514
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,420
我会不惜一切保护你的
And I will do anything to protect you, okay?

515
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,630
对不起  路易  我得挂了
I'm sorry, Louis. I have to go.

516
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,140
难以置信
I don't believe you.

517
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,870
你居然让瑞秋当第一个证人
You're calling Rachel as your first witness?

518
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,170
没错
I sure as hell am.

519
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,620
吉布斯传唤不了瑞秋  我们已经搞定这个了
Gibbs can't call Rachel. We took care of that.

520
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,480
我们只让她没办法耍手段
We took care of her going out of bounds

521
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,820
让瑞秋指认你
to get Rachel to turn on you.

522
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,750
没让她不能传唤瑞秋
We didn't do anything to stop her calling Rachel

523
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,830
出庭作证  你心里清楚
to the stand, and you know it.

524
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,030
那我现在郑重声明
Fine, then I'm stipulating right now

525
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,570
对所有问题  瑞秋都引用第五修正案
Rachel's taking the fifth to any questions.

526
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,310
胡说
Oh, bullshit.

527
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,680
我们都知道
You know as well as I do,

528
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,730
私人问题上她没办法引用第五修正案
she can't take the fifth to personal questions.

529
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,350
所以你为了吓唬我
So you're just gonna humiliate her

530
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,310
就要羞辱她吗
so you can rattle me?

531
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,710
你说对了
You're damn right I am.

532
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,450
吉布斯也会做同样的事
Gibbs is gonna do the exact same thing.

533
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,680
她不会再陪审团面前
She is not gonna do that to Rachel

534
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,090
羞辱瑞秋  因为那会让她自贬身价
in front of a jury, because it will make her look like shit.

535
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,150
她可不关心自己的身价
She doesn't care about that.

536
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,170
不  不关心的人是你
No, you're the one that doesn't care about that.

537
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,500
因为这已经不是为我的案子着想了
'Cause this is no longer about what's best for my case;

538
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,170
你是单纯的不想输给我
it's because you don't want to lose to me.

539
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,790
我不会输给你
I'm not going to lose to you.

540
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,690
你知道吗  哈维  我...
You know what, Harvey? I am--

541
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,630
别吵了
That's enough.

542
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,420
你们俩在这儿吵个没完的时候
While you two have been having your pissing contest,

543
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,030
我一直在翻旧文件
I've been poring over discovery,

544
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,630
我发现了迈克大一的班级排名
and I came across the class rankings from Mike's first year.

545
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,000
别告诉我上面没有他
Don't tell me-- he's not on it.

546
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,040
-确实没有  -这说不通
- No, he's not. - Doesn't make any sense.

547
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,000
说得通
Yes, it does.

548
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,200
罗拉没改完所有文件
Lola must not have covered all the bases.

549
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,130
那我们得让她都改完
Then we need to get her to cover all the bases.

550
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,400
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

551
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,960
你去找罗拉  就把吉布斯引过去了
You go to Lola, you lead Gibbs right to her,

552
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,050
这件事还没来得及开始就会结束
and this thing is over before it even gets started.

553
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,390
那我们让本杰明改
Okay, then we get Benjamin to do it.

554
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,140
不能再让别人知道你的秘密了
We are not letting another person in on your secret.

555
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,450
那你觉得我们该怎么办
Well, then what do you suggest we do?

556
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,950
我们要搞定所有让我们
What we were gonna do with every other piece

557
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,840
看起来有罪的证据
of evidence that makes us look like shit.

558
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,910
让那些证据不堪一击
We find a way to make it look like shit.

559
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,400
哈佛不可能碰巧忘了
There is no way that Harvard accidentally forgets

560
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,000
给一个学生排名
to put a student on this list.

561
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,110
要我说就去找本杰明
I say we go to Benjamin.

562
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,780
你要是再提这个
And I say I'll lock you in a room

563
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,930
我就把你锁进小黑屋直到开庭
until this trial starts if you say that again.

564
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,890
看来只能胜者做决定了
Then I guess whoever wins makes the call.

565
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,490
要是还没分出胜负你就背着我去找本杰明
You go to Benjamin behind my back before we're done,

566
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,010
那坐牢都算
and you going to prison is gonna be

567
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,650
便宜你了
the least of your problems.

568
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,200
迈克  你怎么像被痛扁了一顿似的
Mike, you like you've been through the wringer.

569
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,040
我得问你个问题
I have to ask you a question, and...

570
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,800
希望你诚实回答我
I want you to tell me the truth.

571
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,820
你问吧
Well, of course.

572
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,180
你觉得我是该自己为自己辩护
Do you really think I should be the one up there

573
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,300
还是让哈维为我辩护
fighting for my life, or do you think Harvey should be?

574
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,940
我觉得
I think that...

575
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,180
只有你能做这个决定
You're the best person to make that call,

576
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,720
无论你怎么决定  我都完全支持
And that whatever you decide, I'm with you 100%.

577
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,330
那我得拜托本杰明为我们做件事
Well, then I need to ask Benjamin to do something for us,

578
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,760
哈维肯定相当不满
and Harvey is really not gonna like it.

579
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,400
不管什么事  只要你认为有必要
Whatever it is, if you think we need to do it,

580
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,410
我就支持你
I'm with you.

581
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,120
{\an8}哈佛大学毕业证书
迈克尔・詹姆斯・罗斯

582
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,740
已经搞定了
It's done?

583
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,320
是的
Yes.

584
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,520
管不了一世  但顶得了一时
It won't hold up forever, but it will hold up for now.

585
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,160
谢谢  本杰明
Thank you, Benjamin. I--

586
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,800
我没想到这么快
I didn't expect it for a couple of hours.

587
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,910
都没来得及给你弄点吃的
I-I haven't had a chance to get you any bacon.

588
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,410
没关系  迈克尔
That's quite all right, Michael.

589
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,760
这次算我请你
This one is on the house.

590
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,190
你从没问过我
You know, you never asked if what

591
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,000
那些流言是不是真的
they're saying about me is true.

592
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,490
用不着问
I didn't need to.

593
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,330
我一听就知道是真的
I knew it was true the second I heard it.

594
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,800
我不明白
I don't understand.

595
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,250
念过哈佛的那些孩子
All these kids who went to Harvard,

596
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,880
他们从不在意我
They never gave me the time of day.

597
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,710
他们只想让我知道
All they cared about was letting me know

598
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,990
他们念过而我没念过的大学
where they went to school and I didn't.

599
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,210
你从没这么对我
You've never done that to me.

600
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,880
一次都没有
Not one time.

601
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,730
我不知道该说什么
I--I don't know what to say.

602
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,440
就说等你搞定这件事之后
Say that when you're done and you've beaten this thing,

603
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,960
你不会开始像那些念过哈佛的人一样混蛋
You won't start acting like some asshole who went to harvard.

604
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,730
这个真没法保证  本杰明
Well, I mean, can't really promise you that, Benjamin.

605
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,780
我就要念过哈佛了
I'll have gone to Harvard.

606
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,920
一点不好笑  迈克尔
That's not funny, Michael.

607
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,340
检方准备好传唤下一位证人了吗
Is the prosecution ready to call its next witness?

608
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,790
检方传唤瑞秋・赞恩
Prosecution calls Rachel Zane.

609
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,580
反对
Objection.

610
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,370
法官大人  证人不能因为要引用第五修正案
Your Honor, the witness cannot object to testifying

611
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,920
就随便拒绝作证
simply because she intends to take the fifth.

612
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,430
证人不需要作证是因为她是我的妻子
The witness doesn't have to testify because she's my wife.

613
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,130
什么
What?

614
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,380
我这里有份内华达州的
I have a marriage certificate here

615
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,040
结婚证明能表明
from the state of Nevada showing that

616
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,220
证人和我在交往六周后
the witness and I were married in Las Vegas

617
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,990
就在拉斯维加斯结婚了
six weeks after we started dating.

618
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,660
你们俩都过来
Both of you up here, now.

619
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,190
你到底从哪儿弄来的证明
Where the hell did you get that?

620
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:56,920
什么意思
What do you mean?

621
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,060
你明知道你没娶她
You didn't marry her, and you know it.

622
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,740
那我怎么会有娶了她的证明
Then why do I have everything I need proving I did?

623
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,840
因为你耍了手段
Because you did some bullshit to get out of this.

624
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,480
看看谁要哭了
Oh, look who's crying about it now.

625
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,470
你们都小点声
Keep your voices down.

626
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,910
你当这是玩笑吗
You think this is a joke?

627
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,170
你要是在法庭上用这招
You try this in court,

628
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,040
吉布斯会证明你没结婚
Gibbs is gonna prove you're not married,

629
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,740
瑞秋就要因伪造罪坐牢了
and Rachel's gonna go to jail for perjury.

630
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,360
他说的没错  你最好清楚自己在做什么
He's right; you better know what the hell you're doing.

631
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,240
谁说我要在真正的法庭上用这个了
Who said that I was gonna use this in the real trial?

632
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,460
我懂了  这是假的  就像你一样
I get it. This is a fake, just like you.

633
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,800
我让你小点声
I said keep your goddamn voice down.

634
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,590
这份证明和那份证词一样真
This is as real as that affidavit was, okay?

635
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,060
你想打败我吗  我现在已经打败你了
Now, you wanted to rattle me; I've rattled you.

636
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,240
你能怎么办
What are you gonna do about it?

637
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,450
检方传唤瑞秋・赞恩作证
Prosecution calls Rachel Zane to the stand.

638
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,850
反对  我们刚已经说清楚了
Objection. We just went over this.

639
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,900
当涉及配偶特权时
When spousal privilege is invoked in the moment,

640
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,020
检方有权挑战
prosecution has the right to challenge

641
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,270
这段婚姻的真实性
the validity of the marriage.

642
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,400
-这真是荒唐  -反对无效
- This is ridiculous. - Objection overruled.

643
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,880
赞恩小姐  请出庭作证
Ms. Zane, take the stand.

644
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,950
我们可以跳过让她宣誓那部分
We can skip swearing her in

645
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,660
反正她也不会说真话
since she's just gonna lie about it, anyway.

646
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,570
反对
Objection!

647
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:48,220
赞恩小姐  若你和被告在约会六周后就结婚了
Ms. Zane, if you got married six weeks after dating the defendant, 

648
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,060
为什么现在又和他订婚了呢
why are you engaged to him right now?

649
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,810
那时候只是一时兴起
Because we did it on a whim.

650
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,710
而且我们也打算要撤销的
And we had planned to have an annulment,

651
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,380
但后来我们越来越相爱  我们觉得
but once we fell more in love, we thought that it

652
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,500
或许等再结婚了再告诉家人们
might be wonderful to reveal it to our families

653
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,640
也是个不错的主意
after we were married again.

654
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,730
那你们第一次结婚的时候
And how, exactly, did it go

655
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,850
具体是个什么情形呢
when you got married the first time?

656
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,330
我们当时是在拉斯维加斯
We were in Las Vegas--

657
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,860
我没兴趣知道你们在哪里
Yeah, yeah, I don't give a shit where you were.

658
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,280
你的婚纱是什么颜色的  蛋糕又是什么颜色的
What color was your dress? What color was the cake?

659
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,370
-反对  -当时有谁在场
- Objection. - Who was there?

660
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,700
-有任何证人吗  -法官大人  他骚扰证人
- Were there any witnesses? - Your Honor, he's badgering--

661
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,970
都有谁看到了  而且具体是几点
Who were the witnesses? And what goddamn time was it?

662
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,210
法官大人  让他下来
Your honor, get him off of her!

663
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,060
-哈维  -现在就告诉我
- Harvey... - Tell me right now.

664
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,680
让证人先回答
Let the witness answer.

665
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,590
婚纱是白色的
The dress was white.

666
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,390
蛋糕是香草味的  上面撒着奶油糖霜
And the cake was vanilla with a buttercream frosting.

667
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,580
典礼很小  大概在晚上10点左右
It was a small ceremony at around 10:00 p.m.

668
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,990
我还记得那个为我们证婚的人
And I remember the man who married us

669
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,540
一切都如昨日般清晰
like it was yesterday

670
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,290
因为那是我一生中最特别的一天
because it was the most special day of my life.

671
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,750
那当你编这个故事的时候
And when you came up with this story,

672
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,670
罗斯先生有没有至少给你自由发挥的权利
did Mr. Ross at least give you the courtesy of

673
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,430
让你自己编你那所谓的神圣的一天
letting you make up your own memories of your supposedly sacred day?

674
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,140
反对
Objection.

675
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,090
既然  他选择在庭审中自己打辩护
Since, if he represents himself at trial,

676
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,460
你可能在未来的两到五年里都不会有婚礼了
you won't have a real wedding for at least two to five years.

677
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,210
哈维
Harvey.

678
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,540
我还有一个问题
And I've got one more question:

679
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,240
你有没有发誓在整段婚姻中
Did you vow to remain faithful to Mr. Ross

680
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,640
都对罗斯先生忠贞不渝
throughout your marriage?

681
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,750
是的  我说过
Yes, I did.

682
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,940
那我猜当你背着他跟洛根・桑德斯
Yeah, then I guess when you cheated on him

683
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,770
偷情的时候  就说明你在那个
with Logan Sanders, it means you lied to him

684
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,220
根本不存在的典礼上说的是假话
at that non-existent ceremony,

685
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,300
就像你现在在骗我们一样
just like you're lying to all of us right now.

686
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,730
够了
That's enough.

687
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,860
如果你想用更多的无关消息
If you want to bring more outside information

688
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,170
来反驳这桩婚事的话  请自便  但现在
to dispute this marriage, feel free, but for right now...

689
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,270
证人可以离席了
this witness is excused.

690
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,600
路易  不管什么事  等下再说
Louis, whatever it is, it's going to have to wait.

691
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,630
不行  等不了了
No, it's not gonna wait, 

692
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,340
因为你说过你会搞定吉布斯的
because you said you'd take care of Gibbs.

693
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,430
我的确有搞定吉布斯啊
I did take care of Gibbs.

694
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,430
那为什么她办公室里有人
Well, then why the hell did someone from her office

695
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,540
联系了身在阿根廷的希拉
contact Sheila in Argentina?

696
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,160
路易  他们只是在吓唬你罢了
Louis, they're just trying to scare you.

697
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,390
而且就算她和盘托出
And even if she tells them everything,

698
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,320
你也没做错什么
you did nothing wrong with Sheila.

699
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,370
那迈克的事呢
What about what we did with Mike?

700
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,190
他们唯一能证明我们知道迈克的事的证据
The only proof they'll ever have that we knew about mike

701
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,950
就是我们自己亲口承认
is if we tell them.

702
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,680
如果他们问到我  我就引用第五修正案
And when they ask me, I'm going to take the Fifth,

703
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,650
你也是如此
and you are going to do the same thing.

704
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,640
这还不够好
That is not good enough.

705
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,790
我不想引用第五修正案
I don't want to take the Fifth.

706
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,960
-你说什么  -你听到了的
- Excuse me? - You heard me.

707
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,310
你先被传唤  你先上庭
You get called first, you get up there,

708
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,860
你看着他们的眼睛
and you look them straight in the eye,

709
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,290
你告诉他们迈克上了哈佛
and you tell them Mike went to Harvard.

710
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,170
是你决定雇的他
It was your decision to hire him,

711
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,150
而且你绝对坚持这个决定
and you stand by it 100%.

712
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:03,860
发生什么事了
What's going on?

713
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,430
事情就是杰西卡让我干扰证人时
What's going on is that Jessica's happy asking me

714
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,000
倒是很轻松  轮到她自己上庭了
to witness tamper, but when it comes to her

715
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,100
她倒不
getting on the stand, she won't--

716
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,170
干扰证人  你让他干什么了
Witness tamper? What did you have him do?

717
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,850
她让我把希拉弄出国去
She had me move Sheila out of the country.

718
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,740
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

719
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,850
我只是做了我必须做的事
Look, I did what I had to do.

720
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,880
那你怎么不为我做点必须做的事
Then why won't you do what you have to do for me?

721
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,480
因为如果我做了  那我就有作伪证之嫌了
Because if I did that, it would open me up to perjury.

722
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,400
如果迈克真的被判有罪
If Mike gets convicted, 

723
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,610
你作个伪证又有什么关系
what does it matter if you perjure yourself?

724
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,510
都给我闭嘴
Both of you be quiet.

725
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,600
看看谁来了
Look who's coming.

726
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,330
看看都是谁啊  三个火枪手啊
Look who it is. The Three Musketeers.

727
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,010
我们正在开会
And we happen to be in the middle of a meeting.

728
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,830
没关系  我只是来提醒一下
That's okay; I just dropped by to let you know

729
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,930
好像庭审被提前到明天了
it looks like the trial's been moved up till tomorrow.

730
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,260
你干了什么
What the hell did you do?

731
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,510
我去找了法官  我说  法官大人
I went to the judge, and I said, "Your Honor,

732
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,750
我想在我仅有的证人都消失前
"I'd like to start this thing before

733
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,930
开始这场庭审
every single witness I have disappears."

734
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,690
没有我们在场她是不可能同意的
No way she granted this without us present.

735
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,430
你可以争取一下  如果你想的话
Oh, you can fight it, if you want.

736
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,760
我们可以等到赛斯女士旅游完回来
We'll wait for Ms. Sazs to finish her trip.

737
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,440
对此利特先生看起来很不安呢
Oh, Mr. Litt seems upset about that.

738
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,620
看来我对你们使的离间计
Looks like the wedge I'm driving between you

739
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,830
开始起作用了
is starting to work.

740
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,140
你的离间计屁用没有
Your wedge hasn't done shit.

741
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,110
我再告诉你一件事
And I'm gonna tell you something else.

742
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,410
你让我上庭
You put me on that stand,

743
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,220
我就看着陪审团的眼睛
and I will look the jury straight in the eye

744
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,730
明明白白地告诉他们迈克・罗斯是
and tell them that Mike Ross is the best

745
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,820
我遇到过哈佛教出的最好的律师
goddamn Harvard-educated attorney I have ever met.

746
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,070
是我雇了他
I hired him.

747
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,570
是我的决定  而且我绝对坚持该决定
It was my decision, and I stand by it 100%.

748
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,380
而我之后的每个人
And everyone that comes after me

749
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,390
都会说一样的话
will say the same thing.

750
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,570
你觉得她吃你这一套吗
You think she bought that?

751
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,390
管她吃不吃呢
I don't care if she bought it or not.

752
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,580
我不是虚张声势
I wasn't bluffing.

753
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,850
你和迈克最好想想
And you and Mike better figure out

754
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,680
到底该怎么做
what the hell you're going to do

755
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,880
因为明天就开庭了
because the trial starts tomorrow.

756
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,960
一周在这儿碰到你两次
What a coincidence running into you here

757
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,140
真巧啊
twice in one week.

758
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,940
鼓励就算了
You can skip trying to cheer me up,

759
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,530
反正也不管用
because it's not gonna work.

760
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,660
-瑞秋  -我不想听
- Rachel-- - I don't want to hear it.

761
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,700
他在整个律所的人面前羞辱我
He humiliated me in front of the entire firm.

762
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,660
是的
Yeah, he did.

763
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,930
但你不能确定迈克能不能撑得住
But you weren't sure if Mike could handle this or not.

764
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,440
至少现在  如果他真不行
And at least now, if he can't,

765
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,000
你可以不做那个去告诉他此事的恶人
you won't have to be the one to tell him.

766
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,990
这话你说起来容易  因为你根本不知道
That is so easy for you to say, because you have no idea

767
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,450
经历这一切是什么样的感受
what it felt like to go through that.

768
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:10,970
你错了
You're wrong.

769
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,240
我确确实实地知道那是什么感觉
I know exactly what it feels like.

770
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,950
你是指什么
What are you talking about?

771
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,590
想象一下当我弃他投奔路易时他是怎么对我的
Try to imagine how he treated me when I left him for Louis.

772
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,720
或许你真的懂
Maybe you do know.

773
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,200
是的  我懂
Yeah. I do.

774
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,180
而且
And...

775
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,190
我还知道  无人能及地
I also know that, like nobody else,

776
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,220
哈维有这个能力
Harvey has this ability

777
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,810
屏蔽一切  不再把你当人看
to just shut off and not see you as a person anymore.

778
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,360
这能力真是让我郁闷
Well, that ability makes me sick.

779
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,620
这可能也是他成功的
It's also probably one of the things

780
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,300
因素之一吧
that makes him such a great lawyer.

781
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,050
-你来干什么  -我们有麻烦了
- What are you doing here? - We got a problem.

782
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,310
你是说除了你今天的行为吗
You mean besides what you did today?

783
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,270
-迈克  听我说  -不  你听我说
- Mike, listen to me. - No, you listen to me.

784
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,760
-那真的是太过分了  -明天开庭
- That was over the line-- - The trial starts tomorrow.

785
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,580
什么
What?

786
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,250
不  吉布斯做不到的
No. Gibbs can't do that.

787
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,550
严格来说她的确不行
Technically she can't,

788
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,490
但相信我  我们也没有站得住脚的理由反对
But trust me, we don't have a leg to stand on.

789
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,320
好吧
Fine.

790
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,490
那我就提交申请由我自行辩护
Then I'm filing the motion to be my own attorney.

791
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,530
-迈克  -我不想听
- Mike--no. - I don't want to hear it.

792
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,970
你没有打败我  好吗
You didn't beat me, all right?

793
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,750
你可以作第二辩护人或不为我辩护  但我要当首席辩护人
So you can be second chair or no chair, but I am first chair.

794
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,450
该死的  迈克
God damn it, Mike.

795
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,120
你不知道你在干什么
You don't know what you're doing.

796
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,410
在你对瑞秋痛下狠手之后
Do you really think I'm gonna let you

797
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,200
你真的以为我会让你来保护我吗
protect me after what you did to Rachel today?

798
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,900
我对瑞秋毫不留情全是为了你
I did that to Rachel for you,

799
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,690
如果你连这都看不透  你不能赢这场庭审
and if you can't see that, you can't win this trial.

800
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,150
我能  而且我会
I can, and I will!

801
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,420
够了
That's enough!

802
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,130
瑞秋  没事儿  我能解决这事儿
Rachel, it's fine. I can handle this.

803
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,250
我不在乎   我不想让你来处理此事
I don't care. I don't want you to handle this.

804
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,660
什么
What?

805
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,390
你说过你百分之百支持我
You said you were with me 100%.

806
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,000
那是谎话吗
Was that a lie?

807
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
不是  只是哈维今天对我做的一切太残忍
No, but what Harvey had to do to me today was brutal,

808
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,100
不管最终由谁为你辩护
and whoever ends up representing you has to do

809
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,910
都会对特雷弗做相同的事
the same thing to Trevor.

810
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,900
你觉得我不能对特雷弗做出相同的事吗
You don't think I can do the same thing to Trevor?

811
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,200
我知道你能
I know you can.

812
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,870
但是当哈维质证我时  我很讨厌他
But I hated Harvey while he was doing it to me,

813
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,920
而你质证特雷弗时
and they're going to hate you

814
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,700
他们也会讨厌你
while you're doing it to Trevor.

815
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,890
而且  迈克  我们不能让陪审团讨厌你
And, Mike, we can't have the jury hating you,

816
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,960
但是我们可以让他们讨厌哈维
but we can let them hate Harvey.

817
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,200
埃文斯先生  在罗斯先生声称他就读于哈佛大学期间
Mr. Evans, is it true that you were living with Mr. Ross

818
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,030
你确实跟他住在一起是吗
in and around the time he claims to have attended Harvard?

819
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,060
没错  我们共住一间公寓
Yes, we shared an apartment

820
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,850
地址是布鲁克林区亨廷顿达到5307号
at 5307 Huntington Boulevard in Brooklyn.

821
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,190
他是如何支付他的房租呢
And how exactly did he pay his rent?

822
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,450
他找了一份邮递员的差事  然后又做了一份兼职
He worked as a bike messenger and made money on the side

823
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,210
专替别人参加法学院入学考试
taking the LSATs for people.

824
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,990
等一下  我有点糊涂了
Oh, wait, I'm confused.

825
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,260
他为何要依靠那种手段谋生
Why would he have to resort to that

826
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,630
如果他是一名大学毕业生
if he were a college graduate?

827
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,380
因为他不是大学生毕业生
Because he wasn't a college graduate.

828
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,320
什么
What?

829
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,330
你是说他没有从大学毕业吗
You mean he never graduated from college?

830
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,470
对  他因为考试作弊而被学校开除
No, he was kicked out of college for cheating on a test.

831
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,840
这样啊  那有没有可能
Well, isn't it possible

832
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,830
在你和他住在一起时
that while he was living with you,

833
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,810
他又回到了学校  然后完成了他的学业
he went back to school and completed his degree?

834
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,310
{\an8}罗尔斯法官

835
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,610
我不知道他怎么办到那点  因为他的大部分空闲时间
Well, I don't see how, since most of his spare time

836
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,760
都花在和我一起吸大麻上
was spent sitting around smoking weed with me.

837
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,320
让我来理理思路
Well, let me get this straight.

838
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,450
在他被皮尔逊-斯佩克特雇佣之前
Before he was employed at Pearson Specter,

839
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,750
你所清楚知道的是  他从事了一份
to the best of your knowledge, he worked as

840
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:15,150
邮递员的工作  还兼职替他人参加法学院入学考试
a bike messenger and a part-time LSAT imposter?

841
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,130
没错
Yes.

842
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,430
最后一个问题  埃文斯先生
One last question, Mr. Evans.

843
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,920
有没有一丝可能迈克・罗斯
Is it at all possible that Mike Ross

844
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,040
曾经在哈佛大学法学院上过学
ever attended Harvard law school?

845
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,970
除非他们在布鲁克林区亨廷顿大道5307号
Not unless they had a satellite campus at

846
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,890
建了分校
5307 Huntington Boulevard in Brooklyn.

847
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,890
问题问完了  法官大人
No more questions, your honor.

848
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,200
由于你吸食大麻  埃文斯先生
Given that you smoked all this pot, Mr. Evans,

849
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,830
有没有可能迈克・罗斯一周一次
isn't it possible that if Mike Ross commuted one day

850
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,530
前往哈佛大学法学院读书  而你又不记得那天
a week to Harvard law that you might not remember that?

851
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,490
我记得
I'd remember.

852
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,790
没错  或许你记得  但是不管怎样
Yeah, maybe you would, but you'd lie

853
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,550
你都会对那件事撒谎  对吗
through your teeth about it anyway, wouldn't you?

854
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,520
反对
Objection.

855
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,510
埃文斯先生  你是不是一名长期的毒品贩子
Mr. Evans, isn't it true that you're a long-time

856
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,730
而你今天之所以会在此作证
drug dealer and your testimony today is only happening

857
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,290
全是因为你和吉布斯达成协议  她会给你豁免权
because you signed a deal with Ms. Gibbs giving you immunity?

858
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,260
那也不表示我在撒谎
Doesn't mean I'm lying.

859
00:31:59,260 --> 00:31:59,990
你不会撒谎
Because you wouldn't lie

860
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,670
是因为你不想进监狱吗
just to get out of going to prison?

861
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,890
对  我不会
No, I would not.

862
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,870
那你觉得另外一个理由怎么样
Well, how about if the other reason was to get back

863
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,100
你这样做是为了报复你这辈子都嫉妒的人
at someone you've been jealous of your entire life?

864
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,500
我这辈子从未嫉妒过迈克・罗斯
I've never been jealous of Mike Ross in my entire life.

865
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,860
我正好发现你在撒谎
And I just caught you in a lie.

866
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,180
反对  法官大人
Objection, your honor.

867
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,330
埃文斯先生  我下一步将要传唤
Mr. Evans, my next move is gonna be to call

868
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,020
珍妮・格里菲思出庭
Jenny Griffith to the stand,

869
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,600
她将会证实你关于毒品交易一事
and she's gonna testify that you lied to her for years

870
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,230
对她撒了数年的谎  当她发现时
about dealing, and when she found out about it,

871
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,520
她离开了你  和迈克・罗斯在一起了
she left you for Mike Ross.

872
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,780
反对  纠缠证人
Objection. Badgering.

873
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,430
她还会说你嫉妒他的头脑
She's also gonna say that you were jealous of his mind

874
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,410
你这辈都在嫉妒  当你发现
your entire life, and when you found out

875
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,100
她离开你而和他在一起时
that she left you for him, you were as jealous

876
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,430
你的嫉妒达到了人类的极限
as a human being can be.

877
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,390
-那是真是假  -法官大人
- Now, is that true or not? - Your Honor.

878
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,320
让我换个说法
Let me rephrase.

879
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,670
是格里菲思女士会做伪证  还是你
Is Ms. Griffith going to be perjuring herself or are you?

880
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,620
没错  我嫉妒他
Yeah, I was jealous of him.

881
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,240
如果他对那件事都撒谎  还有什么能够让我们相信
And if he lied about all of that, what's to make us believe

882
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,380
他没有对其他事情撒谎呢
that he wasn't lying about everything else?

883
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,650
没有问题了  法官大人
No further questions, Your Honor.

884
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,870
法官大人  控诉方传唤唐娜・鲍尔森出席
Your honor, prosecution calls Donna Paulsen to the stand.

885
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,530
别担心  唐娜
Don't worry, Donna.

886
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,950
她不会直截了当地问你是否知道迈克是骗子
She won't ask you point-blank if you knew Mike was a fraud.

887
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,930
如果她这样问呢
What if she does?

888
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,450
如果你撒谎
If you lie,

889
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,200
他们永远不会知道
they'll never know.

890
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,890
鲍尔森女士  据我所知是你安排
Ms. Paulsen, it's my understanding that you arranged

891
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,380
斯佩克特先生的那场面试  而面试的职务目前正由
Mr. Specter's interviews for the position currently filled

892
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,210
迈克尔・罗斯担任
by Michael Ross.

893
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,220
对吗
Is that correct?

894
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,880
我协助了面试过程  没错
I assisted in the process, yes.

895
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,880
你有没有觉得罗斯先生的第一学年成绩
Did you find it suspicious that Mr. Ross

896
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,150
并没有列入哈佛大学班级排名中这点很可疑
wasn't listed on the Harvard class ranking from his first year?

897
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,990
-我没有  -为什么
- No, I didn't. - And why is that?

898
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,800
因为我从未被列入任何班级排名上
Because I've never been on any class ranking,

899
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,110
而且我现在是本市里最出色的律师秘书
and I'm the best legal secretary in the city.

900
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,350
哇  真是一个巧妙的回答  鲍尔森女士
Wow, that's a quippy response, Ms. Paulsen.

901
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,180
但是如果你如此擅长你的工作  那你怎会
But if you were so good at your job, how would you

902
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,900
允许一个没有出现在面试名单上的人
allow someone who wasn't even on the interview list

903
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,160
走进房间单独和哈维・斯佩克特待在一起
to get in a room alone with Harvey Specter?

904
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,820
我敢肯定你记得这张名单
I'm sure you'll recognize this list.

905
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,160
不管怎么样  是你打印的
After all, you typed it up.

906
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,940
而且看起来他的名字也没有出现在这张名单上
And it looks like his name isn't on this one either.

907
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,710
对  他不在名单上  但是他足够机灵
No, he wasn't on the list, but he was smart enough

908
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,900
仅凭几句话就进去了
to talk to his way in,

909
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,340
这正是一名优秀律师所做的
which is what a good lawyer does and exactly

910
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,390
而且也正是我要找的人
what I was looking for.

911
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,430
他到底说了什么就进去了
How exactly did he talk his way in?

912
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,160
回答问题  鲍尔森女士
Answer the question, Ms. Paulsen.

913
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,880
他顶替了别人的位置
He took someone else's spot.

914
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,930
你是指他说是他是别人
You mean he said he was someone else.

915
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,980
你宣过誓  鲍尔森女士
You're under oath, Ms. Paulsen.

916
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,370
要我提醒你作伪证会被判刑
May I remind you that perjury carries a sentence

917
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,040
最高五年的监禁吗
of up to five years?

918
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,050
他是不是说他是别人
Did he say he was someone else?

919
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,100
-他说他是里克・苏尔钦  -哼
- He said he was Rick Sorkin. - Ha.

920
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,370
所以你初见罗斯先生时  他就是个骗子
So your first introduction to Mr. Ross was as an imposter?

921
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,290
我没这样说
I didn't say that.

922
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,570
你说过他对他的名字撒谎
You said he lied about what his name was.

923
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,710
那他就是骗子
That makes him an imposter.

924
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,540
你是要撤销你的证词吗
Are you going to recant your testimony?

925
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,640
别看着他
Don't look at him.

926
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,050
不  我不撤销
No, I'm not recanting.

927
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,370
那就好
All right.

928
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:03,450
所以现在我们已经确定罗斯先生是个骗子
So now we've established that Mr. Ross is a liar.

929
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,560
那现在我们就要查明你是不是骗子
And now we're gonna find out if you're a liar.

930
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,960
所以  鲍尔森女士
So, Ms. Paulsen,

931
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,430
据你所知
To the best of your knowledge,

932
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:16,260
迈克・罗斯有没有到哈佛大学法学院上过学
did Mike Ross go to Harvard law school or not?

933
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,120
我要使用宪法第五修正案赋予我的权利
I'd like to assert my Fifth Amendment Right.

934
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,760
别不好受  鲍尔森女士
Don't feel bad, Ms. Paulsen.

935
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,650
我敢肯定其他人也会做相同的事情...
I'm sure others will do the same thing too...

936
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,140
因为...
Because...

937
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,140
辩护人不能提供任何证人
The defense cannot produce one person

938
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,440
以证明迈克・罗斯曾在哈佛法学院学习
who can place Mike Ross at Harvard Law.

939
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,610
我的问题问完了  法官大人
The witness could be excused, Your Honor.

940
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,920
我认为我们已经听够了
I think we've heard all we need to hear.

941
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,090
被告申请传唤吉米・柯克伍德出庭作证
Defense would like to call Jimmy Kirkwood to the stand.

942
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,620
反对
Objection.

943
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,300
他不在证人名单上
His name was not on the witness list.

944
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,530
反证证人
Rebuttal witness.

945
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,640
她刚才说我们找不到任何人证明
She just said we can't produce someone who places

946
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,530
迈克上过哈佛  我说我们可以
Mike at Harvard, and I say we can.

947
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,150
法官大人
Your Honor--

948
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,890
斯佩克特先生有他的权利
Mr. Specter is within his rights.

949
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,860
柯克伍德先生可以作证
Mr. Kirkwood can take the stand.

950
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,460
你怎么知道他愿意作证
How did you know he'd testify?

951
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,920
刚知道
I didn't until just now.

952
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,860
我刚认识迈克时  就在想
Well, when I first met Mike, I thought,

953
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,830
"这个平时从不出现
"Who is this asshole

954
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,170
只来参加考试的混蛋是谁啊"
"Who only ever shows up for tests?"

955
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,260
他是我见过最傲慢的贱人
Cockiest son of a bitch I ever saw.

956
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,630
但之后在吉拉德教授的课上争论一个道德问题时
But then I really got to know Mike when we were arguing

957
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,900
我真的认识了迈克
over an ethics question in professor Gerard's class.

958
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,260
一个越过界的律师
Should a lawyer who's crossed a line

959
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,990
应该得到第二次机会吗
be given a second chance?

960
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,770
我觉得不应该  但迈克意见相反
I didn't think so, but Mike did,

961
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,060
那时我意识到  迈克・罗斯的小指头里
and that's when I realized that Mike Ross has more integrity

962
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,550
存有的正直和同情心
and compassion in his little finger

963
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,560
比我见过的任何一个律师都多
than any other lawyer I've ever met.

964
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,520
如果我面临性命攸关的审判
And if I was on trial for my life,

965
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,430
我希望站在我身边的
There's no one I'd rather have on my side

966
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,760
除了我的哈佛同学迈克・罗斯外  没有别人
than my fellow Harvard alum Mike Ross.

967
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,530
我们说清楚些
Just so we're 100% clear,

968
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,640
迈克・罗斯是跟你一起上的哈佛法学院吗
was Mike Ross a student at Harvard Law School with you?

969
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,350
是的
Yes, he was.

970
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,550
没有其他问题了  法官大人
No further questions, Your Honor.

971
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,250
我们现在听够了
Now we've heard enough.

972
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,900
吉布斯女士  我给你24小时准备交叉质询
Ms. Gibbs, I'll give you 24 hours to prepare for cross.

973
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,840
我不需要24小时  法官大人
Oh, I don't need 24 hours, Your Honor.

974
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,610
柯克伍德先生  两天前
Mr. Kirkwood, isn't it true that two days ago,

975
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:34,370
罗斯先生有没有在你办公室外见你
Mr. Ross contacted you on the street outside of your Office 

976
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,700
而你们发生了激烈的争吵
and the two of you got into a heated argument?

977
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,920
我有照片  你想看看吗
I have the pictures. Would you like to see them?

978
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,480
是这样
Yes, it's true.

979
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,140
那是不是几月前迈克・罗斯
And isn't it also true that Mike Ross

980
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,100
曾帮你婶婶获得一大笔和解金
got your aunt a large settlement several months ago,

981
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,690
如果他被判有罪
and if he gets convicted, it's likely

982
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,050
很可能那次和解会被推翻
that that settlement gets overturned?

983
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,560
反对  要求证人推测
Objection. Calls for speculation.

984
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,840
他是哈佛毕业的律师  他有能力做推测
He's a Harvard Lawyer. He's qualified to speculate.

985
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,660
-反对无效  -不  你说得对
- Overruled. - No, you're right.

986
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,630
和解可能被推翻
It'd probably get overturned,

987
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,410
但你要认为我说这些话是为那个
but if you think that's why I said what I said,

988
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,500
那你明显不了解我
then obviously you don't know me.

989
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,770
特雷弗・埃文斯可以因嫉妒而说谎
So Trevor Evans could lie because he's jealous,

990
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,150
你就不可能为婶婶而骗人吗
but you wouldn't lie for your aunt?

991
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,520
我不是为我婶婶说谎
I'm not lying for my aunt.

992
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,460
但你确实在说谎  因为说真话的人
But you are lying, because a person

993
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,050
绝对不会说自己在说谎
who's telling the truth wouldn't say they're lying at all.

994
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,540
反对  律师自行作证
Objection. Testifying.

995
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,800
法官大人  这位证人我问完了
You Honor, I've had enough of this witness.

996
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,900
他可以下庭了
He's excused.

997
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,110
公诉就此结束
And the prosecution rests.

998
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,910
唐娜
Donna.

999
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,390
进来
Come in.

1000
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,770
有什么需要帮忙的吗
What can I do for you?

1001
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,280
我其实是来见迈克的
I'm actually here to see Mike.

1002
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,290
迈克不在
Mike's not here.

1003
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,210
他去见哈维了
He went to go and see Harvey.

1004
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,490
-是关于...  -关于今天的事
- Look, is this about-- - It is about today.

1005
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,140
唐娜  我...
Donna, I--

1006
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,580
我总是说没什么能难住我
You know, I always talk like nothing can get to me.

1007
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,280
但今天我被难住了
Well, it did today.

1008
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,280
我在庭上崩溃了  伤到了迈克的案子
I crumbled up there, and I hurt Mike's case.

1009
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,200
我为自己而羞愧  而又不知道该怎么办
And I'm ashamed of myself, and I don't know what to do.

1010
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,950
好吧
Okay.

1011
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,180
没事  我告诉你应该做什么
Here's what you're gonna do. It's okay.

1012
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,130
你要跟我坐下来
You are going to sit down with me

1013
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,400
喝杯酒
and have a glass of wine

1014
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,360
放松
and relax.

1015
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,850
因为陪审团不傻  他们也不被允许
Because juries aren't stupid, and they aren't allowed

1016
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,570
受你说的话影响  所以他们不会被影响
to infer anything from what you said, so they won't.

1017
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,200
哈维  我得跟你说  我觉得我们搞定他们了
Harvey, I got to tell you, I think we got 'em.

1018
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,490
迈克  坐下
Mike, sit down.

1019
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,740
怎么了
What's going on?

1020
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,800
我们今天做得不错  但还不够
We had a good day, but it wasn't enough.

1021
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,760
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1022
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,840
-吉米出现  -迈克
- Jimmy came through. - Mike--

1023
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,900
我知道她打击到了他
Look, I know she landed a punch with him.

1024
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,140
我跟你说  他还不够
And I'm telling you, he wasn't enough.

1025
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,440
哈维  我们只需要合理怀疑就够了
Harvey, all we need is reasonable doubt.

1026
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,450
如果我在陪审团  我不会怀疑
And if I was on that jury, I wouldn't have it.

1027
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,380
我会认定你有罪
I'd find you guilty.

1028
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,870
很好  那你叫我来
That's great. So you just called me over here

1029
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,330
是要我自杀吗
to make me want to kill myself?

1030
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:52,070
我叫你来是因为这案子不是怀疑的事
I called you here because this is not about doubt.

1031
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,410
我们得给他们理由放过你
We need to give them a reason to want to let you go.

1032
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,570
那我们要怎么办
And how exactly are we gonna do that?

1033
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,060
做你一开始想做的事
By doing what you wanted to do in the first place.

1034
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,870
不  现在做
No. Now?

1035
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,110
你开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

1036
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,690
那是唯一让你不上证人席
It's the only way to get you to testify

1037
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:07,560
却可以作证的办法
without taking the stand.

1038
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,080
可你说如果必要  我们会让我作证
And you said if we had to, we'd put me on the stand.

1039
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
但你说对了
And you were right.

1040
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,070
她交叉询问太厉害了
She's too good at crossing.

1041
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,070
哈维  这是个好主意  我也希望我能做到
Well, it's a great idea, Harvey; I wish I'd had it.

1042
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,690
但问题是  他们不会允许我
The only problem is, they're not gonna let me change

1043
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,890
在庭审过程换律师的
my goddamn lawyer in the middle of a trial!

1044
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,560
那我说  我们得想办法
And I'm telling you we need to figure out

1045
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,980
让他们允许
a way to make them.

1046
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,910
因为如果我们想不出
Because if we don't...

1047
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,670
就会输
we're gonna lose.

1048
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,510
你不能跟我说话的
You're not allowed to talk to me.

1049
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,890
没错
That's true,

1050
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,120
但如果你谁都不告诉  就没人会知道
But if you don't tell anyone, then no one's gonna know,

1051
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,510
而我觉得你不会告诉别人的
and I don't think you're gonna want to tell anyone.

1052
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,940
好  你想要什么
Okay. What do you want?

1053
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,910
我得承认在你把希拉送走前
I have to admit that until you got rid of Sheila,

1054
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,140
我真的觉得你没参与这事的
I honestly thought you weren't part of this whole thing,

1055
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,980
但之后我做了个小调查
but then I did a little checking,

1056
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,960
发现我可以确切指出
and I think I can pinpoint the exact day

1057
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,940
你发现迈克・罗斯的事的日子
you found out about Mike Ross.

1058
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,220
我要给杰西卡打电话
I'm calling Jessica.

1059
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,050
他们让你辞职  你发现了迈克的事
They let you resign, you found out about Mike,

1060
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,320
就借此回去做上了命名合伙人
and you used it to return as a name partner.

1061
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,740
你知道那让我怎么看你吗
And you know what that makes me think about you?

1062
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,520
你有头脑  可能有点卑鄙
You're resourceful, maybe a little sleazy,

1063
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,110
但你一开始没雇那个孩子
but you didn't hire that kid in the first place.

1064
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,320
我不会背叛我的同伴
I'm not turning on my partners.

1065
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,200
你得通过敲诈他们得到你应得的
You had to blackmail them to get what you deserve.

1066
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,520
那肯定让你如鲠在喉
That's got to stick in your craw.

1067
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,560
-滚  -我会走  路易
- Go. - I will go, Louis.

1068
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,590
但你知道我在查你时
But you know what else I found out 

1069
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,080
发现了什么吗
when I was looking into you?

1070
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,610
你喜欢芭蕾
You like the ballet.

1071
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,570
喜欢做泥浴
You like to go mudding.

1072
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,310
你喜欢生活里的物质享受
You enjoy the creature comforts in life,

1073
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:44,250
但监狱里可没有那些
but they don't have comforts like that in prison.

1074
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,930
他们会输掉这场审判
They're gonna lose this trial.

1075
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:49,910
你知道  我知道  他们也知道
You know it, I know it, and they know it.

1076
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,150
你有最后一个自救的机会
You have one last chance to save yourself.

1077
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,990
好好考虑
Think about it.

1078
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,630
还有...
And, uh...

1079
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:57,970
打电话给我
Call me.

1080
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,320
以免太迟了
Before it's too late.

1081
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,570
