{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on Suits

22
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,560
帕默发现我们在跟赛德尔合作了
Palmer figured out that we're doing this with Seidel.

23
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,880
除非我们撤诉
And unless we drop the lawsuit,

24
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,380
否则他要告我们合谋
he's gonna come after us for collusion.

25
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,530
如果我通过听证  帕默就动不了我们
If I pull out of that hearing, Palmer can't touch us.

26
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,430
但如果你不告诉纳森到底发生了什么的话
I'm not doing anything until 

27
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,320
我什么也不做了
you tell Nathan exactly what's going on. 

28
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,400
没什么好说的了
There's nothing to tell.

29
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,430
你说你接这个案子是为了重新当律师
You said you're doing this case as a way to get into the Bar.

30
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,010
我刚刚撤回了我的申请
And I just withdrew my application.

31
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,360
迈克被捕前我就知道他的诈骗行为
I knew Mike was a fraud before he was arrested.

32
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,280
还利用这事当上了冠名合伙人
I leveraged it to get my name on the wall.

33
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,990
我以为至少我知道你的为人
I thought I knew what kind of man you were.

34
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,250
你怎么敢这么说我
How dare you say that to me

35
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,780
我们第一次上床时
when the first time we slept together,

36
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,100
你还跟别人好着呢
you were with another man.

37
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,800
我不愿意和一个放弃了梦想的人
I don't want to spend the rest of my life

38
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,540
过一辈子
with a man who gave up on his dreams,

39
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,090
而且我知道你也不愿意当那个人
and I know that you don't want to be that man either.

40
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,170
我们有证据能证明超过一打的
We have proof of over a dozen instances

41
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,810
商业间谍行为
of you committing corporate espionage.

42
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,730
你们想要什么
What do you want?

43
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,060
跟那些矿工和解
You're gonna settle with those miners.

44
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,540
忘记听说过我们的事
You're gonna forget you ever heard of us.

45
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,290
并且继续诚实履行跟克雷格・塞德尔
And you're gonna honor your original agreement

46
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,260
原本达成的协议
with Craig Seidel.

47
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,650
我不仅想让你敲定听证
I don't just want you to set that hearing.

48
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,660
还想让你帮我清除掉所有拦路的人
I want you to bulldoze anyone who stands in my way.

49
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,760
几点了
What time is it?

50
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,510
别担心  你上班没迟到
Don't worry. You're not late for work.

51
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,850
-给  -谢谢
- Here. - Thanks.

52
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,730
我真需要这个
I could use this.

53
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,670
昨晚很晚才回来
I got in pretty late last night.

54
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,540
那跟我刚在厨房里发现的花
Does that have anything to do with the flowers

55
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,950
有关吗
I just found in the kitchen?

56
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,720
我就不能单纯因为爱你而给你买花吗
Can't a guy just buy you flowers 'cause he loves you?

57
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,540
是能  但不是这样的
He can. But he didn't.

58
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,840
你说对了
You're right.

59
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,310
我买花是为了感谢你
I bought them to say thank you

60
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,440
不惜一切来确保
for doing whatever it took to make sure

61
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,440
我能有机会成为律师
I got my shot at getting into the Bar.

62
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,850
等等  那么说
Wait, does that mean that...

63
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,270
是啊  我们做到了
Yeah. We did it.

64
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,020
我的听证会就在明天  赛德尔站在我们这边
My hearing's tomorrow. Seidel's on our side.

65
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,610
难以置信
I can't believe it.

66
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,930
这可能成真了
This could really happen.

67
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,920
是啊
I know.

68
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,250
怎么了
What is it?

69
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,360
我答应奥利佛会告诉纳森
I promised Oliver that I would tell Nathan

70
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,400
整件事的来龙去脉
about the whole thing.

71
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,750
-迈克  你不能那么做  -我知道
- Mike, you can't do that. - I know I can't.

72
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,340
但我得为听证会请几天的假
But I gotta get a couple days off for the hearing,

73
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,140
那么我总得给他个交待
which means I gotta tell him something.

74
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,710
路易  你来做什么
Louis, what are you doing here?

75
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,120
希望你不介意我过来
I hope you don't mind I stopped by.

76
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,990
我必须见你
I had to see you.

77
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,350
我昨晚一夜睡不着
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

78
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,240
-我也是  -塔拉  求你
- Neither could I. - Tara, please.

79
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,320
我知道我们吵架了
I know we had a fight,

80
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,930
但你说你想了解我
but you told me you wanted to get to know me.

81
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,600
我发誓  我告诉你的
And I swear, what I told you

82
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,230
是我做过的最坏的事
was the worst thing I've ever done.

83
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,370
路易  我难以接受的
Louis, the thing I'm having trouble dealing with

84
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,280
跟你们公司那个人的事无关
has nothing to do with that person at your firm.

85
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,740
而是你昨晚对我的态度
It has to do with how you treated me last night.

86
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,400
-塔拉  求你  -让我说完
- Tara, please. - Let me finish.

87
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,090
你对我说了很吓人的事
You shared something horrible with me,

88
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,940
又没给我时间接受
gave me no time to process it,

89
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,230
然后我还在消化这事的时候
and while I was taking it in,

90
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,600
你不仅攻击了我的人品
you not only attacked my integrity,

91
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,950
还让我为自己感到羞耻
you made me feel ashamed of myself.

92
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,700
你是对的
You're right.

93
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,560
我发火了  我不该的
I lashed out, and I shouldn't have.

94
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,060
但我那么做是因为担心你跟我分手
But I only did it because I was afraid of you rejecting me.

95
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,840
我...
And I will...

96
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,890
塔拉  如果你跟我分手我会死的
Tara, I'll die if you reject me.

97
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,810
问题就在这里  路易
That's the thing, Louis.

98
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,170
你是有理由做出那样的反应
You had a reason for reacting the way you did.

99
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,930
但我不确定我想跟一个
But I'm not sure I want to be with a man

100
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,540
认为他有任何理由那么对待我的男人在一起
who thinks there's ever a reason to treat me that way.

101
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,050
-塔拉  -对不起  路易
- Tara... - I'm sorry, Louis.

102
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,740
他们还在会议室等我呢
They're waiting for me in the conference room.

103
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,400
我说过我会打给你
I told you I'll call,

104
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,780
我会的
and I will call.

105
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,400
-纳森  -迈克  怎么了
- Nathan. - Mike. What's up?

106
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,920
没事  就想给你这个
Nothing. I just wanted to give you this.

107
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,040
这是五万美金的支票
This is a check for $50,000.

108
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,420
是啊  我们和解了
I know. We settled.

109
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,130
我昨晚把支票都给矿工了
I gave the miners their checks last night.

110
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,390
迈克  我们一个案子从未赚过这么多钱
Mike, this is the most money we've ever made on a case.

111
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,800
我们终于不用担心交不起房租了
For once, we're not gonna have to worry about making rent.

112
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,480
是啊
Yeah. Right.

113
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,580
我不是说笑
That's not a joke.

114
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,580
等等  你是说五万美金
Wait, you're telling me that $50,000

115
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,380
对于诊所会那么重要吗
can really make that big a difference to the clinic?

116
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,760
我是说  我知道在公司法里
I'm telling you that I know in corporate law,

117
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,790
钱都是按百万算的
money doesn't matter unless it's in the millions, but...

118
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,520
但在这里  五万美金就是天文数字了
here, $50,000 makes all the difference in the world.

119
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,030
那样的话  纳森  我从来这儿工作
Well, in that case, Nathan, I've been working here

120
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,610
就一直没休息过
seven days a week since I started,

121
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,330
我有私事要去处理
and I've got some personal stuff that I need to--

122
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,570
打住  你刚给我拿到了30天的租金
Stop right there. Look. You just bought me 30 days rent.

123
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,270
让你放几天假也是应该的
The least I can do is give you a few days back.

124
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
太好了  谢谢
Great. Thank you.

125
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,710
谢谢你
Thank you.

126
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,600
-好了  说吧  -说什么
- Okay, let's hear it. - Hear what?

127
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,480
你想了一早上的段子
The joke you spent all morning coming up with.

128
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,160
什么段子
What joke?

129
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,000
我刚想问你法律图书馆怎么样
I was just gonna ask you where the law library was,

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
但随即意识到你从未去过
but then I realized you've never set foot in there.

131
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,620
你难道不该在诊所里拯救鲸鱼吗
Shouldn't you be at the clinic saving whales?

132
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,150
首先  那是绿色和平的事
First of all, that's Greenpeace.

133
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,020
其次  我请了假
And second of all, I took the day off

134
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,060
好准备应付品行考核委员会
so I could prepare for the Character and Fitness Committee.

135
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,200
那么你是要严肃对待
Oh, that means you're taking

136
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,960
不管会发生的什么岔子了
whatever that hitch is gonna be seriously.

137
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,000
-当然了  -这就对了
- You know I am. - That's what I like to hear.

138
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,600
因为我不希望在这里工作的人
Because I don't want somebody working here

139
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,280
不听取我的建议
who doesn't listen to my advice.

140
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,510
哈维  我觉得你还是不明白
Harvey, I still don't think you understand.

141
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,910
等这事结束  我不会回来的
When this thing is over, I am not coming back here.

142
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,100
-迈克  -我说过  我想做好事
- Mike-- - I told you, I want to do good.

143
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,000
-那就在这儿做好事  -我还说过
- Then do good here. - And I also told you

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,610
我当初之所以答应了这件事
that the only reason I agreed to this whole thing in the first place 

145
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,480
是因为我不忍心
was because I couldn't stand

146
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,050
看奥利佛那样的人失败
to watch someone like Oliver fail

147
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,450
而又无法帮助他
and not be able to help him.

148
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,580
而奥利佛那类人又不在这样的地方工作
and people like Oliver don't work in places like this.

149
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,040
他们在那样的地方工作
They work in places like that.

150
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,030
而你这类人不应该被允许在任何地方工作
And people like you shouldn't be working anywhere.

151
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,310
你来这里干什么  安妮塔
What are you doing here, Anita?

152
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,830
我来这里是因为联邦检察官办公室要求
I'm here because the U.S. Attorney's Office requested that

153
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,560
一旦迈克・罗斯申请要成为律师  必须通知他们
they be notified if Mike Ross ever applied to the Bar.

154
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,030
联邦检察官办公室和迈克有什么关系
What does the U.S. Attorney's Office have to do with Mike?

155
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,280
没关系  只是我碰巧在那里工作而已
Nothing. Except I happen to work there.

156
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,640
而且一周以前
And as of one week ago,

157
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,780
我还成为了品行考核委员会的新成员
I'm also the newest member of the Character and Fitness Committee.

158
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,420
放屁
Bullshit.

159
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,080
要走完一整套程序才能加入那个委员会
There's a whole process to get on that committee.

160
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,190
你不可能正好在走那个程序
There's no way you just happened to be in the pipeline.

161
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,510
没错  我的确没有
You're right. I wasn't.

162
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,950
但一旦有成员卸任
But when a member takes leave,

163
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,240
他有权任命他的接班人
he has the right to appoint his replacement.

164
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,870
而沃特・山姆森委任了我
And Walter Samson appointed me.

165
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,260
你以为我不会挖出
You think I'm not gonna find out

166
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,580
你是动了什么手脚才让这人让位的吗
whatever bullshit you did to get this guy to drop out?

167
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,410
随便挖
Be my guest,

168
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,090
因为假如迈克要去参加那个听证会
because if Mike is going before that hearing,

169
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,910
那意味着你一定也动了手脚
that means you did something too.

170
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,640
你想怎样
What do you want?

171
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,170
我想告诉你  你可以取消这次听证
I want to tell you you might as well cancel this hearing,

172
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,820
为我们大家都节省许多时间
save us all a lot of time.

173
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,930
因为必须全票通过才算通过
Because the vote has to be unanimous.

174
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,720
而我绝对不会投通过的
And you are never getting my vote.

175
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,310
{\an8}诉讼双雄
第六季第十六集[季终]

176
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,970
瑞秋  无论你在做什么  都得先放一放
Rachel, whatever you're doing, you need to put it down

177
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,640
然后开始找在没有全票通过的情况下
and start looking for every single instance

178
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,570
一个人依然获得了律师资格的案例
where a person was admitted to the Bar and the vote wasn't unanimous.

179
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,420
迈克  出什么事了
Mike, what's going on?

180
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,990
安妮塔・吉布斯加入了委员会
Anita Gibbs got herself onto the board.

181
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,130
那我们该做的是找个办法把她踢出去
Then what we should be doing is finding a way to get her kicked off.

182
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,320
哈维在想办法了  但与此同时
Harvey's working on it. But in the meantime,

183
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,130
我需要了解关于这个委员会的一切细节
I need to know the ins and outs of this committee,

184
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,180
因为只要她还在委员会里
because while she's on it,

185
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,780
她就会用尽一切肮脏的手段
she's gonna use every dirty trick in the book

186
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,270
试图把这件事直接扼杀在摇篮里的
to end this thing before it gets started.

187
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,130
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

188
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,640
我要窝在图书馆里
I'm gonna go hole myself up in the library

189
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,300
为回答每一个我能想到的肮脏问题做准备
and start preparing answers to every dirty question i can think of.

190
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,440
路易  你还好吗
Louis, are you okay?

191
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,860
我没事  唐娜
I'm fine, Donna.

192
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,870
有什么需要我帮忙的吗
What can I do for you?

193
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,760
我知道你知道本杰明和我正在创业
I know you know Benjamin and I have been working on a business.

194
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,530
但我不确定你是否知道
But I'm not sure that you know

195
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,500
我们找了斯图做投资人
that we brought on Stu as an investor.

196
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,790
我不知道  唐娜  那真是太棒了
I didn't, Donna; That's great.

197
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,320
的确
It is.

198
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,210
但出了个问题  而我需要你的帮助
But there's a problem, and I need your help with it.

199
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:09,820
你尽管开口
Anything.

200
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,340
本杰明去申请了专利
Benjamin applied for a patent,

201
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,660
但发现我们的技术和另一个人的重合了
and it turns out that our technology overlaps with someone else's.

202
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,780
-重合度有多高  -32.5%
- How much overlap? - 32.5%.

203
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,010
超过最高限度了
That's over the threshold.

204
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,690
除非本杰明能把重合度降到30...
Unless Benjamin can get you below 30--

205
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,220
他做不到
He can't.

206
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,880
但斯图说我们可以和那个专利持有人协商
But Stu says we can negotiate with whoever holds the patent,

207
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,170
让他们授权给我们
get them to give us an exclusion,

208
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,470
那我们就可以继续推进真・唐娜这个项目了
and we'll still be able to move forward with The Donna.

209
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,470
唐娜  我正需要这个
Donna, this is exactly what I need.

210
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,820
什么意思
What do you mean?

211
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,670
塔拉和我大吵了一架
Tara and I got into a huge fight.

212
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,170
她如今正在决定我们还要不要继续
She's deciding right now if we're gonna stay together.

213
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,340
我正需要做点什么来转移注意力
This is exactly what I needed to take my mind off it.

214
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,730
路易  我不想让自己听起来不近人情
Louis, I don't mean to sound insensitive,

215
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,790
但这事对我而言真的很重要
but this is incredibly important to me.

216
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,420
我了解你
I know you,

217
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,890
假如你的状态会让你把这件事搞砸
and if this is gonna make you go in there and blow this thing up,

218
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,740
我不接受那种结果
I can't have that.

219
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,060
唐娜  听我说
Donna, listen to me.

220
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,080
我也许会失去我生命中最亲近的女人
I may be losing the closest woman in my life,

221
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,750
但你是第二亲近的
but you are the second closest.

222
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,620
我发誓我不会做任何危害你的公司的事
I swear that I won't do anything to harm your company.

223
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,900
谢谢  搞定这件事
Thank you. knock on the head

224
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,650
你什么时候才打算告诉我
When were you gonna tell me?

225
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,450
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

226
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,600
那个把迈克送进监狱的检察官
That the prosecutor that put Mike in prison

227
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,480
把自己弄进了委员会
just got herself put on that panel.

228
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,640
-什么  -没错
- What? - That's right.

229
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,200
而我想知道我为什么没有从你这里听说这件事
And I want to know why I heard about it from her and not you.

230
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,630
我告诉你为什么  因为我不知道
I'll tell you why. Because I didn't know.

231
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,080
但如今我知道了  这件事玩完了
But now that I do, this thing is done.

232
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,820
-玩完个屁  -你疯了吗
- The hell it is. - Are you crazy?

233
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,900
安妮塔・吉布斯可是助理联邦检察官
Anita Gibbs is a goddamn Assistant U.S. Attorney.

234
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,990
一旦她发现了一丁点迹象
She gets one whiff of this,

235
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,390
我俩都会被吊销律师执照的
and we are both disbarred.

236
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,830
所以我们要把她踢出委员会
Which is why we're gonna make sure that doesn't happen

237
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,780
以确保这件事不会发生
by getting her kicked off that panel.

238
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,310
我们要怎样才能做到那一点
And how exactly are we gonna do that?

239
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,630
你先把所有我需要知道的
We're gonna start by you telling me

240
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,560
关于沃特・山姆森的事  仔仔细细地告诉我
everything there is to know about Walter Samson.

241
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,040
那我们现在一样也可以放弃了
Well, then we might as well give up right now,

242
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,350
因为沃特・山姆森是清白的
because Walter Samson is as clean as they come.

243
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,230
-没有人是那么清白的  -这个人就是
- No one is that clean. - Well, this guy is.

244
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,750
-而且我没有...  -听我说
- And I didn't sign on-- - Listen to me.

245
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,870
你说过你加入的
You said you were in on this.

246
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,610
我现在告诉你  你依旧是我们这条船上的
And I'm telling you right now, you still are.

247
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,340
因为我们千方百计地帮你摆脱了麻烦
Because we moved heaven and earth to get you out of hot water,

248
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,720
我可不介意把你重新打入地狱
and I got no problem putting you right back in.

249
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,140
好
Fine.

250
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,910
但你最好小心一点
But you better be careful.

251
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,300
因为如果你想调查吉布斯
Because if you're looking at Gibbs,

252
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,490
她也会调查我们
she's going to be looking at us.

253
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,500
而你大白天来我的大堂找我
And you coming to my lobby in the middle of the day

254
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,780
就会让她抓住把柄
is going to get us all caught.

255
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,860
先生们  虽然是临时通知
Gentlemen, thank you for meeting with me

256
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,360
-感谢你们愿意见我  -不客气
- on such short notice. - Our pleasure.

257
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
我想你们应该已经看过我发给你们的文件了
I assume you looked through the documents I sent over

258
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,730
合二位心意吗
and found them to your liking?

259
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,950
正相反  我们感到非常不爽
On the contrary, we found them most disturbing.

260
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,360
具体地说  你们是使用了
In particular, the fact that you used

261
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,010
我们的基本原则才能够完成设计
our fundamental principles and worked up from there.

262
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:28,700
什么
What?

263
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,500
我们在申请专利前
We've never even seen your fundamental principles

264
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,740
从未看过你们的基本原则
prior to applying for that patent.

265
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,790
你能证明吗
Can you prove that?

266
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,490
当然没法证明
Of course we can't... prove that.

267
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,490
没法证明没看过
It's not possible to prove a negative.

268
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,220
每个将别人的技术
Words spoken by every hack who's ever copied

269
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,180
窃为己有的人都会这么说
someone else's technology and claimed it as their own.

270
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,300
什么情况
What's going on here?

271
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,940
我诚心诚意地来谈授权
I came to you to negotiate an exclusion in good faith.

272
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,910
我们计划报价
And we're prepared to offer you--

273
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,500
我们不关心你们的报价
We don't care what you're prepared to offer.

274
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,610
我们让你来也不是要给你提供授权
And we didn't bring you here to give you an exclusion.

275
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,400
而是要借你传达个消息
We brought you here to send a message.

276
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,360
这是起诉你委托人的文件  要求赔偿九千万
This is a $90 million lawsuit against your client

277
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,600
如果他们让产品上市的话
if they go to market.

278
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,590
二位  别这样
Gentlemen, please,

279
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,230
我不是说我们先发明的
I am not saying we got here first.

280
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,400
但只是超过了2.5%
But it's a 2.5% overlap,

281
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,360
而我们愿意支付15%的收益分成
and we are open to a 15% revenue sharing arrangement.

282
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,850
我们根本不在乎  因为是我们在先
And we're not open to shit, because we were here first.

283
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,690
听好了  我在尽量克制了
Listen to me. I am trying to keep my cool.

284
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,570
我们不管你能否克制
We don't care if you keep your cool or not.

285
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,380
因为我们抓住你了
Because we've got you,

286
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,990
而你却无能为力
and there's nothing you can do about it.

287
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,390
你可以把你的报价塞进抽屉里了
So you can take your offer and shove it in a drawer

288
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,450
还有那个拿来做借口的电子秘书
along with that sorry excuse for a digital secretary,

289
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,490
因为两者没有一个能见天日
because neither one of them is ever gonna see the light of day.

290
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,140
奥利佛  你干什么呢
Oliver. What are you doing?

291
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,000
还有效吗
Is it still on?

292
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,340
-什么还有效吗  -你的交易
- Is what still on? - Your deal.

293
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,300
成为律师
To get into the Bar.

294
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,060
奥利佛  听我说
Oliver, listen to me.

295
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,390
因为当我问内森你去哪儿了
Because when I asked Nathan where you were,

296
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,760
他说你要请几天假处理私事
he said you were taking a couple days for personal reasons.

297
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,070
突然之间  我就感到
And all of a sudden, I got this

298
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,540
挥之不去的恶心
pit in my stomach that wouldn't go away.

299
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,450
于是我决定来问问你我是否有理由恶心
So I decided to ask you if there's a reason I got that pit

300
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,590
或者我只不过是个怀疑你的混蛋
or if I'm just an asshole for doubting you.

301
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,490
你不是混蛋  奥利佛
You're not an asshole, Oliver.

302
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,430
该死的  迈克
God damn it, Mike!

303
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,080
你跟我说过  你不会告诉内森
You told me you didn't have to tell Nathan

304
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,090
因为无事可说
because there was nothing to tell.

305
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,860
我和你说的时候的确是那样
And when I told you that, there wasn't.

306
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,340
后来我的交易又回到了桌面上
But then my deal got put back on the table.

307
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,000
也就是说今天早上你本可以告诉他
Which means you could have told him this morning.

308
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,180
而你没有  现在我得去说了
But you didn't, so now I have to.

309
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,290
奥利佛  等等  拜托听我说
Oliver, hey, wait! Please, hear me out!

310
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,720
我才不听你说  迈克
I'm not gonna hear you out, Mike.

311
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,310
我在这里等了你一个小时  希望是我看错你了
I was sitting here for an hour, hoping I was wrong about you.

312
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,640
你没看错我
You weren't wrong about me.

313
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,370
我在乎人们  我希望能帮助诊所
I care about people. I want to help the clinic.

314
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,150
我之所以没告诉内森
And the reason I didn't tell Nathan what I did

315
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,550
是因为我想等我有能力帮他更多的时候再说
is because I'm just waiting until I can help him even more.

316
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,110
怎么帮  做一个见不得人的律师吗
Help how? By being a shady lawyer?

317
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,520
做一个不会让索菲亚・普莱斯丢掉房子的人
By being someone who wouldn't have lost Sofia Price her home.

318
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,600
真不相信你会说出这句话
I cannot believe you just said that to me.

319
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,170
因为这是事实  你也清楚
I said it because it's true, and you know it.

320
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,400
我的听证会一结束
Look, I am gonna tell Nathan everything

321
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,120
我就马上把事情都告诉内森  我向你保证
as soon as my hearing is over. You have my word.

322
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,760
我凭什么要相信骗子的话
Why should I believe the word of a liar?

323
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,390
就凭我为那些矿工和诊所所做的事情
Because of what I did for those miners and the clinic.

324
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,710
如果这些还不够  我为你做的可以吗
And if that's not enough, how about what I did for you?

325
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,920
你屁都没为我做  但我不会告诉内森
You didn't do shit for me. But fine, I won't tell Nathan.

326
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,530
只要这件事情一结束
Just so long as when this thing's over,

327
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,570
你就滚回你的狗屁商业界
you go back to your corrupt corporate world.

328
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,310
因为不管你告诉自己什么
Because I don't care what you tell yourself.

329
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,660
我永远都不会认可你
You're never gonna belong in mine.

330
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,890
哈维  还在这儿干什么
Harvey, what are you still doing here?

331
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,960
听证会在城市对角  十分钟就开始了
The hearing's across town in ten minutes.

332
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,330
我不去听证会了  唐娜  你也不要去
I'm not going to the hearing, Donna, and neither are you.

333
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,230
-为什么  -因为如果我们俩做不到该做的事
- Why not? - Because if you and I can't do

334
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,750
不管迈克在听证会上怎么表现
what we need to, then whatever Mike does at that hearing

335
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,150
-都无所谓了  -告诉我
- isn't gonna matter. - Give it to me.

336
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,600
我们得找到沃特・山姆森的弱点
We need to figure out what Walter Samson's weak spot is.

337
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,950
告诉我该怎么做  我全力以赴
Tell me how, and I'm all in.

338
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,010
从联系所有认识他的人
Start by contacting every person we know

339
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,950
问问他们知道这个混蛋有什么事情开始
and asking them what they know about this asshole.

340
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,710
因为吉布斯握有他的把柄
Because Gibbs has something on him

341
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,330
如果我找不出来
and if I can't find out what it is,

342
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,050
我就没法把她踢出委员会
then I can't get her off that committee.

343
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,410
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

344
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,970
去见一个根本不认识山姆森的人
To see someone who doesn't know Samson at all.

345
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,690
在开始之前  我要指出
Before we get started, I'd like to point out

346
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,930
此类访谈通常是为了我们快速批准
these interviews are normally for us to quickly approve

347
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,320
标准申请人进入律师协会
standard applicants to the Bar.

348
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,760
但是  罗斯先生并非完全符合申请人标准
However, Mr. Ross is no standard applicant.

349
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,910
所以  我们将不对他的审核环节限时
Therefore, we will convene for as long as it takes

350
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,990
直到得出判定结果
before ruling on his application.

351
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,860
-现在  -主席先生  请允许我发言
- Now... - Mr. Chairman, if I may.

352
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,860
去年冬天  罗斯先生认罪
Last winter, Mr. Ross pled guilty

353
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,850
承认其对纽约市民犯下了欺诈罪
to defrauding the citizens of New York.

354
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,020
所以  我提议立刻拒绝他的申请
Therefore, I propose we reject his application right now

355
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,460
因为罗斯先生是罪犯
because Mr. Ross is a felon

356
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,040
纽约律师协会不接受罪犯
and the New York Bar does not accept felons.

357
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,760
主席先生  我无意冒犯这位协会的新成员
Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the new board member,

358
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,510
但有过接受先例的
you do.

359
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,270
而且协会不仅接受罪犯  多年前更是
Not only does the Bar accept felons, but years ago,

360
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,200
此协会认可了尼尔・维斯纳
this very committee admitted Neal Wiesner,

361
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,330
一个因谋杀未遂入狱多年的罪犯
a man who spent years in prison for attempted murder.

362
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,220
吉布斯小姐也许觉得我的罪行
Now, Ms. Gibbs may think my crime is worse

363
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,670
甚至比谋杀未遂更恶劣  但我不认为
than attempted murder, but I don't think

364
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,890
就恶劣到值得协会放弃140多年的先例
it's worth throwing away 140 years of precedent

365
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,790
甚至不给我一个为自己说话的机会
by not even allowing me to make my case.

366
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,690
加油啊  快跑
Come on, let's go.

367
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,740
你干什么呢
What the hell are you doing?

368
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,160
你看我像在干什么
What does it look likeI'm doing?

369
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,620
眼睁睁看着我的钱打了水漂
I'm watching my money go down the toilet.

370
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,440
在我看来是我给了你一个任务
Well, it looks to me like I paid you to do a job,

371
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,000
你却坐在这里无所事事
and you're sitting here doing this.

372
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,740
好吧  我就告诉你一个小秘密
Okay, I'll let you in on a little secret.

373
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,050
电脑入侵只需要十五分钟
It only takes 15 minutes to hack someone.

374
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,060
接下来的45分钟里要是找不到有用的事
If you can't find something in the next 45,

375
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,350
就说明它根本不存在
it means there's nothing to find.

376
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,070
胡扯  肯定有什么的
Bullshit. There's always something to find.

377
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,640
我说实话  真没有
I'm telling you, there isn't.

378
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,990
他不碰烟酒不赌不偷  不沾坏事
He doesn't drink, smoke, gamble, cheat, nothing.

379
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,800
给我听好  我给了你一大笔钱搞定这事
Listen to me. I paid you good money to do a job,

380
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,440
如果你不给我认真点
and if you don't put some more effort into this,

381
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,650
我就会把你一无是处的事广而告之
I'm gonna spread the word that you aren't worth shit.

382
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,020
而这次不再是路易・利特没信誉的话
And this time it won't be coming from Louis Litt.

383
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,080
-而是我的  -那把你的臭钱拿走
- It'll be coming from me. - Then keep your damn money.

384
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,370
当我告诉你找不到什么的时候
When I tell you there's nothing to find,

385
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,640
就是真的不存在
there's nothing to find.

386
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,600
我的意思是我不仅承认我的所作所为
I guess what I'm saying is not only do I admit what I did,

387
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,690
而且  我很后悔
but... I regret it

388
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,570
诚心诚意的后悔
with every fiber of my being.

389
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,000
我愿意向我的委托人们
And I'd like to apologize to my clients,

390
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,600
向我的前同事们
my former colleagues, 

391
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,100
向从我是个孩子起  就一直想
and finally to the fraternity of men and woman

392
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,770
加入的协会的兄弟姐妹们
that I've wanted to be a member of

393
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,590
真诚致歉
since I was a child.

394
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,550
真是感人的陈述
Well, that was a moving statement.

395
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,160
我就一个问题
I just have one question.

396
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,810
要是你这么后悔你的所作所为
If you regret what you did so much,

397
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,030
你为什么不愿意服满刑期
why weren't you willing to serve your full sentence?

398
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,380
我没有不愿意
Well, I wasn't unwilling. 

399
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,340
有人提出交易  让我帮忙给某罪犯定罪
I was offered a deal to help convict a known criminal,

400
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,170
我就答应了
and I took it.

401
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,680
你是答应了一个能提前被释放的交易
You were offered a deal to get out early, and you took it.

402
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,280
我保护了一个无辜的人...
I protected an innocent man--

403
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,210
你所做的不过是渗入你室友的生活
What you did was insinuate yourself into your roommate's life,

404
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,080
获得他的信任
gain his trust,

405
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,350
假装自己是他的朋友  是否如此
and pretend to be his friend. True or false?

406
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,460
你这纯粹是断章取义
You're taking it out of context.

407
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,690
要说全部事实就是你说自己是一回事
The context is you portrayed yourself as one thing

408
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,970
而其实是另一回事
when, really, you were another,

409
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,590
而这正是你谎称自己是律师的
which is what you did the entire time

410
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,140
整个过程中干的
you pretended to be an attorney

411
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,010
也是我认为你现在正在做的事
and what I believe you are doing to this body right now.

412
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,970
主席先生
Mr. Chairmen, 

413
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,220
如果她在他陈述中就对他的人格进行抨击
if she's going to impugn his character while he's speaking,

414
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,520
那他就有权找人为他作证
then he's entitled to let someone else speak for him.

415
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,720
这不是庭审
This isn't a trial.

416
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,460
我们不允许品性证人发言
We don't allow character witnesses here.

417
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,540
事实上  协会允许
Actually, you do.

418
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,530
第四章16A款规定
Article 4, 16A.

419
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,760
申请人允许请证人出席
Applicants are allowed a witness as a rebuttal

420
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,730
反驳由协会成员提出的指控
for an accusation leveled by a committee member.

421
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,190
那条规定已经30年没用过了
That article hasn't been cited in 30 years.

422
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,410
也许是因为从来没有申请人被迫
Maybe that's because no applicant has ever had to stand

423
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,830
由送自己进监狱的人品评过
before the person who put them away.

424
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,200
有道理
You make a point.

425
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,680
我们明天一早听取你找到的
We'll pick this up first thing in the morning

426
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,600
证人的陈述  谢谢
with your witness. Thank you.

427
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,720
瑞秋  你的话帮了我大忙
Rachel, that was exactly what I needed.

428
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,880
-要不是你...  -我知道
- If you hadn't done that... - I know.

429
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,150
但现在我更担心的是
But right now I'm more concerned with the fact

430
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,900
她会让成员们讨厌你
that she's turning them against you.

431
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,670
也就是说即使哈维拉她下马
Which means even after Harvey kicks her off,

432
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,010
赛德尔要说服所有人也难上加难了
Seidel's job is gonna be that much harder.

433
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,770
而我们只有机会找一个人替我说话
And we only have one shot at having someone speak for me.

434
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,570
迈克  走吧  我们得赶紧回公司
Mike, come on. We gotta get back to the office

435
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,410
开始思考谁能做这件事
and start going through everyone it could be.

436
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,050
从正反两方面列个对比表格
We'll make a list of pros and cons.

437
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,980
瑞秋  我知道该找谁
Rachel... I know who it is.

438
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,240
朱利叶斯
Julius.

439
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,000
迈克  你怎么来了
Mike. What are you doing here?

440
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,440
我想找你谈谈
I was hoping we could talk.

441
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,400
抱歉  伙计  现在不方便
Look, I'm sorry, man. This is not a good time.

442
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,920
我刚把孩子哄睡着  我和妻子正...
I just put the baby down and the wife and I--

443
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,530
求你  不用很久的
Please, it won't take long.

444
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,940
明天我有场听证会
I got this hearing tomorrow

445
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,310
是律师协会的品行考核
for the Character portion of the Bar,

446
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,440
我想问你愿不愿意替我说话
and I wanted to ask if you'd speak for me.

447
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,220
你不介意我问下  为什么找我
You mind if I ask, why me?

448
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,740
因为你是我认识的人中唯一一个有资格
Because you're the only one I know who's qualified

449
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,170
告诉委员会我出来之后
to tell the board that I was a different man

450
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,510
已经不是以前那个人了
when I got out than when I went in.

451
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,660
无意冒犯  迈克
No offense, Mike...

452
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,560
但事实上  我不确定你是否改过自新了
but the truth is, I'm not sure you are.

453
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,260
什么意思
What do you mean?

454
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,950
我是说这个听证会在明天
I mean you said this hearing is tomorrow.

455
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,280
而你现在才来找我
But you're just now coming to me,

456
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,540
这意味着出了什么状况
which means something's going on.

457
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,100
状况就是把我抓起来的那个女人
What's going on is the woman who put me away

458
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,530
又要进入听证委员会
managed to get herself on the committee,

459
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,200
而今她又当面挑衅我
and now she's slamming the door in my face.

460
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,650
-那她为什么要这么做  -朱利叶斯
- And why would she do that? - Julius--

461
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,670
迈克  你怎么会有听证会
Mike, how did you even get a hearing?

462
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,240
你说什么呢  我跟别人一样申请了
What are you talking about? I applied, like everyone else.

463
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,040
不  你跟别人不一样
No, you're not like everyone else.

464
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,000
-你都没上过法学院  -那不重要
- You didn't go to law school. - It doesn't matter.

465
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,540
有个例外叫"熟读法律"
There's an exception called "Reading the law."

466
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,700
发现了吗迈克  就这
See, right there, Mike,

467
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,170
听起来就像我在监狱里遇到的胡扯的骗子一样
that sounds like the bullshit artist I met in prison.

468
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,670
那你现在告诉我
So you tell me right now.

469
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,870
你是不是搞了什么事才弄到的听证会
Did you pull some shit to make this happen?

470
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,110
该死迈克  如果你不跟我坦白
Damn, Mike, if you can't be straight with me,

471
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,310
我就立马结束谈话
this conversation ends right here.

472
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,140
好吧  我承认
Yes, I did.

473
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,760
还是啊  夜幕下的真相
Finally. Some truth in the night.

474
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,460
朱利叶斯  我在一家法律诊所工作
Julius, I work at a law clinic,

475
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,470
但不是以律师身份
but not as a lawyer.

476
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,710
我曾有一个成为律师的机会摆在眼前
An opportunity presented itself for me to become one

477
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,600
而我拒绝了
and I turned it down, 

478
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,670
然后我不得不坐在那
but then I had to sit there

479
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,770
眼睁睁看着一个女人因为我帮不上忙
and watch a woman get put on the street

480
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,260
而被赶到大街上
because I couldn't help her.

481
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,180
我知道我会一次又一次地
And I knew I'd have to watch that happen

482
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,920
看到这种情况
over and over and over.

483
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,340
所以当那个机会第二次出现时
So when that opportunity presented itself for the second time,

484
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,400
我想要抓住它
I took it.

485
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,820
因为我知道它如果消失就不会再来
Because I knew it would never come along again.

486
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,480
-你也不知道会怎么样  迈克  -我知道
- You don't know that, Mike. - I do know that.

487
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,380
所以你愿意的话可以拒绝
So you can say no if you want to,

488
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,290
但不能说我没有改变
but don't say I haven't changed.

489
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,480
因为你那晚在监狱遇到的迈克
Because the Mike you met that night in prison

490
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,620
永远不会像刚才那样对你说出真相
never would have told you the truth just now.

491
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,960
朱利叶斯  拜托了
Julius, please.

492
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,540
我需要这个机会
I need this.

493
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,980
这是地址
This is the address.

494
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,920
明早八点
It's tomorrow at 9:00.

495
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,230
我没有别人可找了
I don't have anyone else.

496
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,150
迈克
Mike, hey.

497
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,130
哈维  告诉我你有些好消息
Harvey, tell me you got some good news.

498
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,880
我确实有 我搞定了赛德尔
I do. I took care of Seidel.

499
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,140
他还是会支持你的
He's still gonna back you.

500
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,400
我不是说赛德尔
I'm not talking about Seidel.

501
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
我是说把吉布斯挤出委员会
I'm talking about getting Gibbs off that committee.

502
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,720
这事没那么容易
It's not that simple.

503
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,450
那有什么不容易的
What's not that simple about it?

504
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,080
我还没找到跟他有关的任何事
I haven't found anything on him yet.

505
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,610
哈维  我努力去找人帮我
Harvey, I am struggling to get someone on my side,

506
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,360
而她在委员会无时无刻不想着
and every second that she is on that committee

507
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,330
让这些人调转枪口针对我
she is turning people against me.

508
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,410
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

509
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,880
迈克  我跟你说过我来搞定
Mike, I told you I'd get it done.

510
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,180
我就一定会搞定的
I'll get it done.

511
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,810
-有什么收获  -没有
- Anything? - No.

512
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,670
和你一个小时前打电话时一样
It's the same as when you called an hour ago.

513
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,200
如果他杀了人去藏尸
If he killed someone and hid the body,

514
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,230
没有人知道会在哪
nobody knows where it is.

515
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,670
那你告诉我名单上下一个是谁
Then why don't you tell me who's next on the list.

516
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,160
哈维  我忙这个忙了一整天了
Harvey, I have been at this all day,

517
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,960
你说我们的时间所剩不多
and you said we don't have much time.

518
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,660
那你为什么不去忽悠那个家伙
Why don't you just bluff the guy

519
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,170
搞到你需要的东西
into giving you whatever you need?

520
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,720
因为这件事我们只有一次机会
Because we've only got one shot at this.

521
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,920
我掌握的信息越多
The more information I have,

522
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,930
我忽悠成功的可能性越大
the better chance a bluff is gonna work.

523
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,030
哈维  到底怎么了
Harvey, what's going on?

524
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,450
这不像你的风格宁愿待在屋里打电话
It isn't like you to stay in and make phone calls

525
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,790
也不去当面去会会别人
instead of confronting someone face-to-face.

526
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,660
要是我做不到
What if I can't do it

527
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,980
迈克不能成为律师呢
and Mike doesn't get into the Bar?

528
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,360
你怎么会这么说
How can you say that?

529
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,630
你是我见过最好的扑克玩家
You are the best poker player I have ever seen.

530
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,440
你能做到的
You can do it.

531
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,600
我觉得你不太明白  唐娜
I don't think you understand, Donna.

532
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,270
只有他不清白时忽悠才有用
A bluff only works if he's dirty.

533
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,010
要是这个家伙身家清白呢
What if the guy really is clean?

534
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,070
哈维  吉布斯把他从协会挤了出去
Harvey, Gibbs got him off the committee.

535
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,290
他并不清白
He's not clean.

536
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,560
现在  已经够了
Now, enough is enough.

537
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,420
该做什么做什么去
Go do what you do.

538
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,570
路易  你介意说下这是什么吗
Louis, you mind telling me what this is?

539
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,710
你从哪弄来的
Where'd you get that?

540
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,330
那是针对唐娜新生意的诉讼
That is a lawsuit against Donna's new business.

541
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,270
我知道那是什么
I know what it is.

542
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,940
那你为什么还不告诉她
Well, why haven't you told her about it yet?

543
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,030
因为她会认为我是因为塔拉的事心烦
Because she's gonna think that I blew it

544
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,740
而搞砸了这件事
because I was upset about Tara.

545
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,110
路易  你是不是一心扑在某个小贱人身上
Louis, did you go full-blown you on some poor bastard

546
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,940
而搞砸了唐娜成功的机会
and ruin Donna's chance at success?

547
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,720
格蕾琴 我是满怀诚意的去和解的
Gretchen, I went there in good faith to get a settlement,

548
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,980
是他们不友好
and I was ambushed.

549
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,410
-我发誓  -那你去把它处理好
- I swear. - Then you need to fix it.

550
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,060
-我不能  -为什么不能
- I can't. - Why not?

551
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,250
因为我没有办法不想塔拉
Because I cannot stop thinking about Tara.

552
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,430
我们大吵了一架
We got into a huge fight

553
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,090
我真是个  混蛋
and I was... such an asshole.

554
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,390
所以我去道歉
So I went to apologize.

555
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,920
她说她不确定她还能不能和我在一起
She said she wasn't sure she could stay with me,

556
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,720
从那以后我就没了她的消息
and I haven't heard from her since.

557
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,550
所以现在不止是生活中一个女人的事
So now instead of not knowing how to fix things

558
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,530
我解决不了
with one woman in my life,

559
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,290
而且另一个女人的事我也无法解决
I don't know how to fix things with the other.

560
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,760
路易  我之前有段很长的婚姻
Louis, I was married a long time.

561
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,700
我要告诉你  卡尔和我是有分歧的
And I'll tell you, Carl and I had some doozies.

562
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,540
老实告诉你
Tell you the truth, 

563
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,030
不是每次我都确信我们能度过的
I wasn't always sure we were gonna pull through.

564
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,320
但我们都度过了  因为我们彼此相爱
But we always did, because we loved each other.

565
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,270
如果她不再爱我了怎么办
What if she doesn't love me anymore?

566
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,900
爱不是那么容易消逝的  路易
It doesn't turn off like that, Louis.

567
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,810
而且从我的角度来看
And from where I'm standing,

568
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,740
你值得被爱
you're worth loving.

569
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,390
现在  你觉得你能解决这件事
Now, do you think you can fix this thing

570
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,690
还是说你需要我给咱们找个帮手
or do you need me to get us some help?

571
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,120
我不需要帮助
I don't need any help.

572
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,060
我要把这些家伙打的屁滚尿流
I'm gonna blow those guys out of the water.

573
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,990
-沃特・山姆森  -没错
- Walter Samson? - Yes?

574
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,510
我在外面看见你了  第一次来玩吗
I saw you out there. First time playing?

575
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,480
抱歉  我认识你吗
Sorry. Do I know you?

576
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,250
问题是  你是怎么认识安妮塔・吉布斯的
The question is, how do you know Anita Gibbs?

577
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,410
因为你把你在
Because you gave her your seat

578
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,980
律师品行委员会的位置给了她
on the Character and Fitness Committee,

579
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,650
而这个起诉迈克・罗斯的女人
and the woman who prosecuted Mike Ross

580
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,770
没有资格得到它
has no business being there.

581
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,470
-迈克・罗斯是谁  -我理解
- Who's Mike Ross? - I get it.

582
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,990
我们要这样玩  是吗
We're going that way, huh?

583
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,220
他就是吉布斯强迫你放弃
He's the reason Gibbs strong-armed you

584
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,400
你位置的原因
into giving up that seat.

585
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,440
我放弃这个位置
I gave up that seat 

586
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,830
-是因为我想花时间多陪陪家人  -瞎扯
- because I wanted to spend more time with my family. - Bullshit.

587
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,940
她发现了你不可告人的肮脏小秘密
She found out whatever dirty little secret you're hiding.

588
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,990
如果你不向我坦白
If you don't come clean with me,

589
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,430
我会去查清楚是什么  我的威胁会更甚
I'm gonna find out what it is and I'm gonna squeeze harder.

590
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,220
我不知道你是谁
I don't know who you are, 

591
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,760
但生活在一个人人都有弱点
but it must be nice living in a world

592
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,310
以及不道德行为的世界  感觉一定很好
where everyone has a weak spot and is unethical,

593
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,200
但现在的情况是
but in this case,

594
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
我选择了离职
I took a leave of absence 

595
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,860
选了一个配得上的律师替代我
and I replaced myself with a worthy attorney.

596
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,560
所以你随便去找我的弱点
So you can look for a pressure point all you want.

597
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,780
但我很遗憾的告诉你
But I'm sorry to inform you,

598
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,200
你什么也找不到的
you're not gonna find one.

599
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,400
你想知道我是谁  我是哈维・斯佩克特
You want to know who I am? My name is Harvey Specter.

600
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,170
你可以说你从没听过迈克・罗斯
And you can say you never heard of Mike Ross,

601
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,760
但我知道你听说过我
but I know you heard of me.

602
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,460
所以也许她没对你进行勒索
So maybe she didn't blackmail you.

603
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,280
也许她对你许下了什么承诺
Maybe she promised to do something for you.

604
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,510
不管是什么  我都会查清楚是什么
Either way, I'm gonna find out what it is

605
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,270
而那时你会希望你现在就告诉了我一切
and you're gonna wish you told me right now.

606
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,770
你以为你是在向我示威
You think you're showing strength.

607
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,300
但恐吓只代表软弱
But intimidation is only weakness.

608
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,000
顺便告诉你
And for your information,

609
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,910
在任命安妮塔・吉布斯
I never met Anita Gibbs

610
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,810
接替我的位置前  我从没见过她
until the day I appointed her as my replacement.

611
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,150
当我第一次见到迈克・罗斯时
When I first met Mike Ross, 

612
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,030
我以为他和我之前见过的其他罪犯一样
I thought he was like every other criminal I work with:

613
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,360
一个想不劳而获的诈骗犯
an entitled fraud who spent his life cutting corners.

614
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,300
但我来是为了告诉你们  他已经不是
But I'm here to tell you, he went into prison one man,

615
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,560
进监狱时的那个他了
and he walked out another.

616
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,240
从我的专业角度看
And in my professional opinion,

617
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,260
他拥有能作为律师服务于社会的诚信
he has the integrity to serve his community as a lawyer.

618
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,610
我不怀疑您是出于真心  罗威先生
While I don't doubt your sincerity, Mr. Rowe,

619
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,840
但仅仅因为他骗到了你
just because he was able to fool you

620
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,880
不代表他就能骗过委员会
doesn't mean he's going to be able to fool this board.

621
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,460
是罗威医生
It's Dr. Rowe.

622
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,600
我很高兴回应我陈述的人是您
And I'm glad you were the one who responded to my statement.

623
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,420
为什么
And why is that? 

624
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,130
因为之前是你试图对他的释放做出误读
Because you tried to paint a false picture of his release,

625
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,780
而我正是来拨乱反正的
and I'm here to set the record straight.

626
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,930
我没有误读
The record is straight.

627
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,320
而且你没资格讨论他之前的交易
And you're not qualified to talk about the deal that he made.

628
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,010
-不  我们想听听  -谢谢
- No, we're gonna hear this. - Thank you.

629
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,690
罗斯先生之前达成提前释放协议这不假
It's true Mr. Ross entered into an early release agreement.

630
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,830
但他为了狱友的安全延迟了自己的释放
But it's also true that he stayed in longer than he had to

631
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,280
也是事实
to keep his cellmate safe.

632
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,360
当他在里面时  他冒着生命危险
And while he was there, he risked his own life

633
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,510
阻止了一个暴力的罪犯骗得假释
to prevent a violent man from falsely obtaining parole.

634
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,590
我们都知道
And for all we know,

635
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,440
他这么做是出于私心
he did that for self-serving reasons.

636
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,460
在我看来  你现在做的事才是出于私心
And for all I know, that's what you're doing right now.

637
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,640
你过分了
You're out of line.

638
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,880
现在接受检测的人不是我
I'm not the one under examination here.

639
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,390
也不是我  我是一名监狱的心理医生
Neither am I. I'm a prison psychologist.

640
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,580
根据我的经验
And in my experience, 

641
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,650
有私心的男人不会冒着生命危险帮助他人
self-serving men do not risk their lives to help people.

642
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,620
我不觉得欺骗自己的朋友是帮助他人
I don't call defrauding your fellow man helping people.

643
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,930
更不会认为这叫诚信
And I certainly don't call it having integrity.

644
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,240
恕我直言  女士
With all due respect, ma'am,

645
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,390
我不想和你浪费口舌
I'm done wasting my breath on you

646
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,980
因为这个听证会的目的是非常明确的
because the purpose of this hearing was to determine

647
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,860
那就是迈克・罗斯是否已经改正
if Mike Ross had reformed.

648
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,550
但你似乎对那并不感兴趣
But you don't seem to be interested in that

649
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,190
因为你已经做出了判断
because you've already made your mind up.

650
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,100
也许是的
Maybe I have. 

651
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,850
那么也许是你没有资格进入委员会
Then maybe you shouldn't be on this committee.

652
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,160
如我所说  以我的专业观点
Because as I said, in my professional opinion,

653
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,150
世界需要迈克・罗斯这样的律师
the world could use a lawyer like Mike Ross.

654
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,660
如果你问我的个人意见
And if you're looking for my personal opinion,

655
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,800
你所拥有的正直
he has more integrity in his little finger

656
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,830
不及他的十分之一
than you have in your whole body.

657
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,380
哈维  你去哪了
Harvey, where have you been?

658
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,100
想办法替我们挽回局势
I've been trying to level the playing field.

659
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,520
我说的就是这个  我们已经做到了
That's the thing; we just did.

660
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,570
你真应该看看朱利叶斯在那的表现
You should have seen Julius up there.

661
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,990
如果成员们听了他的话
I mean, if those members vote no

662
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,300
居然还会投反对票...
after hearing what he had to say--

663
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,110
他说了什么都无关紧要
Doesn't matter what he had to say.

664
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,430
你还没有找到把吉布斯踢出委员会的办法
You haven't found a way to get Gibbs off that committee.

665
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,140
没有
No.

666
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,950
抱歉  迈克
I'm sorry, Mike.

667
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,690
你不用抱歉  哈维
You don't have to be sorry, Harvey.

668
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,910
她警告过我们她不会让我当成律师的
She warned us that she'd never let me into the Bar.

669
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,710
我们只是没有相信
We just didn't listen.

670
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,850
听我说
Listen to me.

671
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,300
明天早上才投票
This vote isn't until tomorrow morning.

672
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,960
我们还有时间想想办法
There's still time for us to think of something.

673
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,590
你继续想办法吧  哈维
You keep trying, Harvey.

674
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,830
我还有别的事得处理一下
I got something else I need to take care of.

675
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,340
怎么了
What's going on?

676
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,700
格蕾琴说你想和我聊聊专利的事
Gretchen said you wanted to talk to me about the patent.

677
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,000
-你们怎么来了  -我回去找他们了  唐娜
- What are you guys doing here? - I went back to them, Donna.

678
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,400
我把斯图和本杰明叫来是因为我想让你
And the reason I asked Stu and Benjamin to be here

679
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,450
知道不是我搞砸了这件事
was so that you'd know I didn't shit the bed.

680
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,510
你是说你没能让他们做出让步吗
Are you telling me you couldn't get them to back off the lawsuit?

681
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,180
他是说我们不能给真・唐娜申请专利
He's telling you we won't be able to patent The Donna at all.

682
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,190
-什么  -唐娜
- What? - Donna.

683
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,190
他们不授权让我们和他们合作
They weren't authorized to let us partner with them.

684
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,930
那正是我让你处理的事
That's what I sent you over there to take care of.

685
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,700
我知道  他们说他们会和我们
I know, and then they said they would fight us

686
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,980
把官司打到底的
to the ends of the earth.

687
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,690
所以我想尽办法
So I pulled out every trick in the book.

688
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,770
让他们提了条件
And I got them to make you an offer.

689
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,820
听起来像是买断
An offer sounds like a buyout.

690
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,140
因为就是买断
That's because it is a buyout.

691
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,870
用一项特别条款  允许我们
With a special provision that allows us

692
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,510
生产真・唐娜做内部使用
to produce The Donna for in-house use.

693
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,320
那不够好
That's not good enough.

694
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,650
唐娜  他们愿意付一大笔钱
Donna, we're talking about a lot of money.

695
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,300
我并不在乎钱  斯图
I don't care about the money, Stu.

696
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,170
我在乎的是路易没有为我而战
I care that Louis didn't fight for me.

697
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,080
我为你斗争了  唐娜  我发誓
I did fight for you, Donna, I swear.

698
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,090
他们吃定我们了  我没有什么能做的了
They got us dead to rights. There's nothing more I can do.

699
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,380
扯淡  路易・利特从不向任何人妥协
Bullshit. Louis Litt does not roll over for anybody.

700
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,650
他没有妥协  唐娜
He didn't roll over, Donna.

701
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,610
我和本杰明仔细查看了一下
I went over it with Benjamin,

702
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,800
我们没办法把重叠部分降到百分之30以下
and we can't get the overlap under 30%.

703
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,240
我还让我自己的律师看了
I also ran it by my own attorney 

704
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,320
他对路易给我们拿到的条件感到很震惊
and he was shocked at what Louis was able to get us.

705
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,740
所以你是说你想要接受吗
So you're telling me you want to take it?

706
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,070
我们想接受
We do.

707
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,230
但是没有你的话就没有真・唐娜
But The Donna wouldn't even exist without you,

708
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,040
我们是搭档  所以如果你不想接受的话
and we're partners, so if you don't want to,

709
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,920
我们就不接受
then we won't.

710
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,520
我得想想
I'm gonna need to think about it.

711
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,330
-那是什么  -自由铁路公司
- What's that? - Liberty Rail.

712
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,210
以前我就想给过你
I tried to give it to you once before.

713
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,390
但你不收
You wouldn't take it.

714
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,970
你说只有在没有附带条件的情况下你才会收下
You said it should come without strings.

715
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,950
现在我给你  没有附带条件
Well, here it is. No strings.

716
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,020
还是有条件的  你知道的
It's still got strings, and you know it.

717
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,960
你想让我帮迈克当上律师
You want me to let Mike in the Bar.

718
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,070
我的确想  但无论你帮不帮我都会给你这个
I do, but I'm giving you this whether you do that or not.

719
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,810
为什么
Why would you do that?

720
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,210
因为我希望如果我向你证明我可以改变
Because I'm hoping if I showed you I could change,

721
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,060
也许你能相信他也能改变
maybe you'd believe he could too.

722
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,860
你换他
You for him.

723
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,170
什么
What?

724
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,280
明天早上  我会问迈克
Tomorrow morning, I'm going to ask Mike

725
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,870
他在皮尔逊-斯佩克特工作时
if anyone knew he was a fraud 

726
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,990
有没有人知道他是个骗子
while he was at Pearson Specter.

727
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,230
他要承认你知道  我就让他当律师
He admits you knew, I'll let him in the Bar.

728
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,860
如果我那么做  他们会把我踢出律师协会
I do that, they'll kick me out.

729
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,710
那就是"你换他"的含义
That's what "You for him" means.

730
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,300
你说过这次你会为他这么做的
You said you'd do it for him once.

731
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,700
现在就是付诸行动的时候
This is your chance to put your money where your mouth is.

732
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,820
他不会答应
He won't go for it.

733
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,910
他想当律师都快想疯了
He wants to be a lawyer so bad he can taste it.

734
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,780
你可以强迫他的
You can make him go for it.

735
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,630
记住
Just remember,

736
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,880
你不喜欢上次迟了的感觉
you didn't like being too late last time.

737
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,780
这次就不要再迟了
You're not too late this time.

738
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,480
太好了  你们俩都在  谢谢你们留下
Good. You're both here. Thanks for staying.

739
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,890
我们当然会留下  你信息上说很紧急
Of course we stayed. Your message said it was urgent.

740
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,520
怎么了
What's going on?

741
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,690
和解有什么问题吗
Is there a problem with the settlement?

742
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,090
并不是  我向奥利佛保证我会告诉你实情
No. I gave Oliver my word that I'd tell you the truth,

743
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,780
所以  我来告诉你实情了
so... I'm here to tell you the truth.

744
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,310
-什么实情  -我做了个交易
- Truth about what? - I made a deal.

745
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,590
等价交换  我们解决矿工的案子
A quid pro quo that we would handle the miners' case

746
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,820
以换取进入律师协会的机会
in exchange for the chance to be admitted to the Bar.

747
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,370
你在逗我吗
Are you goddamn kidding me?

748
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,450
我直截了当的问你有没有事瞒我
I asked you point blank if something was going on,

749
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,570
-你却在我面前撒谎  -纳森  我很抱歉
- and you lied to my face? - Nathan, I'm sorry.

750
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,530
但我只是想等
But I didn't want to tell you

751
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,040
事情真的能办再告诉你
until there was something to tell.

752
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,680
你是想等你自己全身而退之后再告诉我
You weren't going to tell me until you got away with it.

753
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,450
不  我不是
No, I wasn't.

754
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,130
事实证明  我无法全身而退了
But as it turns out, I'm not gonna get away with it,

755
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,700
但我还是要告诉你
and I'm telling you anyway.

756
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,850
-你被解雇了  -纳森  拜托...
- You're fired. - Nathan, please--

757
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,580
我一点也不在乎你接下来要说什么
I don't give a shit what's about to come out of your mouth.

758
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,550
清干净你的办公室
Clean out your office.

759
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,290
永远别再出现在这里
Never show your face around here again.

760
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,180
等等  别这么做
Wait. Don't do it.

761
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,520
你听到他说的话了吗
Did you hear what he said?

762
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,980
他说了谎  一而再再而三地说谎...
He lied. Not once, not twice--

763
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,220
我不在乎  因为我们需要他
I don't care, because we need him.

764
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,270
-我们不需要他  -索菲亚需要他
- We don't need him-- - Sophia needed him,

765
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,460
却只能由我代理  看看结果吧
and she got me, and look what happened.

766
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,300
是  纳森  他是做了坏事
Yeah, Nathan, that was some shady shit he pulled,

767
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,790
但如果你看不到他确实在乎委托人
but you gotta be blind if you can't see

768
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,360
那你一定是瞎了
that he actually cares.

769
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,120
而且在他来之前  我们从未获得过
And I don't remember us beating down a place

770
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,220
像极速数据处理公司案这样的胜利
like Velocity Data before he got here.

771
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,320
所以如果你无所谓的话  我想让他留下来
So if it's all the same to you, I'd like him to stay.

772
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,070
但我对这事不仅不无所谓  奥利弗
Well, it's not all the same to me, Oliver.

773
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,270
而且还有决定权
It's up to me.

774
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,040
像迈克一样对我有所隐瞒的人没有决定权
Not to the person that kept it from me as much as Mike did.

775
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,050
他没有想瞒你  纳森
He didn't keep it from you, Nathan.

776
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,100
他说如果我不告诉你  他就会告诉你
He said that if I didn't tell you, he would.

777
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,640
所以我来了
So here I am.

778
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,410
我知道我的理由站不住脚  但是
And I know I don't have a leg to stand on, but...

779
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,770
我想留下来
I'd like to stay.

780
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,450
周一早晨  你最好
Monday morning, you better start

781
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,720
拿出实际行动
putting your money where your mouth is

782
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,850
再为我们接个能赚五万美元的案子
and find us another $50,000 case.

783
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,060
-路易  你有空吗  -当然  哈维
- Louis, do you have a minute? - Sure, Harvey.

784
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,550
我不知道你对迈克
I don't know how much you know

785
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,450
听证会的情况了解多少
about what's going on with Mike's hearing.

786
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,700
我能看出你的表情意味着
Enough to know that look on your face

787
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,330
-听证会情况不太好  -是不太好
-means it's not going well. - It's not.

788
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,620
我可能有办法挽回局面
And I may have a way to change it,

789
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,520
但我想先和我的合伙人谈谈
but I wanted to run it by my partner first,

790
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,510
因为这可能意味着我要休息一段时间
because it may mean that I need a little time off.

791
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,000
"休息一段时间"是什么意思
What do you mean, "A little time off"?

792
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,670
意思是吉布斯跟我谈了个条件
I mean Gibbs offered me a deal.

793
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,020
迈克公开承认我知道他是个骗子
Mike goes on record admitting I knew he was a fraud,

794
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,570
她就投票让他进入律师协会
she'll vote to let him in the Bar.

795
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,520
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

796
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,640
如果你这么做  就不只是休息一段时间了
You do that, it won't be a little time off.

797
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,930
你会被取消律师资格的
You'll get disbarred.

798
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,460
但那时候  迈克就是律师了
And by then, he'll be a lawyer.

799
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,330
我们可以主张他这么说只是为了安抚吉布斯
And we can argue that he said that just to appease Gibbs.

800
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,580
胡说  如果你这样做
Bullshit. You do this, 

801
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,270
我们律所就会损失两个冠名合伙人
two out of three names on that wall will be gone, 

802
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,830
我一个人无法维持律所运转
and I won't be able to keep this firm going.

803
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,900
如果你不行的话  我们也是帮了迈克的忙 
And if you can't, we'll have done it for Mike.

804
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
赞恩会聘用你的
Zane will hire you.

805
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,710
我不想去赞恩的律所
I don't want to go to Zane's.

806
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,250
我想按照我们曾说过的那样
I want to do what we said we were gonna do

807
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,520
-一起重建这家律所  -路易  我欠他的
- and rebuild this place together. - Louis, I owe him.

808
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,530
那你欠我的呢
Well, what about what you owe me?

809
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,370
-你说过我们是合伙人  -我们是啊
- You said we were partners. - We are partners.

810
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,950
所以我才跟你说这些
Which is why I came to you with this.

811
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,970
不  你不是来征求我的同意的
No, you didn't come to ask my permission.

812
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,890
你是来通知我你要这么做的
You came to tell me that you were gonna do this.

813
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,540
如果就是如此呢
And what if I did?

814
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,660
那你就不只是个混蛋了
Then you're not just an asshole.

815
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,910
你还是个白痴  因为迈克・罗斯绝不可能
You're an idiot, because there's no way

816
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,000
同意用你的利益去交换他的
Mike Ross ever agrees to trading you for him.

817
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,880
-我会强迫他  -不  你强迫不了我
- Well, I'll make him agree. - No, you won't.

818
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,230
迈克
Mike.

819
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,640
哈维  不管她给你提供了什么条件
Harvey, whatever deal she's offering you,

820
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,530
我都不会接受的
I'm not gonna take it.

821
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,570
你都不知道条件是什么呢
You don't even know what it is.

822
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,770
我不管条件是什么
I don't care what it is.

823
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,110
如果要以把你从律师协会除名为代价
I'm not getting into the Bar

824
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,080
我是不会进入律师协会的
if it means getting you kicked out.

825
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,810
迈克  她想整的是我  一直如此
Mike, she wants me. She always has.

826
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,720
不  哈维  她想整我们俩
No, Harvey. She wants both of us.

827
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,170
除非把我们俩都整垮  否则她不会罢休的
And she's not going to stop until she gets both of us.

828
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,790
-你也不能确定  -不  我能
- You don't know that. - Yes, I do.

829
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,680
而且如果你不明白这一点
And if you don't get that,

830
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,000
那说明你是正中她下怀
then she's got you right where she wants you.

831
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,810
所以你明天就坐以待毙
So you're just gonna sit there tomorrow

832
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,410
让她夺走属于你的一切吗
and let her take everything away from you?

833
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,010
她没有夺走我的什么
She's not taking anything away.

834
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,100
她只是让事情保持了原样
She's keeping things exactly the way they are.

835
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,500
你是说在法律诊所工作
You mean working for that clinic.

836
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,870
哈维  我还能在法律诊所工作就很幸运了
Harvey, I'm lucky to still have a job at that clinic.

837
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,540
所以明天早晨  我会昂首挺胸地
So tomorrow morning, I'm gonna go in there

838
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,280
走进听证会
with my head held high.

839
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,960
但我不会
But what I'm not gonna do

840
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,720
让她夺走属于你的一切的
is let her strip you of everything that you are.

841
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,680
哈维  他说得对
Harvey, he's right.

842
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,110
放手吧
Let it go.

843
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,630
不管是什么事  唐娜...
Whatever it is, Donna...

844
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,450
哈维  我知道你现在处境困难
Harvey, I know you're in a rough place right now,

845
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,950
但是该来的迟早会来的
but whatever's gonna happen with Mike is gonna happen.

846
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,630
你已经尽力了
You've done everything you can.

847
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
而且我也实在等不下去了
And I'm tired of putting my wants on hold.

848
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,050
你想要什么
What is it?

849
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,890
你知道本杰明为我做的那个产品
You know about my product with Benjamin.

850
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,220
我知道
I do.

851
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,380
我们的软件和另一个公司的产品
Well, it turns out we have a 32.5% overlap

852
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,520
存在32.5%的重合部分
on our software with another company's.

853
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,000
他们拒绝让步  路易说
They refused to budge, and Louis said

854
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,630
他使劲了浑身解数让我们走到这一步
he pulled out every trick in the book to get us this.

855
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,030
-你们能让重合低于30%吗  -不行
- Can you get it under 30%? - No.

856
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,270
那就把钱收下吧
Then take the money.

857
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,530
我想要的不是钱
I don't want the money.

858
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,630
-唐娜  -我想要更多
- Donna-- - I want something more.

859
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,460
我从未出口承认过
And I've never said that out loud,

860
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,600
但我无法再假装这不是真的了
but I can't pretend that's not true anymore.

861
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,390
你说"更多"是什么意思
What do you mean "More"?

862
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,140
我不知道
I don't know.

863
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,690
我想我得把这一点弄清楚才行
I guess I'm gonna have to figure that out.

864
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,140
晚安  哈维
Good night, Harvey.

865
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,020
明天听证会见
I'll see you tomorrow at the hearing.

866
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:26,870
罗斯先生
Mr. Ross,

867
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,830
我们准备好听取你的最终陈述了
we are prepared to hear your final statement.

868
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,400
在这之前  我还有最后一个问题
Before we do, I have one last question.

869
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,930
罗斯先生  你说你已改过自新
Mr. Ross, you say you're a changed man

870
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,590
还说自己重视事实
and you care about the truth.

871
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,770
但我想看看你是否能够说出事实
But I want to know if you're capable of telling the truth.

872
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,950
所以我要问你一个问题
So I'm going to ask you a question and I suggest

873
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,580
我建议你小心斟酌自己的答案
that you consider your answer very carefully,

874
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,020
因为在我看来
because as far as I'm concerned,

875
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,280
你的回答决定着
your answer will determine

876
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,340
你是否能够成为一名律师
whether or not you become a lawyer.

877
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,620
你在皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所
During your time at Pearson Specter Litt,

878
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,120
工作时  当时那里有人知道
did anyone there have knowledge of the fact

879
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,980
你是冒牌律师这个事实吗
that you were a fraud?

880
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,000
罗斯先生  律所里其他人知道吗
Mr. Ross. Did anyone else know?

881
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,750
我知道
I knew.

882
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,920
如果你非要拉一个人下马
And if you're looking for a scalp,

883
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,400
那就我来
you can have mine.

884
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,060
在我印象中  本次听证会无关于
But I was under the impression that this hearing

885
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,360
我过去那间律师  但无论怎样
was not about my old firm, but whether or not

886
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,340
罗斯先生都理应成为一名律师
Mr. Ross should be a lawyer.

887
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,460
依我看这是他应得的
I say he should.

888
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,870
你说什么并不重要
It doesn't matter what you say.

889
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,910
他已经找到人为他作证
He's already had someone testify for him.

890
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,360
我来这里不是为了谈论他
I'm not here to talk about him.

891
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,380
我来这里是为了谈论另一个人
I'm here to talk about someone else.

892
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,530
其他人和今天的听证会无关
Someone else has nothing to do with this--

893
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,210
我想听她说说
I'd like to hear this.

894
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,960
15年前  一个年轻女人
15 years ago, a young woman was arrested

895
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,610
因非法获取处方药而遭到逮捕
for illegally obtaining prescription drugs.

896
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,210
原来她患有慢性疼痛
Turns out she had chronic pain

897
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,140
但她不想从医学院退学
and didn't want to drop out of med school,

898
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,020
否则可能再也回不去了
possibly never to return.

899
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,060
因此她从自己实习的医院
So she stole a couple of prescription pads

900
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,090
偷了一些处方药
from the hospital where she was interning--

901
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,320
这一罪行可以被判处七年监禁
a crime with a mandatory sentence of seven years.

902
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,270
但当时检察官并未对她严惩
But instead of throwing the book at her,

903
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,640
而是选择了法外开恩
the prosecuting attorney showed mercy,

904
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,820
把控告判定为品行不端
had the charges knocked down to a misdemeanor,

905
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,760
建议缓刑  把记录封存
recommended probation, and sealed the records.

906
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,010
这是个感人的故事  但我不明白
That's a touching story, but I don't see

907
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,710
随便某律师和本次的品行考核有什么关系
what a random attorney has to do with these proceedings.

908
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,620
她说的不是随便某律师
She's not talking about a random attorney.

909
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,560
她说的是我
She's talking about me.

910
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,690
但仅仅因为我曾展现恻隐之心
But just because I showed compassion once

911
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,860
并不意味着现在他也值得我这么做
doesn't mean he deserves it now.

912
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,080
也许他是不值得
Maybe he doesn't.

913
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,630
但现在那个年轻女人成了一位急诊室医生
But that young woman is now an ER doctor.

914
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,310
她能救人性命
She saves lives.

915
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,930
因为你拯救了她的世界
And the world's a better place

916
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,670
她也让世界变得更好
because you saved hers.

917
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,690
谢谢你  皮尔逊女士  罗斯先生
Thank you, Ms. Pearson. Mr. Ross?

918
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,950
我认为我没有什么可多说的了
I don't think I can add anything to that.

919
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,950
我已阐明了所有理由
I've made my case.

920
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,380
决定权在你们手中
I leave the choice to you.

921
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,580
本次听证会结束
Then this hearing has concluded.

922
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,960
我们审议后会在今天之内给予你答复
We will deliberate and let you know our decision by day's end.

923
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,360
谢谢
Thank you.

924
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,660
我们现在要做些什么
So what do we do now?

925
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,430
他们说了会在今天之内给出答复
They said they would let us know by the end of the day.

926
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,470
那我们就等着吧
So we wait.

927
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,910
今天已经结束了  也就意味着...
Well, it is the end of the day, which means...

928
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,110
这并不意味着任何事  路易
It doesn't mean anything, Louis.

929
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,440
不管那边进行得怎么样
Whatever's going on in there,

930
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,220
赛德尔都会竭力争取的
Seidel's gonna fight like hell.

931
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,620
这也改变不了什么
It's not gonna make a difference.

932
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,600
安妮塔・吉布斯绝不会改变她的心意
She's never gonna change her mind.

933
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,970
-我认为她会的  -这是什么意思
- I think she will. - What do you mean?

934
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:31,650
我意思是那个故事并不只是个好故事
I mean that story wasn't any old story,

935
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,530
故事里的主角也不是一个女人
and that woman wasn't really a woman.

936
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,740
而是一个叫约瑟夫・奥尼尔的男人
It was a man named Joseph O'Neal.

937
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,800
他是沃特・山姆森的教子
And it was Walter Samson's godson.

938
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,660
-所以她确实找了关系  -是的
- So she did call in a favor. - Yeah, she did.

939
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,730
那我们得把她从委员会剔除
Then we need to get her kicked off that board.

940
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,360
不  哈维  我们不需要
No, Harvey. We don't.

941
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,660
因为我大老远飞过来
Because I didn't fly all the way down here

942
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,180
不是为了强迫她
to strong-arm that woman.

943
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,230
而且我知道太阳和风的故事
And I know the story of the wind and the sun.

944
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,300
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

945
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,180
她在说一则伊索寓言
She's talking about Aesop's fable.

946
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,660
故事是如果你想让人
Which basically says that if you want to get a man

947
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,630
你已经尽力了
You've done everything you can.

948
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
而且我也实在等不下去了
And I'm tired of putting my wants on hold.

949
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,050
你想要什么
What is it?

950
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,890
你知道本杰明为我做的那个产品
You know about my product with Benjamin.

951
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,220
我知道
I do.

952
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,380
我们的软件和另一个公司的产品
Well, it turns out we have a 32.5% overlap

953
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,520
存在32.5%的重合部分
on our software with another company's.

954
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,000
他们拒绝让步  路易说
They refused to budge, and Louis said

955
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,630
他使劲了浑身解数让我们走到这一步
he pulled out every trick in the book to get us this.

956
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,030
-你们能让重合低于30%吗  -不行
- Can you get it under 30%? - No.

957
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,270
那就把钱收下吧
Then take the money.

958
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,530
我想要的不是钱
I don't want the money.

959
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,630
-唐娜  -我想要更多
- Donna-- - I want something more.

960
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,460
我从未出口承认过
And I've never said that out loud,

961
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,600
但我无法再假装这不是真的了
but I can't pretend that's not true anymore.

962
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,390
你说"更多"是什么意思
What do you mean "More"?

963
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,140
我不知道
I don't know.

964
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,690
我想我得把这一点弄清楚才行
I guess I'm gonna have to figure that out.

965
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,140
晚安  哈维
Good night, Harvey.

966
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,020
明天听证会见
I'll see you tomorrow at the hearing.

967
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:26,870
罗斯先生
Mr. Ross,

968
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,830
我们准备好听取你的最终陈述了
we are prepared to hear your final statement.

969
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,400
在这之前  我还有最后一个问题
Before we do, I have one last question.

970
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,930
罗斯先生  你说你已改过自新
Mr. Ross, you say you're a changed man

971
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,590
还说自己重视事实
and you care about the truth.

972
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,770
但我想看看你是否能够说出事实
But I want to know if you're capable of telling the truth.

973
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,950
所以我要问你一个问题
So I'm going to ask you a question and I suggest

974
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,580
我建议你小心斟酌自己的答案
that you consider your answer very carefully,

975
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,020
因为在我看来
because as far as I'm concerned,

976
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,280
你的回答决定着
your answer will determine

977
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,340
你是否能够成为一名律师
whether or not you become a lawyer.

978
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,620
你在皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所
During your time at Pearson Specter Litt,

979
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,120
工作时  当时那里有人知道
did anyone there have knowledge of the fact

980
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,980
你是冒牌律师这个事实吗
that you were a fraud?

981
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,000
罗斯先生  律所里其他人知道吗
Mr. Ross. Did anyone else know?

982
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,750
我知道
I knew.

983
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,920
如果你非要拉一个人下马
And if you're looking for a scalp,

984
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,400
那就我来
you can have mine.

那我们就等着吧
So we wait.

1028
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,910
今天已经结束了  也就意味着...
Well, it is the end of the day, which means...

1029
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,110
这并不意味着任何事  路易
It doesn't mean anything, Louis.

1030
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,440
不管那边进行得怎么样
Whatever's going on in there,

1031
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,220
赛德尔都会竭力争取的
Seidel's gonna fight like hell.

1032
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,620
这也改变不了什么
It's not gonna make a difference.

1033
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,600
安妮塔・吉布斯绝不会改变她的心意
She's never gonna change her mind.

1034
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,970
-我认为她会的  -这是什么意思
- I think she will. - What do you mean?

1035
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:31,650
我意思是那个故事并不只是个好故事
I mean that story wasn't any old story,

1036
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,530
故事里的主角也不是一个女人
and that woman wasn't really a woman.

1037
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,740
而是一个叫约瑟夫・奥尼尔的男人
It was a man named Joseph O'Neal.

1038
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,800
他是沃特・山姆森的教子
And it was Walter Samson's godson.

1039
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,660
-所以她确实找了关系  -是的
- So she did call in a favor. - Yeah, she did.

1040
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,730
那我们得把她从委员会剔除
Then we need to get her kicked off that board.

1041
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,360
不  哈维  我们不需要
No, Harvey. We don't.

1042
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,660
因为我大老远飞过来
Because I didn't fly all the way down here

1043
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,180
不是为了强迫她
to strong-arm that woman.

1044
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,230
而且我知道太阳和风的故事
And I know the story of the wind and the sun.

1045
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,300
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

1046
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,180
她在说一则伊索寓言
She's talking about Aesop's fable.

1047
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,660
故事是如果你想让人
Which basically says that if you want to get a man

1048
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,230
脱掉衣服  吹冷风是没用的
to take off his coat, you don't blow it off.

1049
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,130
必须给他温暖  才能让他自己脱掉
You make him feel warm, and he'll take it off on his own.

1050
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,840
这不是解决办法  这是祈祷
That's not a strategy; it's a prayer.

1051
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,390
路易  我已经承认了我知道迈克的事
Louis, I already admitted that I knew about Mike,

1052
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,290
也唤起了她的同情心
and I reminded her of her own compassion.

1053
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,990
这是最好的办法了
That's the best we're going to do.

1054
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,420
你知道他们可能会吊销你律师执照的
You know they could disbar you for that.

1055
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,900
在纽约  他们可能会
In New York, they might.

1056
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,790
但在芝加哥  没人会关心的
In Chicago, nobody's gonna care.

1057
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,010
谢谢你  杰西卡
Thank you, Jessica.

1058
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,950
别谢我  谢哈维
Don't thank me. Thank Harvey.

1059
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,490
是他叫我回来的
He's the one that called me.

1060
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,320
是赛德尔打来的
It's Seidel.

1061
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,840
你好
Hello.

1062
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,510
我会转告他的
I'll tell him.

1063
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,680
感谢来电
Thanks for calling.

1064
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,790
你进了
You're in.

1065
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,900
我的天呐  梦想成真了
Oh, my God. It happened.

1066
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,880
我去开瓶香槟庆祝
I'm gonna go get us some champagne.

1067
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,830
太感谢你了
Thank you so much.

1068
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,970
谢谢你赶来
Thank you for flying in.

1069
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,990
我怎么会错过
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

1070
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,020
半小时前你说要去洗手间
You said you had to go to the bathroom a half hour ago,

1071
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,840
但却一直没回来喝香槟
but you never came back for your champagne.

1072
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,430
我知道
I know.

1073
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,240
路易  出什么事了
Louis, what's wrong?

1074
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,450
你都没问过我塔拉那边怎么样了
You never asked me how it went with Tara,

1075
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,740
毕竟我把迈克的事告诉她了
telling her about Mike.

1076
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,970
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

1077
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,100
我最近一心扑在听证会的事上
I just got caught up with the hearing.

1078
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,080
就是  我...
The thing is, I...

1079
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,000
我告诉她了
I told her.

1080
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,060
我们大吵一架
We got into a huge fight.

1081
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,670
她说她要考虑一下
And she said she needed to think about

1082
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,240
看能不能原谅我
whether or not she could forgive me.

1083
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,550
-然后呢  -她刚打给我了
- And? - She just called

1084
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,560
就在哈维跟我们说迈克的事的时候
when Harvey was giving us the news about Mike.

1085
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,360
给我留了个十五秒的留言  但我不敢听
Left a 15-second voicemail. I'm afraid to listen to it.

1086
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,520
路易
Louis...

1087
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,830
要不就是要跟我说她再也不想见到我了
She's either gonna tell me that she never wants

1088
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,890
要么就是要和好
to see me again or she wants to make up.

1089
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,120
你想让我替你听吗
Do you want me to listen for you?

1090
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,650
不想  但我想我听的时候你陪着我
No. But I'd like it if you stay with me while I do.

1091
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,580
没问题
Of course.

1092
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,310
这是什么
What's that?

1093
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,680
我想给你一份礼物
I wanted to give you a present.

1094
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,320
提前把你第一年的工资给你
Your first year's salary in advance.

1095
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,400
-欢迎回来  -哈维  我已经不知道
- Welcome back. - Harvey, I'm running out of ways 

1096
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,060
该怎么告诉你我不想做企业律师了
to tell you I don't want to be a corporate lawyer.

1097
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,230
在你给我答复之前
Before you answer,

1098
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,710
先看看这张支票吧
you might want to take a look at this check.

1099
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,110
-你这是贿赂  -我只是想套牢你
- You're trying to bribe me. - I'm trying to close you.

1100
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,890
-我跟你说了...  -我知道
- I told you-- - Yeah, I get it.

1101
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,700
你想做好事
You want to do good.

1102
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,480
你要是真想做好事
Well, you really want to do good?

1103
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,380
把这笔钱捐的一半去诊所
Donate half of this to the clinic.

1104
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,600
够他们用一年了
You'll fund the place for a year.

1105
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,870
你以为我是想做这种好事
Oh, so that's what you think I'm all about.

1106
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,530
-就光捐钱  -不是
- Just giving money. - No.

1107
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,780
但我觉得你该做的好事绝不止在那里工作
But I think you're about more than just working at that place.

1108
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,950
-你自己也知道  -你在说什么
- And you know it. - What are you talking about?

1109
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,790
我提出了个交易  为你  也为我
I'm offering you a deal. One for you, one for me.

1110
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,820
你可以拯救花斑猫头鹰  阻止全球变暖
You can save the spotted owls, stop global warming,

1111
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,640
受苦的女性想解救多少就解救多少
and help as many damsels in distress as you like.

1112
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,330
好消息是  这些好事  你从这里做起
And the good news is, you'll be doing it from here.

1113
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,030
你为什么觉得我会答应
What makes you think I'd take you up on that?

1114
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,400
因为  迈克
Because here's the thing, Mike.

1115
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,650
你想要在这里的  你自己也清楚
You wanna be here, and you know it.

1116
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,830
不是的...
That's not true-- 

1117
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,720
我看见了你脸上是怎样的神情
I saw the look on your face when you strong-armed Palmer

1118
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,060
当你完胜帕默时  挑战赛德尔时
and you took on Seidel and every other talented attorney

1119
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,920
打败每一个才华横溢的律师时
you've beaten over the years.

1120
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,120
我之前就告诉过你
And I told you this once before.

1121
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,340
这里是职业玩家的地盘
This is the major leagues.

1122
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,010
这种成就感你在别的地方是找不到的
You don't get this feeling anywhere else.

1123
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,460
现在你想要的我都能给你
And I'm offering you the best of both.

1124
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,430
你为什么要给我比和平手势
Why are you giving me a peace sign?

1125
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,080
-要双倍  -啥
- Double it. - What?

1126
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,540
赞助诊所一年  不够
I don't wanna just fund the clinic for a year.

1127
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,230
我要两年的赞助
I wanna fund it for two.

1128
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,190
除了这个  还得有剩的钱
And while we're at it, I want some left over

1129
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,280
给我和我未来的老婆买点好的
for a little something nice for me and the wife-to-be.

1130
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,930
-就这样就够了吗  -差得远呢
- That's all it's gonna take? - Oh, not even close.

1131
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,350
我也没想过要砍价
I wouldn't have it any other way.

1132
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,790
我想给诊所什么案子
Any case I want to bring the clinic on to,

1133
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,160
-就给什么案子  -成交
- I can. - Done.

1134
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,610
我想从诊所带什么人  就带什么人
Anyone I want to bring over from the clinic, I can.

1135
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,080
路易说了不算  你说也不算
Louis doesn't get a say, you don't get a say,

1136
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,090
-取消只要哈佛生的规定  -成交
- no Harvard rule. - Done.

1137
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,550
还有一件事  但你不会喜欢的
And there's one more thing, and you're not gonna like it.

1138
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,130
你别想要我的办公室
You are not getting my office.

1139
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,020
我不仅要  还要告诉你为什么该给我
Oh, yes, I am. And I will tell you why.

1140
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,500
-为什么  -因为她走了  哈维
- Why? - 'Cause she's gone, Harvey.

1141
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,360
而且她不会再回来了
And she's not coming back.

1142
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,540
是时候由你掌权了
It's time for you to take the reins.
