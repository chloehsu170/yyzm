{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on "Suits"...

15
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,630
瑞秋  我是邓巴教授
Rachel, it's Professor Dunbar.

16
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,900
我在想你是否对
I was wondering if you'd be interested in helping me

17
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,410
无罪计划感兴趣
with the Innocence Project.

18
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,610
你想让我帮你让无辜的人摆脱死刑
You want me to help you get an innocent man off death row?

19
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,360
什么事  哈维
What do you want, Harvey?

20
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,730
帮我保护迈克・罗斯
Help me protect Mike Ross.

21
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,080
他和我抓的一个人被关在一起
He's in there with a guy I put away,

22
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,270
那人可不是吃素的
and the guy is no joke.

23
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,350
但你要我做什么
What am I supposed to do?

24
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,490
我要你把那个人转到别的监狱
You're supposed to move the guy to another prison.

25
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,120
你想跟我一对一  来吧
You want me one-on-one? You got it.

26
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,270
我打算用这个  而他们会按住你
I'm gonna use this, and they're gonna hold you.

27
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,720
-不不不  -怎么回事
- No! - What's going on here?

28
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,520
你为什么带警卫一起回来
Why'd you come back with a guard?

29
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,030
我那么做不是为了让你原谅我
I didn't do it to get you to forgive me.

30
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,140
我当初就不该让他进来
I never should have let him in here in the first place.

31
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,990
你在等待审判期间在监狱服刑的时间
The time you served while awaiting trial

32
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,720
没有被算入刑期
was never factored into your sentence.

33
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,590
再过六周你就能被保释了
You're eligible for parole in six weeks.

34
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,900
你以为我不知道这是你的保护人
You think I don't know this is your protector's idea

35
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,130
用来保护你的把戏吗
to get me off your back?

36
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,130
不  弗兰克
Nah, Frank.

37
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,920
哈维想的办法是让我告诉这些人你做了线人
Harvey's idea was for me to tell these guys that you're an informant.

38
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,800
我找到了让迈克提前出狱的办法
I figured out a way to get Mike out early.

39
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,560
代价是什么
What's the catch?

40
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,990
他得告发他的室友
He has to inform on his roommate.

41
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,620
迈克让他开口就自由了
Mike gets him to turn, he's free.

42
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,920
你们什么时候要迈克的答案
When do you need an answer by?

43
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,020
昨天
Yesterday.

44
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,620
而且答案必须是接受
And the answer needs to be yes.

45
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,440
哈维  等等
Harvey, wait a second.

46
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,210
你要去哪
Where are you going?

47
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,590
你觉得我要去哪
Where do you think I'm going?

48
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,600
我要去见迈克
I'm gonna see Mike.

49
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,670
我知道你要说什么
And I know what you're going to say,

50
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,080
但迈克是为了保护我们进监狱
but Mike went to prison so we wouldn't have to,

51
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,380
现在他因为一个我送进去的人身陷危险
and now he's in danger from a guy I put away.

52
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,830
所以请理解我不能
So you'll forgive me if I don't stand around and wait

53
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,070
干等着你来拍板
for you to drop the hammer.

54
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,540
你以为我愿意让他在里面呆着吗
You think I like the idea of him rotting in that place?

55
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,250
但如果你想办好这事
But if you want this thing to work,

56
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,890
就不能大半夜的跑过去
you can't go running up there in the middle of the night.

57
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,240
你听到卡荷尔的话了  他要尽快答复
You heard Cahill. He needs an answer yesterday.

58
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,150
他需要的是结果
What he needs is results.

59
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,170
如果迈克的律师在大半夜的
And if Mike's lawyer pulls him out of his cell

60
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,960
把他从牢房里叫出来
in the middle of the night, then his roommate

61
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,230
那这事还没开始张罗
is going to sense there's something wrong

62
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,070
他室友就能察觉出有问题
before this thing even gets started.

63
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,640
好吧  但我明早第一时间就要赶过去
Fine, but I'm going up there first thing in the morning,

64
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,180
你说什么都阻止不了我
and nothing you say is going to stop me.

65
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,840
睡不着吗
Can't sleep?

66
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,460
也不算是
Not really.

67
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,160
好吧  反正你也醒着
Well, as long as you're up,

68
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,680
不如考虑一下放点自己的照片吧
might want to think about putting up some pictures of your own

69
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,690
这样你就不用总盯着我的看了
that way yon won't have to keep staring at mine.

70
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,270
他们多大
How old are they?

71
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,420
麦蒂七岁了
Maddy is seven.

72
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,700
纳特刚刚五岁
Nate just turned five.

73
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,930
他们看起来很可爱
They look really sweet.

74
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,760
是啊  他们很棒
Yeah...they're great.

75
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,770
你多久能见一次他们
How often do you get to see 'em?

76
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,700
-不见  -什么叫不见
- I don't. - What do you mean you don't?

77
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,540
离婚闹僵了还是什么别的事
Bad divorce or something?

78
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,330
不  不是那样
Nah, nah, nothing like that.

79
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,420
我们结婚十年了
We've been married for ten years.

80
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,970
我只是不让他们来这里
I just--I just don't let 'em come here.

81
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,080
什么  为什么
What? Why not?

82
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,880
他们不应该看到自己的父亲是个罪犯
They shouldn't see their father as a criminal.

83
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,980
凯文  别这样伙计
Kevin, come on, man.

84
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,160
我知道这对他们来讲很难
I know it's hard on them.

85
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,110
在这里的每一天我都很痛苦
It tears me up every single day that I'm here.

86
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,960
但他们是孩子  他们很顽强
But they're kids. They're resilient.

87
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,930
是吗  我不太确定
Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure.

88
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,450
迈克  你没有孩子
Well, Mike, you don't have kids.

89
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,750
你理解不了
So you don't know.

90
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,900
我确实没有
No. I don't.

91
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,440
但我知道孩子思念父亲是什么感觉
But I do know what it's like to be a kid missing his dad.

92
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,960
别跟我说你的父亲抛弃了家庭
Please don't tell me your old man abandoned the family.

93
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,340
在我11岁的时候我的双亲都死于了车祸
Both of my parents died in a car accident when I was 11.

94
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,230
肇事的司机喝醉了
Hit by a drunk driver.

95
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,850
天哪  对不起  迈克
Jesus, that's... I'm sorry, Mike.

96
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,260
是啊  那是很久以前的事了
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

97
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,420
凯文  我理解你保护孩子的本能
Kevin, I understand the instinct to protect your children,

98
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,700
但你在保护他们什么呢
but what are you protecting them from?

99
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,530
你什么意思
What do you mean?

100
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,220
我的意思是我们做室友也有段时间了
I mean we've been roommates for a while now.

101
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,890
你不认为也该说说你是为什么进来的吗
Don't you think it's time you told me what you're in here for?

102
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,320
罗斯
Hey, Ross.

103
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,600
你的律师来了
Your lawyer's here.

104
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,190
-现在  -我只是来传个话
- Now? - I'm just the messenger.

105
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,720
你到底出不出来
You want out of this box or not?

106
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,600
贝利先生  我是瑞秋・赞恩
Mr. Bailey, my name is Rachel Zane.

107
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,350
我是哥伦比亚大学法学院的一名学生
I am a law student at Columbia,

108
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,100
我是来和你谈谈你的案子的
and I'm here to talk to you about your case.

109
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,940
学生
Student?

110
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,990
是的  我在负责协助无罪计划
Yes, we work alongside the Innocence Project

111
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,380
决定你的情况是否适合进行上诉
to determine if you have the criteria for an appeal.

112
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,050
你知道我被宣判死刑多久了吗
Do you know how long I've been sittin' on death row?

113
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,040
12年  我读过你的档案
12 years. I read your file.

114
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,620
最近的十年中  我一直在写信
And for the last ten of 'em, I've been writing letters

115
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,200
想找一个愿意听我故事的律师
and begging any lawyer to listen to my story.

116
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,310
他们终于考虑回应我了
And they finally get around to getting back to me,

117
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,530
却都不能出于礼貌的
and they don't even have the courtesy

118
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,470
派个真正的律师来吗
of sendin' me a real lawyer?

119
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,880
贝利先生  相信我  我会为你尽力争取的
Mr. Bailey, trust me, I will fight for you.

120
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,250
你是个学生
You're a student.

121
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,630
你屁都帮不了
You can't do shit for me.

122
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,180
我告诉你  你非常冷血地
Well, you know what? You killed two people.

123
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,180
杀了两个人
In cold blood.

124
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,350
你心知肚明  我也一样
You know it, and I know it,

125
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,740
那也正是你进监狱的原因
and that's why you're in there,

126
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,290
所以谢谢你让我决定
so thank you for making the decision

127
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,450
不把你的案子想得太简单
to not take your case an easy one.

128
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,800
你不了解我
You don't know me.

129
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,940
你所知道的不过是从一些破文件上读来的东西
All you know is what you read in some damn file.

130
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,380
我没杀人
I didn't kill anyone.

131
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,540
这句话我说了12年了
I've been saying it for 12 years

132
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,120
而且我也可以证明
and I can prove it.

133
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,900
你说得对  我不认识你
You're right. I don't know you.

134
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,490
但你也同样不认识我
And you don't know me either.

135
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,950
所以你到底要不要给彼此一个机会
So do you want to take a chance on each other or not?

136
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,150
我需要帮助  赞恩女士
I need help, Ms. Zane.

137
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,610
那就让我来帮你
So let me help you.

138
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,160
哈维  你来这里做什么
Harvey, what are you doing here?

139
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,870
我需要和你谈件事
There's something I need to talk to you about.

140
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,920
坐下
Sit down.

141
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,090
什么事
What is it?

142
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,670
肖恩・卡荷尔刚刚来找了我
I just got a visit from Sean Cahill.

143
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,830
关于加洛的事吗
About Gallo?

144
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,310
你不是说他没办法把他转到其他监狱去吗
I thought you said he can't get him transferred.

145
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,900
的确不能  但后来他发现
He can't, but it turns out

146
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,320
他有办法把你弄出来
there's a way he can get you out.

147
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,370
"出来"是什么意思
What do you mean "out"?

148
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,420
"出来"就是
I mean out,

149
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,510
你可以走出那扇大门
as in you walk out that front door

150
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,020
永远不再回头
and you never look back.

151
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,290
-条件是什么  -迈克...
- What's the catch? - Mike--

152
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,120
哈维  要不是有其他什么条件
Harvey, you're not here telling me that I can get out

153
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,090
你是不会带着那副表情
with that look on your face

154
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,300
来通知我能出去的
if there isn't something else.

155
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,270
他需要你举报你的狱友
He needs you to inform on your cellmate.

156
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,820
什么
What?

157
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,490
假如你套出什么信息能使得他岳父被定罪
If whatever you get leads to a conviction on his father-in-law,

158
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,880
他就会帮你减刑  然后你就可以出来了
he'll commute your sentence and you get to walk.

159
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,380
那家伙干了什么
What'd the guy do?

160
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,560
谁在乎他干了什么啊
Who cares what he did?

161
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,140
我在乎  因为要不是事情很糟糕
I care, because if it was so bad,

162
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,680
凯文一开始就会供出他了
why didn't Kevin turn on him in the first place?

163
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,730
迈克  那又有什么关系呢
Mike, what does it matter?

164
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,640
他能把你弄出去
He can get you out.

165
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,530
他是我在这里唯一的朋友
This is my only friend in here.

166
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,560
我是不会背叛他的
I'm not gonna betray him.

167
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,070
朋友  妈的  听我说
Friend? Listen to me, God damn it.

168
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,850
这里有个人正想办法杀你
There's someone in here trying to kill you

169
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,030
而我正你一个出去的机会
and I'm giving you a way out.

170
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,430
我正在处理加洛了
I'm taking care of Gallo.

171
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,450
那他妈又是什么意思
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

172
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,120
意思是我做了你叫我做的事
It means that I did what you told me to do.

173
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,850
我威胁他说我要告诉大家他是个告密者
I threatened to tell people that he was an informant,

174
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,450
但与此同时我还帮他想了个办法获得假释
but what I also did was found out a way to get him parole.

175
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,180
假释  你疯了吗
Parole? Are you crazy?

176
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,520
他不可能获得假释的
He's not gonna get parole.

177
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,680
谁会批准啊
Who's gonna say he deserves it?

178
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,240
你知道吗  哈维
You know what, Harvey?

179
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,340
与其因为加洛不可能假释
Instead of coming here and telling me to betray my cellmate

180
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,750
就来这里让我背叛我的狱友
because Gallo will never get parole,

181
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,560
也许你更应该帮我让他获得假释
maybe you should be helping me get it for him.

182
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,700
我绝对不会帮那个人渣干任何事情的
I'm never helping that piece of shit do anything,

183
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,520
而且这件事和加洛无关  你是知道的
and this isn't about Gallo and you know it.

184
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,500
的确  这事关你叫我背叛一个我信任的人
No, it's about you telling me to turn on the one guy in here that I trust

185
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,210
就因为卡荷尔提出了一个
based on some plan that Cahill has

186
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,590
我们都不知道行不行得通的计划
that we don't even know will work.

187
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,590
不  迈克
No, Mike.

188
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,730
这事关给你一个机会  重获你
It's about giving you a chance to get your life back

189
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,350
现在还没什么大变化的生活
while it still looks the same.

190
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,960
你到底要不要接受这个条件
Now, are you going to take it or not?

191
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,550
妈的  西梅汁事件又重演了
Son of a bitch, it's the prune juice all over again.

192
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,010
搞什么
What the?

193
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,310
蠢蛋
Hey, douche stick.

194
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,860
是不是你把我的马克杯拿到这里来的
Are you responsible for my mugs being here?

195
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,620
我之前没有...我没有...
I didn't--I don't--

196
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,710
我们没有其他东西可用了
we didn't have anything else to use.

197
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,450
我不管
I don't give a shit!

198
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,570
把这些杯子放回...
Take those things and put 'em back where--

199
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,370
瞧瞧  这不是路易・屎特嘛
Well, if it isn't Louis Shit.

200
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,990
-发生什么事了  老大  -你个混蛋
- What's happening, boss? - You bastard.

201
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,700
你拿了我的马克杯
You took my mugs,

202
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,620
却连亲自动手的胆量都没有
and you didn't even have the balls to do it yourself.

203
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,160
我完全不知道您在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about,

204
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,680
但假如您的东西出现在了这里
but if something of yours is in here,

205
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,600
那和我完全没关系
it had nothing to do with me.

206
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,710
是吗  你为什么不问问这个结巴小丑
Really? Why don't you ask the stuttering ass clown?

207
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,740
我们需要用它们来做我们的...
We needed them for our...

208
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,040
尿检
urine tests.

209
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,610
你刚刚说什么
What'd you say?

210
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,530
你们在我的妙语马克杯里撒尿了
You peed on my catch phrase?

211
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,660
我不知道哪个更搞笑些
I don't know what's funnier--

212
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,820
是你有"妙语"还是我们在里面撒尿了
you got a catch phrase or that we peed on it.

213
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,770
把那些马克杯给我拿去消毒然后销毁
I want those mugs sterilized and I want 'em destroyed.

214
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,980
它们是你的马克杯  你想干啥都行
They're your mugs, you do what you want,

215
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,560
但我打死也不会碰它们的
but I'm not touching 'em with a ten-foot pole.

216
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,900
你知道鲁特曼有多爱吃芦笋吗
You know how much asparagus Luterman eats?

217
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,320
回见  老大
Later, Chief.

218
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,890
今早情况如何
How'd it go this morning?

219
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,220
我被震惊了
I was petrified.

220
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,880
那可是死刑  震惊就对了
Death row. How could you not be?

221
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,590
不止是这个
It's not just that.

222
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,780
到那里的时候  我忽然发现
When I got there, it hit me

223
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,260
假如我接了这个案子
that if I do this,

224
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,660
有一条人命就被握在我手上了
I have a man's life in my hands.

225
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,090
瑞秋  你可以搞定的
Rachel, you can handle it.

226
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,360
我知道我可以
I know I can.

227
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,030
那我为什么感觉你正在为某事烦恼
Then why do I get the feeling that something is bothering you?

228
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,500
因为从那里回来时
Because when I got back from there,

229
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,580
我对那个可怜人的遭遇深感愤怒
I was so angry about what happened to that poor man

230
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,410
所以我坐下  开始办这个案子
that I sat down, I started working on this case,

231
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,350
然后我...我就没动过
and I-- I haven't moved since.

232
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,480
我不明白  这有什么不好的
I don't understand. Why is that bad?

233
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,330
因为这是自迈克离开后
Because it's the first time since Mike left

234
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,560
我第一次没有每分每秒都想着他
that I haven't thought about him every second.

235
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,980
听我说
Listen to me.

236
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,260
这是个好事
That's a good thing.

237
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,900
可我感觉不像是个好事
It doesn't feel like a good thing.

238
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,280
瑞秋  你不能一辈子都活得如坐针毡
Rachel, you can't live your life on pins and needles.

239
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,670
这对你不好
It's not healthy for you.

240
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,510
对迈克也不好  对任何人都不好
It's not healthy for Mike. It's not healthy for anyone.

241
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,790
忘了他就好了吗
And forgetting about him is healthy?

242
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,080
这难道不是你接这个案子的原因吗
Isn't that why you took this case?

243
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,020
来转移你的注意力
To give yourself something to focus on?

244
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,550
-没错  但我  -既然如此就别抗拒
- Yes, but I just-- - Then don't fight it.

245
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,400
如果投入到一个释放无辜人的案子中
If working to free an innocent man helps you

246
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,530
能让你忘了迈克一会
to forget about Mike for a while,

247
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,930
他一定第一个告诉你应该这么做
he would be the first person to tell you to do it.

248
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,770
相信我
And trust me,

249
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
如果你真能沉浸在这个案子里
if you really lose yourself in this,

250
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,400
我觉得等迈克出来的时间感觉起来
I have a feeling it's gonna seem like a lot less than two years

251
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,700
会比两年短多了
before he gets out.

252
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:29,920
哈维在哪
Where's Harvey?

253
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,770
他不在办公室
Harvey's not here.

254
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,830
那就赶紧叫他回来
Well, get his ass in here

255
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,230
因为他和那群商人私下达成了交易
because he made some goddamn side deal

256
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,030
而我现在想让他们赶紧滚
with those traders and I want them out.

257
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,620
路易  我告诉你  现在不是时候
Louis, I am telling you, now is not the time.

258
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,490
那我告诉你  我受不了再多看一天
And I am telling you that I cannot look at

259
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,890
他们那些丑陋愚蠢的脸了
their smug, stupid faces for one more day.

260
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,720
也许你不用看
Maybe you don't have to look at them.

261
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,670
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

262
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,600
路易  我告诉过你
Louis, did I ever tell you

263
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,640
-我在纽约住的第一套公寓吗  -没有
- about my first apartment in the city? - No.

264
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,190
我和别人合租一个37平米的单间公寓
I was sharing a 400 square-foot studio

265
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,920
那简直是个噩梦  直到我们决定
and it was a disaster until we finally decided

266
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,760
隔开房间保留隐私才好一些
that we had to separate our spaces for privacy.

267
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,180
这可不是《布雷迪家庭》  唐娜
Well, this isn't "The Brady Bunch," Donna.

268
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,630
我们不可能在办公室中央画一个三八线
We can't put a masking tape line down the center of the office.

269
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,520
我不是说让你画三八线  路易
I'm not talking about masking tape, Louis.

270
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,610
我是想说雇一个建筑师
I am talking about hiring an architect

271
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,330
重新规划办公室布局
to reconfigure the offices.

272
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,030
你说得太对了
You're right!

273
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,260
我们甚至可以重新装修
We can even do a remodel,

274
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,230
这是我过去五年里一直想做的
which is what I've been wanting to do for the last five years.

275
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,840
最重要的是  你不用再和
And the best part is, you don't have to deal with

276
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,740
那些混蛋商人打交道了
those asshole traders ever again.

277
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,130
-唐娜你简直是个天才  -我知道
- Donna, you're a genius. - I know.

278
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,020
午饭之前给我六个建筑师的名字
Get me the names of six architects before lunch.

279
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,490
路易  你有自己的秘书
Louis, you have your own secretary.

280
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,610
谢谢你这么没用
Thanks for nothing.

281
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,950
我图个什么
Why do I even?

282
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,230
你可算来了
Nice of you to show up.

283
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,500
这些土豆都是我一个人削的
Been peeling these potatoes by myself.

284
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,290
对不起  我刚才有事
Sorry, I...got caught up.

285
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,160
对了  你和你律师谈得如何
Speaking of which, how'd it go with your lawyer?

286
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,890
你要出去了吗
You gettin' out of here?

287
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,640
什么
What?

288
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,980
我开玩笑的  有什么事吗
I'm just kidding. So what's going on?

289
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,980
没什么
Nothing.

290
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,010
不重要
It's not important.

291
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,090
你律师来你都不知道
Your lawyer shows up without you knowing about it

292
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,780
这事还能不重要吗
and it's not important?

293
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,710
拜托  你以为我是三岁小孩
Come on, do I look like I was born yesterday?

294
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,320
我说了不重要
I just said it is not important.

295
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,640
对不起我留你一个人在这干活
And I'm sorry I left you hanging,

296
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,170
但要不是我你都没有这份工作
but you wouldn't even have this job without me.

297
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,450
要不是因为你我也不需要工作
I wouldn't even need this job if it weren't for you.

298
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,960
你到底怎么了
So what's your problem?

299
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,890
对不起  凯文  我...
I'm sorry, Kevin, I'm...

300
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,770
我今天过得不顺
I'm just not having a good day.

301
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,470
没事
Hey, it's okay.

302
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,380
别担心  好吗
Don't sweat it. All right?

303
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,870
反正这事与我无关
I mean, it's none of my business anyway.

304
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,080
不  其实  和你有关
No, actually, it is your business.

305
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,060
他来告诉我他想过办法让加洛转监狱
He came here to tell me that he tried to get Gallo transferred,

306
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,380
但...看来不可能了
but...it's not gonna happen.

307
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,240
只要咱俩统一战线
Well, as long as we stick together,

308
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,200
我们也能对付加洛  对吧
we can deal with Gallo anyway, right?

309
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,880
对  我就是这么跟哈维说的
Yeah, that's-- that's what I told Harvey.

310
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,770
好吧
Right.

311
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,200
下次再见到他  替我跟他说谢谢他的努力
Next time you talk to him, tell him I said thanks for trying.

312
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,230
怎么样
How'd it go?

313
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,910
他说他要考虑一下
He said he had to think about it.

314
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,570
什么  为什么
What? Why?

315
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,350
因为他愚蠢至极
'Cause he's an idiot, that's why.

316
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,750
那你接下来要怎么办
So what're you gonna do?

317
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,730
我要想办法争取点时间
I'm gonna figure out how to buy us some time.

318
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,020
那你最好快点想  因为卡荷尔在你办公室
Well, you better do it fast because Cahill's in your office

319
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,270
他等着答复
and he wants an answer.

320
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,610
肖恩
Sean.

321
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,880
他怎么说
What'd he say?

322
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,030
他说想看到详细的书面文件
Said he wants to see the details in writing.

323
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,150
我没这闲情逸致  哈维
I'm not in the mood, Harvey.

324
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,480
我也没在瞎说
And I'm not messing around.

325
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,680
快告诉我你是开玩笑的
Please tell me you're kidding me.

326
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,430
拜托  简直扯淡
Oh, come on, this is bullshit.

327
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,510
你知道我说话算数的
You know my word is good.

328
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,790
我知道  我就是这么告诉他的
Yeah, and I told him that,

329
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,890
但他不想冒着背腹受敌的风险
and he doesn't want to risk putting a target on his back

330
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,510
最后却发现所谓减刑
and then find out commuting his sentence

331
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,970
真的只是减了一半刑期而已
really means cutting it in half.

332
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,210
他不用承担任何风险
He's not risking anything.

333
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,250
没人会发现
No one's gonna find out.

334
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,640
我敢说弗兰克・加洛之前也是这么想的
I'm sure that's exactly what Frank Gallo thought.

335
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,420
要么你拿来书面文件  要么这事就没戏了
So either put it in writing or we don't have a deal.

336
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,700
他不同意  对不对
He didn't go for it, did he?

337
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,340
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

338
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,730
迈克承不承担风险和
Mike being at risk has nothing to do

339
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,180
书面文件毫无关系
with putting anything in writing.

340
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,190
而且你告诉过我他不会同意的
And you told me he wouldn't go for it,

341
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,520
哈维  跟我说实话吧
so Harvey... tell me the truth.

342
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,230
好吧  他拒绝了
All right, he said no.

343
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,220
但是肖恩  我跟你说  他会回心转意的
But Sean, I'm telling you, he'll come around.

344
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,270
他只是需要几天时间考虑
He just needs a couple of days.

345
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,770
你知道为了让这件事开始进行
Do you know how many strings I pulled

346
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,900
我找了多少关系吗
to put this thing in motion?

347
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,080
我所知道的是  如果这个案子对你来说
What I know is, you wouldn't have pulled anything

348
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,530
不是非常重要你根本不会去找关系
if this case wasn't huge for you.

349
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,730
所以与其因为我说这还需要几天时间
So instead of yelling at me

350
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,140
就对我大吼大叫
for saying that it's gonna take a couple days,

351
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,980
你还不如痛快地给我几天时间
why don't you just give me a couple of days?

352
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,340
好的  哈维
Okay, Harvey.

353
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,770
协议依然有效
The deal's still on the table.

354
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,900
但如果我找到无需他的帮助也能继续的办法
But if I find a way to move forward without his help,

355
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,280
那协议立刻作废  他就要坐满两年牢了
there is no deal and he does the whole two years.

356
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,280
杰西卡
Jessica.

357
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,210
哈维
Harvey.

358
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,570
迈克怎么样了
What's going on with Mike?

359
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,610
我把卡荷尔的提议告诉他了
I gave him Cahill's offer.

360
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,090
他在考虑吗
And he's thinking about it?

361
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:18,970
我还在努力
I'm working on it.

362
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,750
在此期间  你不在的时候
Well, in the meantime, while you were out,

363
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,430
我接到了一通来自南森・巴恩斯的电话
I got a call from Nathan Burns.

364
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,280
他觉得有人正试图接管他的公司
He thinks someone's trying to take over his company.

365
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,160
他为什么会这么想
Why the hell would he think of that?

366
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,550
因为坊间传言称
Because word on the street is,

367
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,290
某人正在抛售一批他的股票
someone's selling off a block of his stock.

368
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,380
这完全说不通啊
That doesn't make sense.

369
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,610
我们从他那把萨特持有的股份买过来了
We bought Sutter's shares from him.

370
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,100
那些该死的交易员们
Those goddamn traders.

371
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,750
不可能
No way.

372
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,220
他们不会在不知会我的情况下这么做的
They wouldn't do that without telling me.

373
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,170
他们是很有诚信的买下来的
They bought it in good faith.

374
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,320
那么他们现在就是在很没诚信的抛售了
Well, they're dumping it in bad faith.

375
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,270
-这事我来处理  -不
- I'll take care of it-- - No.

376
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,200
你专心处理迈克的事情
You have your hands full with Mike.

377
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,170
这事我能搞定
I can handle this.

378
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,230
杰西卡  让他们加入进来是我的主意
Jessica, it was my idea to involve them.

379
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,660
应该由我来收拾残局
I should be the one to take care of it.

380
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,480
我不在乎那是谁的主意  哈维
I don't care whose idea it was, Harvey.

381
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,000
你把迈克的事情处理好
You take care of Mike.

382
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,550
喂
Hello?

383
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,150
丹伯里联邦监狱有人向你致电
You have a call from Danbury Federal Prison.

384
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,700
-你愿意承担费用吗  -愿意
- Do you accept the charges? - Yes, of course.

385
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,820
迈克  一切安好吗
Mike, is everything okay?

386
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,500
是的  是的  一切都好
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

387
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,390
我只是想你了
I was just thinking about you.

388
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,180
我也在想你
I was thinking about you too.

389
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,890
你也是吗
You were?

390
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,630
是的  实际上  我刚正在和你进行
Yes, in fact, I was just in the middle

391
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,380
一场关于死刑上诉案的
of a heated discussion with you

392
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,370
最佳解决方案的热烈讨论之中
about the best way to handle a death row appeal.

393
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,440
我不大明白
I don't understand.

394
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,480
我接受了"无罪计划"的案子
I took on an Innocence Project case,

395
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,910
就想找点事做把心思从我们这一团乱麻中移开
just to have something to take my mind off of our troubles.

396
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,050
但是我  我不想把心思从你身上移开
But I...I didn't want to take my mind off of you.

397
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,540
所以我决定想象和你一起解决这个案子
So I figured I would just imagine we were working on it together.

398
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,890
我都不知道该说些什么了
I don't know what to say.

399
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,820
说你愿意加入
Say you're in.

400
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,710
我是说  那取决于我们决定采用什么样的策略
I mean, that depends on what strategy we landed on.

401
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,130
迈克  说真的  出了什么事吗
Mike, seriously, is there something wrong?

402
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,410
不  我只是想确保你一切安好
No, I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay.

403
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,700
还有  我们的感情依然没变
And that... that we were still good.

404
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,930
现在我有一件事可以让我不想我们的窘境
Now that I have something to take my mind off our situation

405
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,590
并且同时还能把我俩联系在一起
and connect me to you at the same time,

406
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,290
是的  我们的感情更好了
yeah, we're better than good.

407
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,730
好了  你能帮我转一下唐娜的分机吗
All right, can you do me a favor and transfer me to Donna?

408
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,690
当然  我能问下为什么吗
Of course. Can I ask why?

409
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,410
我只能打一个电话
I only get one phone call,

410
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,900
而我非常确定你这个想象我们一起
and I'm pretty sure she had something to do

411
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,750
工作的点子她有一份功劳
with the idea of you imagining us working together,

412
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,480
所以我想谢谢她
so I just want to thank her.

413
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,580
好的  我爱你
Okay. I love you.

414
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,770
我也爱你
I love you too.

415
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,050
喂
Hello?

416
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,000
唐娜  迈克在线上
Donna, I have Mike on the phone.

417
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,000
接过来
Put him through.

418
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,340
-喂  -唐娜
- Hello? - Donna.

419
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,610
如果哈维在公司  帮我个忙
If Harvey's there, do me a favor--

420
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,570
小点声  别告诉他是我打过来的
keep your voice down, and don't tell him it's me.

421
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,650
迈克  怎么了
Mike, what's going on?

422
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,480
我不会接受那份协议的  唐娜
I'm not taking the deal, Donna.

423
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,760
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

424
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,040
事情没那么简单
It's not that simple.

425
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,780
什么没那么简单  哈维说如果你
What's not simple about it? Harvey said that if you--

426
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,010
我不在乎哈维是怎么说的
I don't care what Harvey said.

427
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,140
因为他没告诉你们的是
Because what he didn't say

428
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,460
如果我按他的吩咐做了而被人发现了的话
is that if I do what he wants and someone finds out,

429
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,010
那我可能永远也回不到瑞秋身边了
then I may never get back to Rachel at all.

430
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,510
哈维是绝对不会让他们发现的
Harvey would never let them find out--

431
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,410
唐娜  听着  我打电话给你
Donna, look, I called you

432
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,070
是因为我不想和他争论这件事
so that I didn't want to have this argument with him.

433
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,400
我时间不多了
Now, I don't have much time.

434
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,560
你到底要不要帮我
Are you gonna do this for me or not?

435
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,730
我会和他说的
I'll tell him.

436
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,900
那么我还需要你帮我跟他说点别的
Then I also need you to tell him something else for me.

437
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,950
如果他要跑过来试图改变我的想法
If he comes here to try to change my mind,

438
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,840
我是不会见他的
I'm not gonna see him.

439
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,550
你介意告诉我到底是谁说你可以在不知会
You mind telling me who the hell said

440
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,380
我们的情况下抛售南森・巴恩斯的股票的吗
you can dump Nathan Burns' stock without talking to us?

441
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,230
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

442
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,460
南森・巴恩斯是谁
Who's Nathan Burns?

443
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,070
外达因能源公司的首席执行官
CEO of Exodyne.

444
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,100
那位南森・巴恩斯啊
Oh, that Nathan Burns.

445
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,290
那样的话  我要说我可以抛售那些股票
In that case, I said I could sell that stock

446
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,570
因为它们归我所有
because I own it.

447
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,460
就是这个  这个  还有这个都归我所有一样
Just like I own this one and this one and this one.

448
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,460
瞧瞧  我的纽宝客投资股价
Look at that, my Neubacher Capital position's

449
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,720
正在暴涨了
going through the roof.

450
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,600
你心知肚明  你跟哈维之间不是这样约定的
That's not the deal you made with Harvey and you know it.

451
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,660
这就是复杂又庞大的华尔街生活
Welcome to the big, bad world of Wall Street.

452
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,190
你是有事要谈  还是我可以继续工作了
Now, do you want something or can I get back to work?

453
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,980
我有事要谈
I want something.

454
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,420
你要解除那笔交易并买回那些股份
You're going to unwind that sale and buy those shares back.

455
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,290
溢价发行  想都别想
At a premium? Not gonna happen.

456
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,310
我是你的房东
I'm your landlord.

457
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,410
然而你之所以出于无奈把办公室租给我
And the fact you had to lease to me

458
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,990
就是因为你们没什么生意
means you don't have much of an operation.

459
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,690
听我说  你这个蠢货
You listen to me, you little pissant.

460
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,900
你根本不知道自己在跟谁打交道
You don't know who you're messing with.

461
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,290
那为何不让我自己来了解
Then why don't I find out?

462
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,410
通过晚餐来了解
Over dinner?

463
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,120
开什么玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

464
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,400
你把让我跟你共进晚餐
You want me to have dinner with you

465
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,110
作为你退出交易的条件
in exchange for backing off that trade?

466
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,090
我认为只有你想跟我共进晚餐
I think of it as you get to have dinner with me

467
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,760
我才会考虑是否会退出交易
and I choose to back off that trade

468
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,070
因为我很厉害
'cause I am a standup guy.

469
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,460
有些话要跟你说清楚  斯图
Well, let me let you in on a little something there, Stu.

470
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,650
我不会和要挟我的人共进晚餐
I don't share dinner staring down the barrel of a shotgun.

471
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,750
所以你还是先退出交易再来约我吃饭吧
So why don't you unwind that trade and then ask me out?

472
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,410
然后我们就会知道
And then we'll see if you're as charming

473
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,680
你究竟是否像你说得那样魅力十足
as you like to think you are.

474
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,720
我很有魅力
You know what? I am charming.

475
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,690
但我不是个傻子
But I'm not an idiot.

476
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,870
不让我尝到甜头
And I'm not unwinding my trade

477
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,540
我是不会退出交易的
without getting something in return.

478
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,350
哈维  我有事要跟你谈
Harvey, I need to talk to you about something

479
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,420
但这事会让你很反感
and you're not going to like it.

480
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,400
关于什么
About what?

481
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,010
我刚才跟迈克通了电话
That was Mike on the phone before.

482
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,560
那你怎么没叫我
Why didn't you get me?

483
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,060
他不打算接受交易了  哈维
He's not taking the deal, Harvey.

484
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,300
他敢
The hell he isn't.

485
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,590
你要去哪
Where are you going?

486
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,250
去他监狱
To that prison.

487
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,930
哈维  他之所以把电话打给了我而不是你
Harvey, the reason he called me and not you

488
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,060
就是因为他知道你不会同意他拒绝交易的
is because he knew you wouldn't take no for an answer.

489
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,190
我的确不同意
And I'm not going to.

490
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,950
因此他跟我说  如果你去监狱
Which is why he said if you show up there,

491
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,510
他是不会走出牢房见你的
he's not gonna leave his cell.

492
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,860
那就把瑞秋叫来
Then get me Rachel.

493
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,990
不  哈维  你不能告诉她
No, no, Harvey, you cannot tell her.

494
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,040
为什么不能
Like hell I can't.

495
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,640
她是唯一能说服他的人
She's the only one who can convince him.

496
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,660
如果你告诉她  迈克不接受
If you tell her that Mike's not taking a deal

497
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,300
能让他出狱的交易
that can get him out,

498
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,650
她会因此崩溃的
it'll tear her apart.

499
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,630
但如果我不告诉她
And if I don't tell her,

500
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,450
他就还要多坐两年牢
he's gonna be in there for two more years.

501
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,400
这难道是她想要的结果吗
Is that what she wants?

502
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,200
那是他们之间的事
That's between them.

503
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,250
因此我才想告诉她
That's why I want to tell her.

504
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,470
她就会做出权衡
She'll make it between them.

505
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,390
哈维
Harvey.

506
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,420
真可恶  他只是跟这家伙下过盘棋
God damn it, he plays checkers with this guy

507
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,570
就觉得自己的命是人家给的了
and thinks he owes him his life.

508
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,250
不  你明知道这么说对他很不公平
No, that's not fair and you know it,

509
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,750
要不是迈克忠心耿耿  现在坐牢的就是你了
because Mike's loyalty is the reason you're not in prison.

510
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
这才是让我最痛不欲生的  唐娜
That's what's killing me, Donna,

511
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,730
你不明白吗
don't you understand?

512
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,280
他去替我坐牢
He's in there instead of me

513
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,130
还要面对一个被我弄进监狱的人
with a guy I put away,

514
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,880
因此当他有机会能出狱时
and I can't just sit here doing nothing

515
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,510
我不能在一旁坐视不管
when he has a chance to get out.

516
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,180
所以你才得想个别的办法出来
Which is why you have to think of something else.

517
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,280
因为一旦你把这事告诉瑞秋
Because if you tell Rachel about this,

518
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,440
那么迈克出狱后的生活...
the life that's waiting for Mike when he gets out...

519
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,860
就不会那么美好了
it isn't going to be there.

520
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,800
哈维  居然这么快又见面了
Harvey. I'm surprised to see you here so soon.

521
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,400
我没想到你这么快就说服了他
I didn't think you'd turn him this fast.

522
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,160
我需要更多的时间
I need more time.

523
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,300
我想你还是没明白我的意思
I don't think you understand.

524
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,360
我正顶着被派去调查其他案件的压力
I'm being pressured to move to another investigation.

525
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,200
给你24小时让他改变主意不然一切免谈
You've got 24 hours to change his mind or this thing is done.

526
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,770
那我需要你帮我办件事
Then I need you to do something for me.

527
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,010
我现在就是在帮你办事
I am doing something for you.

528
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,310
我在想办法让迈克出狱
I'm getting Mike out of prison.

529
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
你要帮我办点别的事
Well, you need to do something else for me

530
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
否则这事成不了
or that's never gonna happen.

531
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,850
你这话什么意思
What are you talking about?

532
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,310
我想让你去跟他谈
I need you to get into a room with him

533
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,590
因为他听不进去我的话
because he won't listen to what I have to say.

534
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,970
你到底想让我跟他说什么
What exactly do you want me to tell him

535
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,230
还有什么是你没跟他说的
that you haven't already?

536
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,690
肖恩  迈克愿意当老好人
Sean, Mike's a bleeding heart.

537
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,810
你要让他亲自了解这个案子
You need to make the case directly to him.

538
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,720
不管这人干了什么  你得让他看到受害者
He needs to see the victims of whatever the hell this guy did.

539
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,860
这主意不错  哈维
That's a swell idea, Harvey,

540
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,780
但如果有人发现我去了那监狱
but if I go into that prison and someone sees me,

541
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,140
不仅我们会陷入绝境
not only are we dead in the water,

542
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,580
同时迈克的性命也会变得一文不值
but Mike's life isn't worth shit.

543
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,900
你以为这些道理我不明白吗
You think I don't know that?

544
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,250
这道理我都不懂  我还来干什么
What the hell do you think I'm doing here?

545
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,240
什么意思
What are you talking about?

546
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,410
我有个计划
I have a plan.

547
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,610
但你不会喜欢这计划的
But you're not gonna like it.

548
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,190
为什么
Why not?

549
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,010
因为我想让你再找层关系
Because I need you to pull another string,

550
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,460
并且要在弗兰克・加洛
and I need you to do it before

551
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,120
想出别的招数对付迈克之前完成
Frank Gallo tries something else with Mike.

552
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,990
好了  冒牌律师
All right, fake lawyer.

553
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,360
检验你本事的时刻到了
Let's see what you got.

554
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,690
你想让我帮你查查看吗
You're gonna let me look into it for you?

555
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,520
调查  才不是
Look into it? Shit.

556
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,410
你要履行承诺  把我弄出狱
You're gonna get me out of here like you promised.

557
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,270
我从没保证过
I never promised.

558
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,580
我说的是你有一个绝佳机会
I said there was an excellent chance

559
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,250
-可以...  -六周  哥们
- that you could get-- - Six weeks, brother.

560
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,870
我会数日子的
I'll be counting the days.

561
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,260
明天一早我就提交动议
I'll file the motion first thing in the morning.

562
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,260
小子很机灵嘛
There you go.

563
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,810
这就对了
That's what I'm talking about.

564
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,110
我要是发现你在搞我
And if I find out you're screwing me on any level,

565
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,220
你最好在监狱里的某个黑暗角落打个洞
you better hole up in some dark corner of this prison,

566
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,420
祈祷不会被我捉到
pray to God I don't find your ass.

567
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,370
什么情况
What was that all about?

568
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,480
看来他最终还是接受了我的提议
Looks like he took me up on my offer after all.

569
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,330
该死  格蕾琴  她到底在哪
God damn it, Gretchen, where the hell is she?

570
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,180
谁到底在哪
Where the hell is who?

571
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,880
那个你要联系的建筑师
That architect you were supposed to call.

572
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,310
她还要半个小时才到
She's not supposed to be here for another half hour.

573
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,950
如果是我要跟某人做生意
And if I want someone's business,

574
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,940
我至少会提前半个小时到
I show up a half-hour early at the latest.

575
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,650
那你到底要我怎么解决
And what exactly are you looking to have me do

576
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,070
你的小难题
about your little conundrum?

577
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,460
我要你打给她
I want you to give her a call

578
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,260
告诉她如果她连早点赴约的基本礼节
and tell her if she doesn't have the goddamn common courtesy

579
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,310
都不知道
to show up early,

580
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,790
干脆就别来了
then she might as well not show up at all.

581
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,940
-利特先生  -我...
- Mr. Litt. - I--

582
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,130
-你是  -我是塔拉・梅瑟
- Y-yes? - I'm Tara Messer.

583
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,080
我是来商讨你们的改建需求的
I'm here to discuss your remodel needs.

584
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,910
我的需求吗
My needs?

585
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,570
抱歉  本将被我们任聘的建筑师小姐
Well, I'm sorry, Ms. Was-Going-to-Be-Our-Architect.

586
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,900
我们不需要你的服务了
We no longer need your service.

587
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,950
格蕾琴  冷静
Gretchen, calm down.

588
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,990
你反应这么强烈  就像个疯女人一样
You are overreacting like a crazy woman.

589
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,010
你被聘请了
You're hired.

590
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,090
是吗
I am?

591
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,590
是的  你就是合适人选
Oh, yeah. You're right for the job.

592
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,590
我可以感觉到
I can feel it.

593
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,480
你是那里有感觉吧  呵呵
You can feel something, all right.

594
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,810
那先说说你想要 
Then why don't we start with

595
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,400
什么样的空间风格吧
what you're looking for in the space?

596
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,110
空间
Space.

597
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,200
对  就是空间
Right, the space. Exactly.

598
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,990
我想在我们和承租人的办公室之间
What I'm looking for are clear yet unobtrusive boundaries

599
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,600
划一条清晰但又不突兀的界限
between our offices and the tenants'.

600
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,120
这个界限得高雅自然
But it needs to be elegant and organic

601
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,830
不然还不如不弄
or we might as well not do it at all.

602
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,990
我知道了
I understand.

603
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,980
就像一首动听的歌剧  无缝自然地
Like the perfect aria leading seamlessly

604
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,760
进入那必然的尾声一样
to its inevitable cadenza.

605
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,990
你是歌剧爱好者吗
You're an opera lover?

606
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,120
仅次于芭蕾
Second only to the ballet.

607
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,550
那我们先结婚吧
Then I suggest we start with a marriage.

608
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,580
我是说参观
I mean a tour.

609
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,280
抱歉  邓巴教授
Excuse me, Professor Dunbar.

610
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,100
您有时间吗
Do you have a moment?

611
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,590
这是教员休息室  赞恩小姐
This is the faculty lounge, Ms. Zane.

612
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,850
你不能到这里来
You're not supposed to be in here.

613
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,360
我知道  我也很抱歉
I understand that, and I'm sorry.

614
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,970
只是这件事很重要  而您又不在办公室
It's just this is important and you weren't in your office.

615
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,910
有什么事
What can I do for you?

616
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,050
我昨天和伦纳德・贝利见面了
I met with Leonard Bailey yesterday.

617
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,570
-他是那个死囚犯  -我知道他是谁
- He's the inmate on death-- - I know who he is.

618
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,390
-有问题吗  -有
- Is there a problem? - Yes, there is.

619
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,680
他被关到了死囚区  但他是无辜的
He's rotting on death row for a crime that he didn't commit.

620
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,840
你才见他十分钟
So you met with him for ten minutes

621
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,230
你就准备放了他吗
and you're ready to release him?

622
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,070
不  我的意思是
No, what I'm saying is--

623
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,970
你只是一个二年级法学生  瑞秋
You're a second-year law student, Rachel.

624
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,320
我叫你加入
I asked you to be a part of this

625
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,700
是因为你是我最聪明的学生之一
because you're one of my brightest students,

626
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,120
但是我特别叫你加入的原因
but I also asked you in particular

627
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,130
是我认为你不是一个如此天真的人
because I didn't think you'd be so naive.

628
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:53,980
什么
Excuse me?

629
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,270
你的工作不是跟贝利先生谈过一次后
Your job wasn't to talk to Mr. Bailey once

630
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,350
就被他的悲伤故事所动容
and, after being moved by his tale of woe,

631
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,330
然后就把他的案子放在最前面
tell me to jump him to the top of the pile.

632
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,780
你要做的是评估案件  并提供证据
It was to assess his case and present evidence.

633
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,390
我现在就是在这样做啊
And that's exactly what I'm doing here.

634
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,590
我刚把两箱教科书式的起诉不当文件
I just left two boxes of textbook prosecutorial misconduct

635
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,000
交给你的秘书了
with your secretary.

636
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,500
你在昨天一天之内收集到的吗
You found all of that since yesterday?

637
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,260
是啊  我或许只是个法学二年级生
Yes, because while I may only be a second-year law student,

638
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,840
但是我已经当过八年的法律助理了
I have been a practicing paralegal for the past eight years.

639
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,680
这么说  我有很多东西要看了啊
Looks like I have some reading to do.

640
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,190
抱歉打扰您了
I'm sorry for interrupting your day.

641
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,910
午安  赞恩小姐
Good afternoon, Ms. Zane.

642
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,810
午安  教授
Good afternoon, Professor.

643
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,470
那我们就用已有的玻璃图案
And then we use the glass motif you already have

644
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,080
来隔开你们和他们的空间
to partition their space from yours

645
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,880
就从那边那堵墙开始
starting at that wall over there.

646
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,580
没有人会发现它们是隔开的
And no one ever knows they're two separate entities.

647
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,780
如果我们用磨砂玻璃
And if we use the frosted glass,

648
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,840
你根本就不会看到他们
you'll never even have to lay eyes on them.

649
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,540
还有件事
Well, there's just one more thing.

650
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,630
你想知道
You want to know

651
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,810
我是否能给你这边再设计一个大办公室吗
if I can design another bullpen area for your side.

652
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,770
毕竟  那是这个地方的灵魂
After all, it's the heart and soul of the space.

653
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,710
这都猜得到
You get that?

654
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,310
这是我的工作要求
It's my job to get that.

655
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,050
我不懂
I don't understand.

656
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,230
对我来说  建筑不仅仅关乎设计
To me, architecture isn't just about design.

657
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,990
还要求我和客户
It's--it's about connecting with my clients

658
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,500
建立亲密的关系
on an intimate level.

659
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,100
那你真是太擅长了
 Well, you're very good at it.

660
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,990
真是太遗憾了
And you know, it's too bad

661
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,540
你已经转租给别人
you already sublet to someone else.

662
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,720
我们也希望扩展来着
We're looking to expand ourselves.

663
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,600
这个地方真是太合适了
This space would have been perfect.

664
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,560
-你说真的吗  -当然
- Are you serious? - Yeah.

665
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,730
实际上  太完美了
In fact, it's so perfect,

666
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,710
我可能会当场就给你报价
I would have made you an offer on the spot.

667
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,170
不论如何  我会尽快做出一些草图的
Anyway, I'll have some plans drawn up as soon as I can.

668
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,340
-我们得赶走那些交易员  -你说什么
- We need to get rid of those traders. - Excuse me?

669
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,240
我不管你和哈维与他们达成了
I don't care what kind of deal

670
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,100
怎样的协议
you and Harvey cut with them.

671
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,900
我们得把他们赶走
We need to get rid of them

672
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,190
而且必须现在就赶走
and we need to do it now.

673
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,760
路易  我不会这么做的
Well, Louis, I'm not going to do that

674
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,390
反正无论我们把他们换成谁
because whoever we replace them with,

675
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,240
这种事情总是会再发生
this conversation is just going to happen again.

676
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,690
因为你我心里都清楚  你已经疯了
Because we both know that you're out of your mind.

677
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,570
不会再发生的
It's not gonna happen again

678
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,050
因为在这件事上  我很清醒
because in this particular case, I am not out of my mind.

679
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,110
你为什么要我这么做呢
Why do you want me to do this?

680
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,620
因为我爱上了一个建筑师
Because I'm in love with an architect.

681
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,080
来让我先搞清楚状况
Let me get this straight.

682
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,670
你要我对那些已经和我开战的人们
You want me to further antagonize people

683
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,770
展开更进一步的对抗  
that I'm already fighting with

684
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,640
就因为你没胆量
because you don't have the balls

685
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,980
约一个女人出来
to ask a woman out on a date?

686
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,800
你也可以这么理解
That's one way of looking at it.

687
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,730
不  还有一个角度
No, there's another way.

688
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,490
-我不答应  -无所谓
- The answer is no. - Okay, fine.

689
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,950
我按原计划进行就好了
I'll just stick to the original plan

690
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,660
让她整个重新设计我们的办公室
of having her completely redesign our space,

691
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,720
而且我会保证她的工期能够
and I'll just make sure it takes long enough

692
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,930
长到让她能够疯狂地爱上我
for her to fall madly in love with me,

693
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,670
反正不会超过两三年
and it shouldn't take more than two or three years.

694
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,130
路易  你一字一句给我听清楚
Louis, I want you to look at me when I say this.

695
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,060
如果你雇这个女人
If you hire this woman to do anything

696
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,940
来做和公司办公室相关的任何事情
relating to this firm's space,

697
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,310
我会亲自把你从楼顶上扔下去
I will personally throw you off the roof this building.

698
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,380
明白了吗
Is that clear?

699
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,740
-也就是说你会至少考虑一下吗  -出去
- So you'll think about it? - Get out.

700
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,110
阿诺
Ahnold.

701
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,300
来  看看你有什么料
Come on. Let's see what you got.

702
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,360
我不知道你之前玩过
I didn't know you played.

703
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,750
之前玩过  屁啦
Played? Shit.

704
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,820
我破过P.S. 092单场得分纪录
I set the P.S. 092 single-game scoring record.

705
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,310
P.S. 092是个小学啊  哥们儿
P.S. 092 is an elementary school, my friend.

706
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,350
对  六年级  我掌控全场
Yeah, sixth grade. I dominated.

707
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,950
听说你要帮加洛的假释提交动议
Heard you had to file that motion for Gallo's parole.

708
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,470
-提交了  -已经提交了
- I did. - Already?

709
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,890
不过是个十八页的判决修正而已
It was an 18-page sentencing amendment.

710
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,400
我睡着觉都能弄好
I could do that in my sleep.

711
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,140
那么高效  得让你帮我干活才行
I should get you to do some work for me.

712
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,550
为什么  你需要我吗
Why? You need some?

713
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,880
还没  但是如果我需要的话  
No, but if I did, I'd probably get myself a lawyer

714
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,400
也会找个监狱外面的律师
who didn't sleep in a prison.

715
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,490
你没事吧
You all right?

716
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,530
我不知道
I don't--I don't know.

717
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,940
什么叫我不知道
What do you mean, you don't know?

718
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,340
究竟怎么了  你的胃怎么了吗
What is it, your stomach?

719
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,680
天  不太对劲
my God, something's not right.

720
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,560
深呼吸
Take a deep breath.

721
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,590
低下头
Put your head down.

722
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,870
天啊  不行  没用的
God, I can't-- that's not gonna do anything.

723
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,590
我想
I think...

724
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,180
天啊  我想有人对我
My God, I think somebody

725
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,260
动手脚了
did something to me.

726
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,740
快来帮忙
Can I get some help over here?

727
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,520
警卫
Guard!

728
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,620
迈克  和我说话
Mike, talk to me.

729
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,560
是加洛做的
It's Gallo.

730
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,960
他肯定动了手脚  在我的
Yeah, he must've put something in my--

731
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,700
快来帮忙  警卫
Somebody do something! Guard!

732
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,790
打电话给哈维
Call Harvey.

733
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,070
警卫
Guard!

734
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,740
迈克  迈克
Mike. Mike!

735
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,720
他在哪里
Where is he?

736
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,720
如果我知道你说的是谁  或许我可以
If I knew who you were talking about, maybe I could--

737
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,430
迈克・罗斯  我现在就要见他
Mike Ross. I need to see him right now.

738
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,430
你是
And who are you?

739
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,450
哈维・斯佩克特  他的律师
Harvey Specter. I'm his attorney.

740
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,610
罗斯先生现在在医务室里
Mr. Ross is in the infirmary,

741
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,070
然而你不能去那里见他
but you can't see him in there.

742
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,500
那就把典狱长给我找来
Then get me the warden.

743
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,270
我不喜欢别人逼着做事  斯佩克特先生
I don't appreciate being pushed around, Mr. Specter.

744
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,200
我不关心
I don't care.

745
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,440
我想要全世界都知道今天这儿发生了什么
I want everyone to know what happened here today.

746
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,550
发生的事情他们都看到了
They saw what happened.

747
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,100
看到和知道还是有区别的
Yeah, there's a difference between seeing and knowing.

748
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,930
你是凯文・米勒
You Kevin Miller?

749
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,740
你是谁
Who are you?

750
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,630
哈维・斯佩克特
Harvey Specter.

751
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,840
迈克・罗斯的律师
I'm Mike Ross's lawyer.

752
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,920
我已经告诉典狱长
Look, I already told the warden

753
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,210
我没看到任何人动了他的食物
I didn't see anyone touch his food.

754
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,710
你看到过弗兰克・加洛和他在一起吗
Did you see Frank Gallo with him?

755
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,360
看到还是没看到
Did you or didn't you?

756
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,610
你这是要害死我吗
Are you trying to get me killed, man?

757
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,110
他动了他的食物没
Did he touch his food or not?

758
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,620
好吧  他动了  昨晚晚餐的时候
Yeah, he did, last night at dinner.

759
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,280
但是迈克提议帮加洛假释
But Mike offered to get Gallo parole

760
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,280
加洛也答应了  为什么还要加害于他
and Gallo took him up on it, so why would he poison him?

761
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,740
因为他并没有真的答应迈克
Because he didn't really take Mike up on that offer.

762
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,440
他答应只是为了接近他
He just did it to get close to him.

763
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,850
或者是为了让迈克知道如果他出不去
Or he did it to give Mike a taste of what happens

764
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,920
究竟会发生什么
if he doesn't come through.

765
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,480
无论怎样  你离那个混蛋远点
Either way, you stay the hell away from that son of a bitch.

766
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,320
好了  够了  我们走吧
All right, that's enough. Let's go.

767
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,860
律师
Counselor!

768
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,490
我听说你家小孩在院子里犯了个小胃痛
I heard your boy had a little tummy ache out in the yard.

769
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,300
你个人渣
You piece of shit.

770
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,750
你居然下毒害他
You goddamn poisoned him.

771
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,760
警卫  把他弄走
Guards, get him out of here.

772
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,060
我什么也没做
I didn't do shit.

773
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,030
你怎么不过来站在我面前说
Why don't you come over here and say that to my face?

774
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,480
-你以为我不敢吗  -真该死
- You think I won't? - God damn it.

775
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,380
我说了把他带回牢房
I said get him back to his cell!

776
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,030
这可不包括在我们说好的事情里
This wasn't part of the deal.

777
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,720
我们说好让你来见他的同屋狱友
We talked about you seeing his roommate,

778
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,070
而不是去招惹弗兰克・加洛
not rushing Frank Gallo.

779
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,000
我的人还躺在医疗室昏迷不醒
Yeah,  my guy's lying unconscious in the infirmary.

780
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,340
去告我啊
So sue me.

781
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,810
你怎么知道加洛会上钩
How did you know Gallo would take the bait?

782
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:23,570
因为他是畜生  畜生总是会咬钩上当的
Because he's an animal, and animals always take the bait.

783
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,800
我真欣赏你能看清事情走向
I'll give you credit for knowing how it would go down.

784
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,800
我不需要称赞
I don't need credit.

785
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,450
我需要知道迈克・罗斯在哪
I need to know where Mike Ross is.

786
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,180
在我被告知带他去的地方
Where I was instructed to put him.

787
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,740
我得跟你说  斯佩克特先生
Let me tell you something, Mr. Specter,

788
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,600
我不了解你
I don't know you.

789
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,080
所以以防你想耍别的花招
So in case you're thinking of trying anything,

790
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,520
我们在那个孩子的腿上安了监测器
that kid has a monitor on his leg,

791
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,570
如果监测器失联哪怕一秒钟
and if it goes dark for even one second,

792
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,000
我保证到时你会和他一起坐牢
I'm gonna make sure that you end up in a cell here with him.

793
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,600
不会出问题的
It's not gonna go dark,

794
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,660
他会按我之前说的时间回来的
and he'll be back here when I said he would.

795
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,040
那之后  我也可以保证
Then after that, I'm gonna make sure

796
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,080
他会永远地离开这里
he gets out of here. For good.

797
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,750
你感觉怎么样
How you feeling?

798
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,010
什么情况
What's going on?

799
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,480
我在哪
Where am I?

800
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,190
你在我车里
You're in the back of my car.

801
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,470
你被下药了
You were drugged.

802
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,320
加洛干的
By Gallo.

803
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,360
我干的
By me.

804
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,250
什么
What?

805
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,150
卡荷尔让典狱长和狱医
Cahill got the warden and the prison doctor

806
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,710
往你食物里加了些东西
to put something in your food.

807
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,320
整件事只有他们知道
They're the only ones who know what's going on.

808
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,740
你到底在说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

809
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,340
我们需要你改变心意  去接受这个交易
We needed to change your mind about taking this deal,

810
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,110
而只要你在里面  我们就做不到
and we couldn't do it as long as you're in there.

811
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,030
我的天哪
Jesus Christ.

812
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,390
那你就给我下药
So you drugged me?

813
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,440
要让你不在牢里  我们就要一个好理由
We needed a cover for why you're not in your cell,

814
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,730
这是唯一可行的办法了
and this was the only way to do it.

815
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,780
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

816
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,100
你这是带我越狱啊
You broke me out of prison?

817
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,500
我可没有带你越任何地方
I didn't break you out of anywhere.

818
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,730
这是卡荷尔批准的
Cahill sanctioned it.

819
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,790
要说有人疯了  那也是你
And if anyone's insane, it's you, 'cause you're the one

820
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,830
因为是你拒绝了出狱的机会
turning down a chance to get out of that place.

821
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,930
但我们现在没时间讨论那件事
But we don't have time to talk about that right now.

822
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,180
卡荷尔在等我们
Cahill's waiting for us.

823
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,700
你把我弄出来就是为了带我去见卡荷尔
You got me out to see Cahill?

824
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,670
我只是说他在等我们
I said he's waiting.

825
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,440
我又没说我要带你去他那
I didn't say that's where I'm taking you.

826
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,210
那你到底要带我去哪
Then where the hell are you taking me?

827
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,550
你认为我和瑞秋一起待几个小时
You think me spending a couple of hours with Rachel

828
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,740
就能改变心意
is gonna change my mind?

829
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,050
如果这都不行  那你肯定有毛病
If it doesn't, there's something wrong with you.

830
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,030
那么  你是要对我大吼大叫
So, you gonna yell at me?

831
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,890
还是抓住这唯一的机会
Or you gonna take the only chance you're gonna get

832
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,190
能够在接下来的两年里
to be alone with the woman you love

833
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,750
和你爱的女人待在一起
for the next two years?

834
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,530
拜托告诉我你没有跟瑞秋提过
Please tell me that you did not tell her

835
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,930
卡荷尔的提议
about Cahill's offer.

836
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,400
我倒是想啊
I wanted to.

837
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,540
但是你得谢谢唐娜  是她拦住了我
But you have Donna to thank for the fact that I didn't.

838
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,630
我该怎么跟瑞秋解释我出现在这里
What am I supposed to tell Rachel about why I'm here?

839
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,270
如果是我  我就告诉她真相
If it were me, I'd tell her the truth.

840
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,700
现在  既然你不想那么做
Now, since you don't want to do that,

841
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,220
你真幸运我还想到了别的说辞
you're lucky I came up with something else.

842
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,890
等涨到三十就卖掉
Wait till it hits 30 and then sell.

843
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,510
看这谁来了
Look who it is.

844
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,160
你准备改变主意接受我的提议了吗
You change your mind about my offer?

845
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,880
我现在还不会考虑
I'm not there just yet.

846
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,620
但我确实是来道歉的
But I did come to apologize.

847
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,710
我并不是想表现的那么好斗
I didn't mean to be so combative before.

848
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,050
你是个自尊心强的女人  我懂  都过去了
You're a proud woman. I understand. Bygones.

849
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,980
你把这里经营的很出色
You know, your operation here is kind of impressive.

850
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,560
介意我看一下吗
Mind if I look at one?

851
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,470
你想看什么就看什么
You can take a look at anything of mine you want.

852
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,160
那一行是什么意思
Now, what does that line right there mean?

853
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,940
怎么搞的  那是我的纽宝客投资公司股价
What the hell, that's my Neubacher Capital position.

854
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,420
好像跌的很快
It seems to be falling very quickly.

855
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,600
是好事吗
Is that a good thing?

856
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:51,900
是你干的
You did this.

857
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,270
我不知道你在说什么
I'm not sure what you mean.

858
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,220
我所做的只是下午
All I did this afternoon

859
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,160
给我在雅格森・科尔尼工作的朋友打了个电话
was call my friend at Jacobson Kearney

860
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,560
让他们发布一个新闻稿
and have them issue a press release

861
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,610
披露他们客户的公司合并谈判
about their client's merger negotiations.

862
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,270
我又怎么会知道这会
I mean, how was I supposed to know that it would make

863
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,860
让你的纽宝客投资公司股价暴跌
your Neubacher position fall through the floor?

864
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,620
你利用了我昨天给你的信息
You used the information I gave you yesterday

865
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,210
那是关于我控股股份的  所以你知道
about my holdings, that's how.

866
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,410
那属于内部消息  我能证实
That's inside information, and I can prove it.

867
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,350
不会的  本来是可以的
No, it could have been,

868
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,180
可惜你的律师在要求截止日十天前
if your attorney hadn't filed your position with the SEC

869
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,840
就把你的持仓在证监会备了案
ten days earlier than he had to.

870
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,460
我会记住这件事的
I'm not gonna forget this.

871
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,340
很好  因为我经营的时间
Good, because my operation's been around

872
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,640
比你经营的时间长的多
a hell of a lot longer than yours,

873
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,680
我们可以成为朋友  当然也可能成为敌人
and we can be friends or we can be enemies.

874
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,220
但如果你再给我找麻烦
But you mess with me again

875
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,390
我就不只是把你踢出这里
and I'll not only kick you out of these offices,

876
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,280
我会整死你
I'll put you in the ground.

877
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,240
瑞秋
Rachel.

878
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,450
你怎么来了
How?

879
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,030
哈维
Harvey.

880
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,780
我不懂
I don't understand.

881
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,740
我知道你知道弗兰克・加洛的事
I know you know about Frank Gallo.

882
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,070
但你不知道的是
But what you don't know

883
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,730
他们关了我三十六小时单独监禁
is that they put me in solitary confinement for 36 hours.

884
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,910
-天呐  -没事的
- Oh my God. - It's okay.

885
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:06,890
我很安全
I was safe.

886
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,070
后来哈维让他们看了监控
Then Harvey made them watch the video,

887
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,180
录像表明我只是正当防卫
which showed that I was only defending myself.

888
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,880
他们也很高兴能以六个小时时间
Turns out they were more than happy to trade

889
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,600
和一个追踪器的代价避免一场诉讼
six hours and an ankle bracelet to avoid a lawsuit.

890
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,120
我们只有六小时
We only have six hours?

891
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,060
是的  我一秒钟也不想浪费
Yeah, and I don't want to waste any of it.

892
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,180
利特先生  你这是
Mr. Litt, what are you--

893
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,890
请别这么见外  叫我路易吧
Please, call me Louis.

894
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,030
有什么事情吗  路易
What can I do for you, Louis?

895
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,530
塔拉  恐怕我有坏消息告诉你
Tara, I'm afraid I have some bad news.

896
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,520
我们最终还是不能
We're not gonna be moving forward

897
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,970
继续改建项目了
with the renovations after all.

898
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,540
真遗憾
I'm sorry to hear that.

899
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,150
不  这和你没关系
No, it has nothing to do with you.

900
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,400
当然  我会个人出资
And of course I will pay you out of my own pocket

901
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,730
为你所做的一切工作付钱
for any of the work you've already done.

902
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,740
没有这个必要
That won't be necessary.

903
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,350
请别客气  塔拉  我一定得付
Please, Tara, I insist.

904
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,190
既然如此  那我不如也给你看看
In that case, I might as well at least

905
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,520
我的初步设计吧
show you what I had in mind.

906
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,920
你能看出  这只是初步草图
As you can see, these are just rough drawings.

907
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,560
我觉得很好了
Not to me.

908
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,930
这是一个优雅的S形弯曲的磨砂玻璃
Here's the frosted glass wall curving in an elegant "S"

909
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,550
用以隔开空间
that separates the space.

910
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,150
好美
It's beautiful.

911
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,920
这还不是最棒的
That's not even the best part.

912
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,170
因为我知道新的大办公室对你多重要
Because I know how important the new bullpen is to you,

913
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,430
所以我以费城的金美儿中心为原型
I modeled it after the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia,

914
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,080
整个空间周围是
and I enclosed the entire space--

915
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,150
桃花心木
In mahogany.

916
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,540
如果能实现肯定非常漂亮
It would have been exquisite.

917
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,040
但有些事注定无缘
But some things weren't meant to be.

918
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:47,650
是啊
Yeah.

919
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,310
你愿意整修我在汉普顿的
How would you feel about renovating my summer house

920
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,210
避暑别墅吗
in the Hamptons?

921
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,200
我很感激
I appreciate the thought,

922
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,940
路易  但我不接受私宅的工作
Louis, but I don't do residential work.

923
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,710
不是私宅  那是我的家庭办公室
It's not residential. I use it as a home office.

924
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,740
但那肯定很小吧
But it would be so small.

925
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,840
不  我希望把整栋房子
No, I want the entire house to be

926
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,120
做成公司的分部
a satellite division of the firm.

927
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,290
你确定吗
Are you sure?

928
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,580
我这辈子从来没有这么确定过
I've never been as sure of anything in my entire life.

929
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,440
那我很期待与你合作  路易
Then I look forward to working with you, Louis.

930
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,970
肖恩  有什么事吗
Sean, what can I do for you?

931
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,510
-他们人呢  -什么
- Where the hell are they? - What?

932
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,410
我在我的办公室
I've been sitting in my office

933
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,730
等了他们两小时了
for two hours waiting for them.

934
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,200
他们在哪
Where the hell are they?

935
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,470
我不知道  也许是堵车了
I don't know. Maybe they're caught in traffic.

936
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,930
听着  我可以联系监狱
Listen to me, I can contact the prison

937
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,530
直接找出他们的位置
and find out exactly where they are.

938
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,490
但如果那样做  会掀起一场
But I do that, it starts a tornado of shit

939
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,800
以你的上司为中心的风暴
with your boss in the eye of the storm.

940
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,960
所以你最好马上告诉我
So you're gonna tell me right now

941
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,450
他们到底要干什么
what the hell they're up to.

942
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,420
他在迈克的公寓外面等他呢
He's waiting for Mike outside of his apartment.

943
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,310
等他做什么
Waiting for him to do what?

944
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,760
-他和瑞秋在一起  -你逗我呢吧
- He's with Rachel. - You got to be kidding me.

945
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,930
我找了那么多关系不是为了让迈克・罗斯
I didn't pull in every favor I have so Mike Ross

946
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,180
享受什么夫妻探访的
could have some conjugal visit.

947
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,580
对  你找了那么多关系
No, you pulled in every favor you had

948
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,030
是为了让哈维说服迈克去做你想做的事
so that Harvey could convince Mike to do what you wanted

949
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,590
这就能达到这个目的
and this is gonna make that happen.

950
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,720
就是给他找个女人吗
By getting him laid?

951
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,370
是提醒他如果不接受你的条件
By reminding him of what he's missing out on

952
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,630
他会错过什么
if he doesn't take your deal.

953
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,800
计划不是这样的
That wasn't the plan.

954
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,150
你要去哪
Where are you going?

955
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,220
我要去找他
I'm gonna go down there and do

956
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,170
按我们的原计划来
what we said we were gonna do.

957
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,540
我要给迈克讲因为那个混蛋
I'm gonna show Mike the innocent people

958
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,330
失去了一切的无辜的人的事
that lost everything because of that bastard.

959
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,180
肖恩  拜托  如果你那么做
Sean, please, if you do that,

960
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,730
瑞秋就会知道一切了
Rachel will find out about everything

961
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,360
-我们不能让她知道  -为什么
- and that can't happen. - Why not?

962
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,320
因为迈克已经放弃她选择了一次监狱
Because Mike chose prison over her once,

963
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,920
要是他再这样做一次  她不会原谅他的
and if he does it again, she'll never forgive him.

964
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,400
那是迈克的事  不是我的
Mike's problem. Not mine.

965
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,360
不是你的  但是哈维的
No, that's Harvey's problem.

966
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,400
他答应了迈克不会告诉她
He promised Mike he wouldn't tell her,

967
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,840
哈维是很重承诺的
and Harvey's a man of his word.

968
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,600
他要是重承诺  现在人就应该在这里
If he were a man of his word, he would be here right now.

969
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,460
那你要干什么
So what are you gonna do?

970
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,600
我要去做本来就应该
I'm gonna do what should've been done

971
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,340
做的事
in the first place.

972
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,740
告诉迈克的未婚妻
I'm gonna tell Mike's fiancée

973
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,960
他本有机会出来
that he has a chance to get out

974
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,310
但他自己不愿意
but he doesn't want to take it.

975
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,590
打算告诉我这都是什么情况吗
You want to tell me what that was all about?

976
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,090
哈维和卡荷尔把迈克弄出了监狱
Harvey and Cahill got Mike out of prison

977
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,550
为了说服他接受交易
to convince him to take the deal,

978
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,170
哈维带迈克去了瑞秋家  没去见肖恩
and Harvey brought Mike to Rachel instead of to Sean.

979
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,160
他竟然带迈克越了狱
He broke Mike out of prison?

980
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,210
他疯了吗
Is he crazy?

981
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,880
我刚开始得知也觉得疯狂
It sounded crazy to me at first too,

982
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,320
但是哈维一直困在害迈克进监狱的愧疚里
but Harvey's living with the guilt of putting Mike in there

983
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,810
卡荷尔又愿意帮忙  你能怪他吗
and Cahill was willing to do it, so can you blame him?

984
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,080
不能
No. I can't.

985
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,890
但我要知道事情的结果
But I want to know how this whole thing shakes out.

986
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,930
我今晚就要知道
And I want to know tonight.

987
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,770
现在几点
What time is it?

988
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,890
我们还有时间
We still have time.

989
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,080
天呐
My God.

990
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,430
我睡着了
I fell asleep.

991
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,780
是的
You did.

992
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,770
怎么不叫醒我
Why didn't you wake me?

993
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,900
因为你看起来好平和
Because you looked so peaceful.

994
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,640
瑞秋  我不希望我们浪费...
Rachel, I don't want us to waste--

995
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,220
我们什么也没有浪费
We're not wasting anything.

996
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,530
迈克  我不知道你在里面睡得怎么样
Mike, I don't know how well you sleep in there,

997
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,740
所以能让你睡一觉...
so to be able to give you this...

998
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,740
谢谢你
Thank you.

999
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,870
我能给你做点什么吃的
Can I cook you something?

1000
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,020
你想吃什么我都给你做
I'll make you anything you want.

1001
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,750
不  我只想跟你一起躺着  看着对方
No, I just want us to lie here and stare at each other.

1002
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,440
什么也不说
Not saying anything.

1003
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,070
天呐
God.

1004
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,990
你好美
You're so beautiful.

1005
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,390
我以为你想要我们保持安静呢
I thought you wanted us to be quiet.

1006
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,920
我忍不住嘛
Couldn't help it.

1007
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,110
你总是跟我说我有多好看
You know, you always tell me how beautiful I am.

1008
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,910
我却从没机会告诉你在我眼里
You never give me a chance to tell you how handsome

1009
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,770
你有多帅
I think you are.

1010
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,510
我以为你爱的是我的思想
I thought you loved me for my mind.

1011
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,230
没错
I do.

1012
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,790
但那不代表
But that doesn't mean

1013
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,990
我不能同时认为你长得帅
that I don't also think you're handsome.

1014
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,480
迈克  怎么了
Mike, what's going on?

1015
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,800
我得跟你说件事
There's something I need to tell you.

1016
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,830
跟你能在这里的真实原因有关吗
Does it have something to do with why you're really here?

1017
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,640
因为我不相信你之前说的话
Because I didn't believe what you told me earlier.

1018
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,820
那你怎么什么都没说
Why didn't you say something?

1019
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:53,050
因为你在这儿了  我什么都不在乎了
Because you're here, so I didn't care.

1020
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,030
怎么了
What's that?

1021
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,290
我会买回南森・巴恩斯公司的股票
I'm unwinding my position with Nathan Burns' company.

1022
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,140
我很感激
I appreciate that.

1023
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,950
但我不需要把文件都带回家
But I don't need to take home the paper trail.

1024
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,120
这不是文件
It's not a paper trail.

1025
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,010
是份聘书
It's an engagement letter.

1026
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,720
我发现我的律师在必要时间之前
Turns out my attorney was filing my positions

1027
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,590
就上报了我的持仓
before he had to,

1028
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,660
我就把他开了
so I let him go.

1029
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,530
你想让我签你做客户
You want me to take you as a client.

1030
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,820
你愿意的话
If you'll have me.

1031
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,790
就一个条件
On one condition.

1032
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,810
我听说你在拿路易・利特取乐
I hear you've been having fun with Louis Litt.

1033
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,130
到此为止
But it stops now.

1034
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,150
成交
Done.

1035
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,250
我就该知道一个雇了那种骗子的人
I should have known the guy who hired a fraud like that

1036
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,460
是会耍这种花招的
would pull a stunt like this.

1037
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,260
这花招可以帮你拿到你想要的
This stunt is gonna get youexactly what you want.

1038
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:51,880
不  哈维
No, Harvey.

1039
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,920
我要去把事实告诉那小子的未婚妻
I'm gonna get what I want

1040
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,420
让她帮我做事
by telling that kid's fiancée the truth

1041
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,940
来拿到我想要的
and letting her do the work for me.

1042
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,950
听我说  肖恩
Listen to me, Sean.

1043
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,800
她不知道
She doesn't know

1044
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,590
是因为他不想让她知道
because he doesn't want her to know.

1045
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,900
我不管他想要什么
I don't give a shit what he wants.

1046
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,330
那你相信我  这是唯一让你
Then trust me, this is the only way

1047
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,370
如愿以偿的办法
to get what you want.

1048
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,360
信你  你当我的面骗我
Trust you? You lied to my face.

1049
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,230
我做了判断
I made a judgment call.

1050
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,850
那你看着我的眼睛
Then look me in the eye

1051
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,040
告诉我你做这个判断
and tell me you didn't make that call

1052
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,670
是在你要求我把他弄出来之后
before you asked me to get him out.

1053
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,410
我就知道
I knew it.

1054
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,390
你一直都想把他带到这儿来
The whole time you were always gonna bring him here.

1055
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,900
因为这是完成任务的办法
Because this is the way to get it done.

1056
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,510
那你为什么一开始不告诉我
Then why didn't you tell me that in the first place?

1057
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,410
因为那结果会变成
Because it would have ended up

1058
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,180
你想要利用瑞秋
with you wanting to use Rachel.

1059
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,070
无论如何结果都是这样了  现在给我让开
It ended there anyway. Now get the hell out of my way.

1060
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,460
别逼我阻止你  肖恩
Don't make me stop you, Sean.

1061
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,510
你是在威胁一名联邦检察官吗  哈维
Are you threatening a federal prosecutor, Harvey?

1062
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,670
没错  我是在威胁你
You're goddamn right I am.

1063
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,200
你这次最好比上次
Well, you better think about this move

1064
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,960
想得更清楚点
 more than you thought about the last one.

1065
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,500
因为这次绝对不会让你有好果子吃
'Cause it's not gonnaend well for you.

1066
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,730
在我看来
Far as I'm concerned,

1067
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,950
这是一回事
it's the same move.

1068
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,850
我做了保证  就要守住它
I made a promise and I'm not gonna break it.

1069
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:36,860
哈维
Harvey!

1070
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,640
无论你们在吵什么  都可以停了
Whatever you're fighting about, you can stop.

1071
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,750
我把一切都告诉瑞秋了
I told Rachel everything.

1072
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,750
我接受协议
I'm taking the deal.

1073
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,700
那我们就上车走吧
Then let's get in the car and get moving.

1074
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:55,820
{\an9}*再吻我一次*[Death Valley by My Jerusalem]
*Oh kiss me one more time*

1075
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,160
{\an9}*再吻我一次*
*Oh kiss me one more time*

1076
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,700
{\an9}*在太阳下山前*
*Before the sun goes down*

1077
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,400
{\an9}*在太阳下山前*
*Before the sun goes down*

1078
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,570
{\an9}*所有夜行的动物*
*And all the creatures of the night*

1079
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,800
{\an9}*所有夜行的动物*
*And all the creatures of the night*

1080
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,060
{\an9}*爬过这座城市*
*Crawling over this town*

1081
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,860
{\an9}*爬过这座城市*
*Crawling over this town*

1082
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,460
{\an9}*我在城中迷失*
*I'm lost in the city*

1083
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,140
{\an9}*这天使之城*
*The city of angels*

1084
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,330
{\an9}*落入谷底*
*Down in the valley*
