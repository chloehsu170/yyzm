00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,460
{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,020
你接了个意外事故的案子
You took a case on contingency

16
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,310
原告还都是穷人
where every plaintiff is dirt poor.

17
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:11,910
撤销
Dump it.

18
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,960
我叔叔基思也是受害者之一
One of the victims was my uncle Keith.

19
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,670
这些人需要你的帮助
Please, these people need your help.

20
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,770
他们需要你这样的人为他们争取
They need someone like you to fight for them,

21
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,330
而我做不到
and I can't do it.

22
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,820
那你觉得我们一起做如何
Then what do you say we do it together?

23
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,510
我想提议对当前的薪酬计算方法
I'd like to propose a change to

24
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,170
进行调整
the current compensation formula.

25
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,520
如果我们投票的话
How many partners do you have in your pocket

26
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,950
你能调动多少合伙人支持
if we put your proposal to a vote?

27
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,350
45%
I can get 45%.

28
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,530
我能帮你通过投票
I'm gonna get you the difference.

29
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,270
这是哈维最近三个案子的收益表
This is Harvey's last three income statements,

30
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,890
我发现它们被放在复印机里
and I found them sitting in the copy machine.

31
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,210
是你主动为我工作的
You came to work for me,

32
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,520
你该作出决定了
so now it's time for you to decide.

33
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,550
你到底要不要站在我这边
Are you with me or not?

34
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,460
我刚刚要求明天就我的提议进行投票
I just called for a vote tomorrow,

35
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,070
希望你有存钱的习惯
and I hope you've been saving your money,

36
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,450
因为你那钱多事少的工作马上就要没了
because your gravy train's about to leave the station.

37
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,950
你好
Oh, hello.

38
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,670
-我只是  -在工作
- I was just... - Working.

39
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,400
我看到了  但现在刚早晨七点半
I see that, but it's 7:30 in the morning.

40
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,980
你来这么早干什么
What are you doing here so early?

41
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,850
我想在混乱开始之前到公司
I like to get in before the chaos starts.

42
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,630
跟你说实话吧  我以为
Tell you the truth, I was under the impression

43
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,700
你还要很久才会来
that you wouldn't get in till much later.

44
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,010
我想提前开始我的一天
I wanted to get a jump on the day.

45
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,680
那你也许该动手解决这项工作
Then maybe you should get a jump on this.

46
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,160
我为什么要支付路易的干洗账单
Why am I paying Louis's laundry bill?

47
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,230
因为如果你支付了
Because if you pay it,

48
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,960
他就不会知道我们给他所有的衬衫上了三倍浆
he won't know that we triple-starched all of his shirts.

49
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,130
-我们  -是的  我们
- We? - Yes, we.

50
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,190
他盯着我们不放  我们也不放过他
He came after us. We're coming after him.

51
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,210
你觉得我不会支持你吗
Did you think I wouldn't have your back?

52
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,330
你想听真话吗
You want the truth?

53
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,740
我以为你看了我挣多少钱以后
I thought you'd be asking for a raise

54
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,030
想要加薪呢
after seeing how much I make.

55
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,660
我没看你挣多少钱
I didn't look at how much you make.

56
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,650
而且我认为
And as far as I'm concerned,

57
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,410
看到的人都应该被开除
anyone who did should be fired.

58
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,200
你很不错  格蕾琴
You're all right, Gretchen.

59
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,860
但暂时不要再
But for the time being,

60
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,540
捉弄路易了
don't play any more jokes on Louis.

61
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,570
我能问问为什么吗
Mind if I ask why?

62
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,070
因为我要捉弄人
Because I only play jokes on people

63
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,710
是为了表达好感
to express my affection for them,

64
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,900
可现在我对路易・利特一点好感都没有
and right now I have no affection for Louis Litt.

65
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,450
看来我来的正是时候
Looks like I got here just in time.

66
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,800
为什么
And why is that?

67
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,970
因为我想让你做一些
Because I'm going to ask you to do something

68
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,180
你不愿意做的事
you're not going to want to do,

69
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,710
但不同的是  这次你会照做
only this time you're going to do it.

70
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,340
我上次怎么做的
What didn't I do last time?

71
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,230
我让你去和路易道歉
I told you to apologize to Louis.

72
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,200
我去了  就在他和杰克・索罗夫握手联盟
And I did, right before he held hands with Jack Soloff

73
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,190
在全公司面前削减我的收入之前
and cut my earnings in front of the entire firm.

74
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,100
但如果你一开始对杰克
And if you hadn't have been such a dick to Jack

75
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,000
友善一点的话
in the first place,

76
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,500
路易就无人可找了
Louis would have had nowhere to go.

77
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,600
这与路易无关是吧
This isn't about Louis, is it?

78
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,410
无关
No, it isn't.

79
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,810
我想你和杰克和解
I want you to bury the hatchet with Jack.

80
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,170
你是说你想我去拍他马屁
You mean you want me to kiss his ass.

81
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,520
我是说我想你找个办法
I mean I want you to figure out a way

82
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,930
去跟一个影响力逐渐上升的合伙人和平相处
to make peace with a partner whose influence is on the rise.

83
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,140
那就是拍他马屁啊
That's kissing his ass.

84
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,380
如果你是这么认为的
Well, if that's how you want to look at it,

85
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,180
那就忍着吧  因为他是个威胁
then pucker up, because that man is a threat,

86
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,420
而且他与路易结盟了
and he's aligned with Louis,

87
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,750
我可没心情进行权力斗争
and I am in no mood for a power struggle.

88
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,010
我今早都没听见你出门
I didn't hear you leave today.

89
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,810
因为我早上五点就走了
That's because I left at 5:00 in the morning,

90
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,490
想要早点着手处理这个案子
trying to get an early start on this case.

91
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,160
关于这件事
About that...

92
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,920
我昨晚不想发表意见
I didn't want to say anything last night

93
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,250
因为你看起来太兴奋了
because you were so excited--

94
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,440
但我和你父亲共事让你很担忧
But you're worried about me working with your father.

95
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,340
是的
Yes.

96
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,160
迈克  你们是我人生中最重要的两个男人
Mike, you're the two most important men in my life.

97
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,960
但你俩都是不愿退让的性格
Neither of you back down from a fight,

98
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,020
我只是
and I'm just--

99
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,070
我怕你们最终会憎恨对方
I'm afraid you're gonna end up hating each other.

100
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,620
瑞秋  你恨你的父亲吗
Rachel, do you hate your father?

101
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,710
当然不了  我爱我爸爸
Of course not. I love my dad.

102
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,220
那你不是也时时和他有冲突吗
And don't you have conflicts with him all the time?

103
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,310
是的  但这不一样
Yes, I do, but it's different.

104
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,150
他是我的家人
He's my family.

105
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,880
是啊  他也要成为我的家人了
Yeah, he's gonna be my family too.

106
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,200
如果我足够幸运的话  将会在以后的许多年
And if I'm lucky, I'm gonna fight with him

107
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,920
因为很多事情和他争斗
about a lot of things over the years.

108
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,640
所以为什么不以一次我们合作的斗争
So why not start with a fight

109
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,980
作为开始呢
where we're both on the same side?

110
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,790
好吧  我信任你
Okay, I trust you.

111
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,820
那就好
Good.

112
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,720
杰西卡  你有时间吗
Jessica, you have a minute?

113
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,220
如果你是来告诉我为何
I do if you're here to tell me

114
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,070
罗伯特・赞恩会在大堂里
why Robert Zane is sitting in the lobby

115
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,430
等着见你  那我就有
with an appointment to see you.

116
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,790
因为我很确定他是不会
'Cause I'm pretty sure he's not taking time

117
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,890
利用忙碌的早上讨论装饰品的
out of his busy morning to talk about centerpieces.

118
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,720
他是不会
No, he's not.

119
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,000
他是来共同代理凯尔顿案的
He is here to co-counsel the Kelton case.

120
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,210
你是说我明确让你撤销的那个案子吗
You mean the case I explicitly told you to drop?

121
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,050
我是说那个你认为会造成巨额的
I mean the case that you said would cost a fortune to fund

122
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,020
你并不想承担的开销的案子
and you didn't wanna lay out that kind of money for.

123
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,100
我不想承担是因为这个案子会输
I didn't want to lay it out because this case is a loser.

124
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,400
而我想告诉你不会输
And I'm telling you it's not.

125
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,880
而且就算会输  我也将损失消除了
And even if it is, I just took away our downside.

126
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,520
通过背着我去找我们最大的竞争对手吗
By going behind my back to our biggest competitor.

127
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,290
你是在说你害怕罗伯特・赞恩吗
Are you telling me that you're scared of Robert Zane?

128
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,690
我要不怕是我傻
I'd be a fool if I wasn't.

129
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,590
你要不怕是你傻
And you're a fool if you're not.

130
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,860
我们让那个人走进我们地盘
We let that man into our house,

131
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,640
就只有天知道他会干出什么事了
there's no telling what he'll do.

132
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,450
你知道吗  杰西卡
You know what, Jessica?

133
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,800
如果哈维这么做了  你会很生气
If Harvey had done this, you'd be pissed,

134
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,910
但你最终会允许他那样做
but you'd let him do it anyway.

135
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,530
你也许和他一样拽
And you may be as cocky as him,

136
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,780
但你并不是哈维
but you are not Harvey.

137
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,730
你说对了  对不起
No, you're right. I'm sorry.

138
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,770
我想我应该直接去告诉罗伯特
I guess I'll just go tell Robert

139
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,680
我们无法合作这个案子了
that we won't be working together on this after all.

140
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,570
你很清楚如果你现在这么跟他说
You know damn well if we tell him that now,

141
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,790
会让我看起来很软弱
I look weak.

142
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,350
那也许我确实和哈维一样厉害
So maybe I am as good as Harvey.

143
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,500
有时那并不是一件好事
Well, sometimes that's not a good thing.

144
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,420
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

145
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,030
去找回一些该死的强势
To get some goddamn strength back.

146
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,590
那你就这么办吧
Then go ahead and do it.

147
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,350
我不只会把你关进小黑屋
I won't just take you to the woodshed.

148
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,070
我会留你在那  等死
I'll leave you there, dead.

149
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,400
看来你在我的办公室
Well, looks like you're making yourself comfortable

150
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,550
还挺舒服
in my offices.

151
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,840
说到椅子的舒适性
About as comfortable as possible in these chairs.

152
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,460
你听说过腰部支持这种功能吗
You ever hear of lumbar support?

153
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,400
我懂了  你喜欢简单实用的
I get it. You like stodgy and functional.

154
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,830
但这些毕竟是我的椅子
But these are my chairs,

155
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,540
就像这是我的案子
just like this is my case.

156
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,790
你到这里来做什么  杰西卡
What exactly are you doing here, Jessica?

157
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,870
我来告诉你这案子的收益一半归我们
I'm here to tell you we're taking half the contingency.

158
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,020
那我也回个信  我给你们1/3
And I'm here to respond. I'm giving you 1/3.

159
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,170
这案子是我们给你的
We brought this case to you.

160
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,390
因为你们觉得这是个烫手的山芋
After you found it in a box crying for its mama.

161
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,670
而且  费用全部由我负担
Plus, I'm footing the bill,

162
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,710
所以收益也没什么好讨论的
which means this fee discussion is over.

163
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,010
或许收益可以就讨论到这儿
Well, this fee discussion may be over,

164
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,330
但关于权力的讨论才刚开始
but the power discussion is just getting started.

165
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,080
你根本不在乎钱的事吧
You don't give a shit about the money, do you?

166
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,550
在这个案子上
On this particular case,

167
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,810
我在意的只是不让你为所欲为
all I give a shit about is keeping you in check.

168
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,400
也就是说  在整个处理案件的期间
Which means, for the duration of this matter,

169
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,680
你得把迈克・罗斯当作合伙人看待
you will be treating Mike Ross like a partner.

170
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,190
你这是开玩笑吧
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

171
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,450
那小子胡子都没长全呢
That boy barely shaves.

172
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,250
就算他还包着尿布我也不管
I don't care if he's still in diapers.

173
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,360
他代表着我的律所
He's representing my firm,

174
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,900
也就代表着我
which means he's representing me.

175
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,100
你看到他  就像看到我一样
You look at him, you see me.

176
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,030
你这个要求可不小
You're asking for a hell of a lot.

177
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,450
那你就把脚从我桌上拿开
Then take your wingtips off my table

178
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,570
离开这间办公室
and walk 'em out the door,

179
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,770
因为这是我的案子
because this is my case

180
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,090
你要么按我说的做  要么就滚蛋
and you either do it my way or you don't do it at all.

181
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,340
我爱死你了
I love you.

182
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,940
路易  今天不是我生日
Louis, it's not my birthday.

183
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,140
我知道  但我知道你很不满意
I know, but I know that you weren't happy

184
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,650
哈维薪酬事件时
with the position I put you in

185
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,320
我把你推入的境地
regarding Harvey's compensation,

186
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,070
所以我想来确认我们之间没什么问题
so I just wanted to make sure that you and I were okay.

187
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,480
说实话  你想知道我真实想法吗
Actually, you wanna know the truth?

188
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,540
此时此刻  我是很不开心
Right at this second, I'm not okay.

189
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,330
那请告诉我
Then please tell me,

190
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,620
我要怎么做才能让你开心
what can I do to make it okay?

191
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,110
你以后再也不要让我
You can start by never putting me

192
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,490
身处那种境地了
in a position like that again.

193
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,440
我不会了
I won't.

194
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,700
杰克  我得和你谈谈
Jack, I need to talk to you.

195
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,860
好  路易  有什么可以帮到你
Sure, Louis, what can I do for you?

196
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,270
你可以认为我已经退出你和哈维的战争了
Well, you can consider me out of your war with Harvey.

197
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,700
什么意思
What are you talking about?

198
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,960
意思是我不喜欢我之前的行为
I'm saying that I don't like what I did,

199
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,860
从现在开始  我不想掺和这件事了
and from now on, I don't want anything to do with it.

200
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,200
我无所谓  路易
Fine by me, Louis.

201
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,290
在我看来  我赢定哈维了
As far as I'm concerned, I won my war with Harvey.

202
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,200
这是你的办公室吗
This is your office?

203
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,620
为什么是这种语气
Why do you say it like that?

204
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,570
-什么语气  -一脸嫌弃
- Like what? - With disgust.

205
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,430
因为哈维的办公室里都是
'Cause Harvey's got autographed basketballs

206
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,210
明星签名的篮球和古董唱片
and vintage records,

207
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,980
而你只有一张男人鞋的照片
and you've got a photograph of a guy's shoes.

208
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,470
你最好小心
Well, you better be careful

209
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,230
否则大脚中士胡卡
or Sergeant Hulka with the big toe

210
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,890
会用尽全力踹你屁股
is gonna see how far he can stick it up your ass.

211
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,830
你在说什么鬼
What the hell are you talking about?

212
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,500
《杂牌军东征》
Stripes.

213
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,590
我刚引用了里面的对白
I'm just quoting Stripes.

214
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,510
那是一部电影
It's a movie.

215
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,990
哈维和我常常这样对话
Harvey and I do this all the time.

216
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,520
我不懂你和他之前玩的儿童游戏
Look, I don't know what kind of teenage nonsense

217
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,340
我也不爱玩
you got going on with him, but I don't do that shit.

218
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,670
好吧
Okay.

219
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,430
我打算去趟疗养院
I'm going to visit the facility.

220
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,920
十分钟后楼下大堂见
Meet you down in the lobby in ten.

221
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,390
这么说你和杰西卡谈得还顺利
I take it that means that things went well with Jessica?

222
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,730
对  她罢手了  而我要做的只是
Yep, she signed off, and all I had to do was

223
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,490
答应把你当作成熟平等的合伙人对待
agree to treat you as a full and equal partner.

224
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,190
那肯定对你打击不小
Whoa, that must have hurt.

225
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,810
才不是  我不是真的答应她
Eh, it didn't hurt a bit, 'cause I didn't mean it with her,

226
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,140
我也不会真的那么对你
and I'm not gonna do it with you.

227
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,540
十分钟后见
See you in 10.

228
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,240
最好十五分钟
Better make that 15.

229
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,620
听说你在找我
Heard you're looking for me.

230
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,820
对  因为我想把这个给你
I was, because I wanted to give you this.

231
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,230
这是什么
What's that?

232
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,000
去韦斯特切斯特乡村俱乐部的路线
Directions to Westchester Country Club.

233
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,650
为什么要给我这个
Why are you giving them to me?

234
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,950
因为我不希望你错过了11:30
Because I don't want you to be late to your 11:30 tee time

235
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,140
{\an8}[前美国职业篮球运动员  NBA历史上著名的大前锋之一]

236
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,140
和查尔斯・巴克利的那场球
with Charles Barkley.

237
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,330
我要和查尔斯・巴克利打高尔夫
I'm playing golf with Charles Barkley?

238
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,290
如果你按时到的话  是的
If you get there on time, you are.

239
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,690
如果你迟到了  他会乱挥大杆
If not and he starts whacking at shit with his big club,

240
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,570
搞不好还会杀人呢
he might kill someone.

241
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,680
那你就错过了好戏
You'll miss the whole thing.

242
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,310
你以为我不知道你的小算盘吗
You think I don't know what you're doing?

243
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,100
你在巴结我  因为突然间
You're sucking up to me 'cause all of a sudden

244
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,970
你意识到我是个不可小觑的人物
you realized I'm someone to be reckoned with.

245
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,150
你说的没错
That is what I'm doing.

246
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,450
可你是个高尔夫好手又是巴克利的球迷
But you're a big golfer and a bigger Barkley fan,

247
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,030
我想可以借此机会让我们不计前嫌重新开始
and I thought we could use this to get off to a fresh start.

248
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,530
只有一个问题  哈维
Here's the problem, Harvey.

249
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,760
我根本不喜欢查尔斯・巴克利
I don't give a shit about Charles Barkley,

250
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,490
而你也不喜欢我
and you don't give a shit about me.

251
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,660
听我说  这是个示好的举动
Listen to me. This is a gesture.

252
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,160
接受吧
Take it.

253
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,290
我不会接受的
I'm not gonna take it,

254
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,580
我告诉你为什么
and I'm gonna tell you why.

255
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,200
因为你从来不把我当成伙伴
Because you've never treated me like a peer.

256
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,190
你只把我当作是竞争对手
You've only ever treated me like competition.

257
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,490
我很努力了
I'm trying very hard here.

258
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,340
别白费劲了  我不感兴趣
Well, you can stop trying, because I'm not interested.

259
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,150
斯佩克特先生  我发誓他跟我说
Mr. Specter, I swear he told me

260
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,890
他是查尔斯・巴克利的死忠球迷
he was a huge Charles Barkley fan.

261
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,790
我相信  但问题是他撒谎了
I'm sure he did, but the problem is he lied,

262
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,170
你该意识到的
and you should've known it.

263
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,400
不管你要做什么都推后
Whatever you're doing, put it back.

264
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,980
-我需要你  -不行啊
- I need you. - I can't.

265
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,900
什么叫不行  我们就要开战了
What do you mean, you can't? We're about to go to war.

266
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,540
我是说我自己就有一场硬仗要打
I mean, I'm about to go to war myself.

267
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,710
你到底在说什么鬼
What the hell are you talking about?

268
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,450
我要对付凯尔顿保险公司
I'm taking a case against Kelton Insurance.

269
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,860
我现在要去见客户了
I gotta go meet the client right now.

270
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,360
谁同意你接这个案子的
Who the hell authorized that?

271
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,320
杰西卡
Jessica.

272
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,760
现在你不找我找杰西卡了
You went to Jessica instead of me?

273
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,180
我谁也没找  好吗
I didn't go to anyone, all right?

274
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,870
我接下了案子之后她来找我的
She came to me after I took it.

275
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,460
我告诉你  这案子你必须推后
Well, I'm telling you, you're gonna have to postpone it.

276
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,460
哈维  这个案子很重要
Harvey, this case is important.

277
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,500
我告诉你什么才重要
I'll tell you what's important.

278
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,730
这律所的一个合伙人在针对我
I got a partner at this firm coming at me.

279
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,320
我接这个案子的时候还不知道这事
Well, I didn't know that when I committed to this.

280
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,810
怎么回事  我们不是在大堂碰头吗
What the hell? I thought we were meeting in the lobby.

281
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,640
你逗我吧  这案子你和他一起做
You gotta be kidding me. Your case is with him?

282
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,900
说的没错  是和我一起
You're damn right it's with me.

283
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,960
我们还要去给人留个好印象呢
And we have a first impression to make.

284
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,980
我不知道你是怎么教他法律的
I don't know what kind of law you're teaching around here,

285
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,690
但我的老师告诉我  律师要守时
but where I come from, you show up on time.

286
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,630
我们走
Let's go.

287
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,320
你想去
You wanna go?

288
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,390
那就去吧
Go.

289
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,260
杰西卡  有事吗
Jessica, what can I do for you?

290
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,030
你曾找我咨询法律问题
You came to me for some legal advice.

291
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,410
现在轮到我来咨询你了
Now I'm coming to you for yours.

292
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,150
我能收你咨询费吗
Do I get to charge you for it?

293
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,180
你已经收了  除非你突然
You already do, unless you suddenly

294
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,360
开始自掏腰包付法学院的学费了
started paying for law school out of your own pocket.

295
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,940
那就免费吧
Free of charge it is.

296
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,730
我希望你看看这个
I want you to look this over

297
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,370
告诉我里面有没有不妥之处
and tell me if we have any exposure.

298
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,070
好  但这不是协议
Okay, but this isn't a deal.

299
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,060
这是篇演讲稿
This is a speech.

300
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,910
我知道
I'm aware of that,

301
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,790
但格温・巴恩斯很固执己见
but Gwen Barnes is quite opinionated,

302
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,170
我不希望她说出
and I don't want her to say something

303
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,460
招来诉讼的话
that might get her sued.

304
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,220
格温多琳・巴恩斯医生
Dr. Gwendolyn Barnes?

305
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,580
你和她有矛盾吗
Do you have a problem with her?

306
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,770
没有  我有多长时间
No, not at all. How much time do I have?

307
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,830
没有时限
Take as long as you want.

308
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,530
只要等我来要的时候
Just make sure whenever I come back for it,

309
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,730
搞定了就好
it's done.

310
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,470
你来干什么
What are you doing in here?

311
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,840
我是来道歉的
I came to apologize.

312
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,400
你不需要道歉
You don't need to apologize.

313
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,900
我做得过火了
I was out of line.

314
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,250
索罗夫是个混蛋  那不是你的错
Soloff's an asshole, and it wasn't your fault.

315
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,790
不  你没错  的确是我的错
No, you were right. It was my fault.

316
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,650
木已成舟
Well, what's done is done.

317
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,740
你不介意的话  让我单独思考一会儿吧
If you don't mind, I need to think right now.

318
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,280
斯佩克特先生  可木还没成舟呢
I'm sorry, Mr. Specter, but what's done is not done.

319
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,710
什么意思
What are you talking about?

320
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,650
我说过  我是你的后盾
I told you, I got your back.

321
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,550
这是什么
What the hell is this?

322
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,420
那个混蛋第三大客户的简历
It's the bio of that asshole's third biggest client.

323
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,780
-然后呢  -你看他的出身地
- And? - Look where he's from.

324
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,620
我很感激你们能找到这里来
I appreciate you coming all the way down here,

325
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,470
但上次你们来找我的时候
but the last time you came to me,

326
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,170
让我耐心等待  那可是一周前的事了
you told me to sit tight, and that was a week ago.

327
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,560
艾玛  我不懂
Emma, I don't understand.

328
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,070
你希望怎样
What did you expect?

329
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,930
我希望你们理解被晾在一边
I expected you to understand what it feels like

330
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,240
是什么感觉
to be left hanging.

331
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,220
我们要是不理解那感觉
Because if we can't understand that,

332
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,430
等事情变棘手时
what's to stop us from cutting and running

333
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,180
还有什么能阻止我们临阵脱逃呢
when things get tough?

334
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,390
那你们说什么能阻止你们
And what is gonna stop you?

335
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,780
我知道什么事会阻止我
I know what's gonna stop me.

336
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,660
第一年  你每天都在回想
First year...you think about it every day.

337
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,300
情景重现
You relive it.

338
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,810
无论你做什么
Doesn't matter what you do.

339
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,380
都没法将它赶出脑海
You can't get it out of your head.

340
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,050
人们会告诉你这是上帝的安排
People tell you it's part of God's plan.

341
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,440
也许他们没错  但这并没有让你
Maybe they're right, but it doesn't stop you

342
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,810
消除每次听到这句话时
from wanting to punch them in the face

343
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,980
揍他们一拳的冲动
every time they say it.

344
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,780
然后时间流逝
Then time passes,

345
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,470
过了两三年
two, three years.

346
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,000
甚至你可能都开始觉得  一切恢复了平常
Maybe you even start to feel normal.

347
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,150
或许你开始相信
Maybe you start to believe that

348
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,150
这件事并不会
maybe this thing won't actually

349
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,130
对你未来的人生留下伤痕
scar you for the rest of your life.

350
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,100
但突然有一天
But then one day,

351
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,500
某件事让你回想起来
something reminds you.

352
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,650
一首歌或是一股味道
A song or a... or a smell.

353
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,130
触动了那根神经  突然之间
And it touches that nerve, and all of a sudden,

354
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,160
你又回到了听到消息的那天
it's the day you got that news all over again.

355
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,560
你也经历过类似的事情吗
So you have gone through something like this yourself?

356
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,900
我不仅经历过
I haven't just gone through it.

357
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,340
那是我成为律师的全部原因
It's the entire reason that I became a lawyer.

358
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,460
虽然我们让你等了等
And as far as it taking as long as it did,

359
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,270
因为研究细节得花点时间
it took a while to work out the particulars.

360
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,000
但我向你保证
But I can assure you,

361
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,200
等待是值得的
it's worth the wait,

362
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,210
因为在你眼前
because this right here,

363
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,220
就是全明星队  专为你而战
this is an all-star team, and we're playing for you.

364
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,320
那么
Well...

365
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,470
我在哪儿签字
Where do I sign?

366
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,610
好了  这件事处理完了
All right, we got that taken care of.

367
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,340
接下来要做什么
Next step?

368
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,780
安排和解会面
Set up a settlement conference.

369
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,010
说的没错
Got that right.

370
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,250
你是说"说的没错  队友"
You mean "You got that right, partner."

371
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,360
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

372
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,650
那话可是你说的
You're the one that said it yourself.

373
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,630
我们俩是全明星队
You and me, we're the all-star team.

374
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,910
全明星是我  你是那个队伍
I meant I was the all-star. You're the team.

375
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,400
那这个案子里  这个队伍
Oh, so I guess in this case the team

376
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,830
刚投中了决胜球啊
just hit the game-winning jumper.

377
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,360
这么跟你说吧  队伍
I got news for you, team,

378
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,520
比赛还没开始呢
the game hasn't even started yet.

379
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,640
迈克  说真的  刚才
Mike, seriously, back there,

380
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,310
你童年的那些事  我之前都不太理解
about your childhood, I didn't really get it before.

381
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,040
你曾经历不顺
You got dealt a bad hand,

382
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,580
但努力克服困难走到了今天
and you pulled yourself up by your bootstraps,

383
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,760
我很赞赏
and I respect that.

384
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,040
谢谢  罗伯特
Thanks, Robert.

385
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
-你可以叫我"爸"了  -真的吗
- You can call me "Dad." - Really?

386
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,550
假的
No.

387
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,450
你知道我说的是我爸吧
So you know we're talking about my father, right,

388
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,870
他已经去世了
who's no longer alive?

389
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,860
-我忘了  -你忘了
- Yeah, I forgot that. - You forgot that?

390
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,650
那可是你夸我的基础前提啊
The basis of your compliment in the first place?

391
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,990
再有趣的东西也能被你搞无趣  是不是
You suck the fun out of everything, don't you?

392
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,260
完成得很快啊
You did this quickly.

393
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,020
你交给我工作  我做完了而已
You gave me a job to do, and I did it.

394
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,660
那你为什么放在我桌上
And why did you leave it on my desk

395
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,170
而不是当面交给我
instead of bringing it to me directly?

396
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,930
我只想让你能先看一看
I just wanted to give you a chance to look it over.

397
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,480
这跟我让你做的其实是检查
And does that have something to do with the fact

398
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,360
而不是重写的事实
that I asked you to check it for exposure

399
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,640
有什么关系吗
and not rewrite it?

400
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,760
我知道我可能做的超过了任务范畴
I know, I may have overstepped my assignment.

401
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,130
但巴恩斯医生是纽约大医院里
It's just Dr. Barnes is the first black female

402
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,700
第一位黑人女性外科主任
chief of surgery at a major New York hospital.

403
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,370
她面对四处的歧视
She faced discrimination at every turn,

404
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,550
依然完成了工作
and she still got the job done,

405
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,860
她不需要高谈阔论来传达这一点
so she doesn't need soaring language to communicate that.

406
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,360
我会把你的话转达给巴恩斯医生的
I'll tell Dr. Barnes you said that.

407
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,120
所以你接受我的改写
So you're accepting my changes?

408
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,200
我会很高兴的拿给她看
I'll present them to her with my blessing.

409
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,070
看看她怎么想
We'll see what she thinks.

410
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,430
杰西卡
Jessica, um...

411
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,340
如果你哪天代理巴恩斯医生的案子
if you ever have a case with Dr. Barnes,

412
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,100
我很愿意参与
I would love to be a part of it.

413
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,460
我有更好的主意
I have a better idea.

414
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,570
你跟我一起去听演讲怎么样
Why don't you come to the speech with me?

415
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,470
所以我们才需要想个办法
That is exactly why we need to figure out a way

416
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,750
帮你进入康卡斯特董事会
to get you on the board of directors of Comcast.

417
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,520
希望如此吧
From your lips to God's ears.

418
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,430
杰克  抱歉  能跟你谈谈吗
Jack, I'm sorry. Can I speak to you for a second?

419
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,840
我们正忙着呢
Uh, we're kind of in the middle of something.

420
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,410
只要一分钟  是律所事务
It'll only take a minute. It's firm business.

421
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,810
恐怕由不得你选
I'm afraid it's not optional.

422
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,850
抱歉打扰了
I'm sorry to interrupt.

423
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,870
我是哈维・斯佩克特
Harvey Specter, by the way,

424
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,270
皮尔逊-斯佩克特律所合伙人
of Pearson Specter.

425
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,410
我马上回来
This will only take a second.

426
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,920
你以为我不知道你在干什么吗
You think I don't know what you're doing?

427
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,670
你想挖走我的客户
You're trying to poach my client.

428
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,380
你怎么会觉得我想这么做
What makes you think I'm trying to do that?

429
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,810
"哈维・斯佩克特  皮尔逊-斯佩克特律所合伙人"
Please, "Harvey Specter of Pearson Specter."

430
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,870
我告诉你
Let me tell you something,

431
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,570
那家伙做我客户十年了
guy's been my client for ten years.

432
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,430
他不会为你这种人离开我
He's not leaving me for the likes of you.

433
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,870
那我猜这里没什么事了
Then I guess our business here is done.

434
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,220
怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

435
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,740
没什么  你可以走了
Nothing's going on. You're free.

436
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,180
实际上  我还会送你回去
In fact, I'll walk you back.

437
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,840
看啊
Oh, look at that.

438
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,670
查尔斯・巴克利是在跟
Is that Charles Barkley taking a selfie

439
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,740
你那个刚巧在费城长大  经历过巴克利时代的
with your loyal client who happened to have grown up

440
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,370
忠诚的客户玩自拍吗
in Philadelphia during the Barkley era?

441
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,470
你也许不在乎查尔斯
Look, you might not give a shit about Charles,

442
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,400
但他绝对在乎
but he sure as hell does.

443
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,790
你这个贱人
You son of a bitch.

444
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,330
抱歉  杰克  你能再说一遍吗
I'm sorry, Jack. Could you repeat that?

445
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,720
我抢走你客户的声音太大  我都听不清你说什么
I couldn't hear you over the sound of me taking your client.

446
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,740
那让我大声说一遍  这事没完
Then let me say it louder. This isn't over.

447
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,930
最好没完  因为你还有四位
It better be, because you've got four other clients

448
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,460
来自芝加哥  波士顿  洛杉矶和休斯顿的客户
from Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, and Houston.

449
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,730
你也许不认识那些著名球员
And you may not know who those famous ballers are,

450
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,000
但我认识
but I do.

451
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,120
威尔  詹妮弗
Will, Jennifer,

452
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,220
感谢你们出席如此仓促的会面
thank you for seeing us on such short notice.

453
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,550
你们确实给我们客户招来一场诉讼
Well, you did serve our client with a lawsuit.

454
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,980
不过  我们有笔交易给你们
Nevertheless, we have an offer for you.

455
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,950
逗我吧
You've gotta be kidding me.

456
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,620
你把我们千里迢迢喊过来就给我们看这个
You called us all the way down here for this?

457
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,290
我都不屑用它当厕纸
I wouldn't wipe my ass with this.

458
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,270
罗伯特  我们可不这么看
Well, Robert, we don't look at it that way.

459
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,900
那你是怎么看的  威尔
How exactly do you look at it, Will?

460
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,790
我们把这当做是给两只
We look at it as a gift to a couple of vultures

461
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,060
想从一桩旧案的骨头上撕肉吃的秃鹫的礼物
trying to pick the flesh off the bones of an old case.

462
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,140
每个有所隐瞒的律师
That is what every lawyer

463
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,100
都是这么说的
who has had something to hide has ever said.

464
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,410
这也不能改变
And it doesn't change the fact

465
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,780
你的客户害死二百人的事实
that your client killed 200 people.

466
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,740
我们对上个律师是这么说的  现在还是这句话
Then we're gonna tell you what we told the last attorney.

467
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,580
你要是想上法庭  此后十年
You go to trial, you'll be buried in paperwork

468
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,780
你都会被埋在文件堆里
for the next ten years.

469
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,680
换作是昨天
Well, if this were yesterday,

470
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,200
我们也许会被吓到
then we might be rattled by that.

471
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,610
但是后来  我们得到了新信息
But since then, new information has come to light.

472
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,070
什么新信息
And what new information is that?

473
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,250
这是我的律所的雇员名单
This is a list of everyone who works at my firm.

474
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,410
这是我的律所的雇员名单
And this is a list of everyone that works at mine.

475
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,820
我们可不是什么在商场外办公
You see, we're not some solo practitioner

476
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,120
雇佣兼职助手的个体律师
with a part-time paralegal working out of a mall.

477
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,600
我的助理律师的意思是
What my associate is getting at is

478
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,830
我们是两家大律所
we're two huge law firms,

479
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,830
专为告倒你们而设计
perfectly designed to kick your ass.

480
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,930
我不在乎你们律所有多少人
I don't care how many people work at your firms.

481
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,610
总得有人付他们薪水
Someone needs to pay their salaries.

482
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,210
如果你接这个案子
And if you're working on this,

483
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,600
当心付不出薪水
you're not doing that.

484
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,990
那么二百亿对冲基金
Then doesn't it come in handy

485
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,880
就派上用场了
to have a $20-billion hedge fund footing the bill?

486
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,450
所以  你们要么再加几个零
So you can either add a bunch of zeroes to this bullshit offer,

487
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,090
要么我们法庭见
or we'll see you in court.

488
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,180
介意我问你个问题吗
Mind if I ask you a question?

489
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,520
如果是想利用我的关系
If it's about using my connections

490
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,170
请史提夫・汪达来你的婚礼唱歌
to get Stevie Wonder to play at your wedding,

491
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,510
我已经试过了
I already tried.

492
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,730
为什么不告诉我对冲基金的事
Why didn't you tell me about the hedge fund?

493
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,270
钱从哪里来
Well, what difference does it make

494
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,130
有什么区别吗
where we get our money from?

495
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,030
没什么区别
It doesn't make a difference,

496
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,360
只是你完全没跟我提过
except for the fact you didn't tell me.

497
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,640
那你生什么气呢
What are you getting so bent out of shape for?

498
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,140
我们干得挺漂亮啊
We landed a punch back there.

499
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,670
我们  还是你
We landed a punch or you did?

500
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,780
什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

501
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,750
先是说我是你的"助理律师"
First you call me "Associate" in front of opposing counsel,

502
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,540
而后还让我发现有事瞒着我
and now I find out you're keeping things from me.

503
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,750
-听着  -我们到底是不是一个团队
- Look-- - I'm just saying, are we a team or not?

504
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,290
我当时叫你助理律师
I called you what I called you in there

505
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,130
是因为他们想见到说了算的人
because they want to see someone in charge.

506
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,840
看着我们俩  他们会认为是我
And looking at the two of us, they're gonna think it's me.

507
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,120
我没想着告诉你基金的事
And I didn't think about telling you about Arcadian

508
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,420
因为这是你不在的时候我想出来的
because I came up with that when you weren't there.

509
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,100
我得说  我也有过同样的主意
For the record, I had the same idea.

510
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,430
我去找你之前  就找过对冲基金了
I went to a hedge fund before I even came to you.

511
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,630
祝贺你
Well, congratulations.

512
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,370
如果你像我一样搞定了基金的人
If you had closed them like I closed my guys,

513
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,280
我就不用站在这儿自我辩解了
I wouldn't be standing here explaining myself.

514
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,930
等那些跳梁小丑回复后再聊
So let's talk when we hear back from these clowns.

515
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,000
现在笑一个吧  你刚才棒极了
And put a smile on your face. You kicked ass in there.

516
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,500
杰克  有事吗
Jack, what can I do for you?

517
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,140
你可以把你的狗拴好
You can get your dog on a leash.

518
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,380
什么
Excuse me?

519
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,780
哈维刚刚抢走我的一位客户
Harvey just stole one of my clients.

520
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,820
我想把他要回来
I want him back.

521
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:13,970
你有证据吗
Do you have proof?

522
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,590
有  他故意让查尔斯・巴克利
Yeah, he orchestrated some bullshit run-in

523
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,340
跟他偶遇
with Charles Barkley,

524
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,660
然后奇迹发生了  我的客户要换律师
and miraculously my client, he needs to make a change.

525
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,130
这不是证据
Well, that's not proof.

526
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,930
我不需要证据  我知道他做了什么
I don't need proof. I know what the hell he did.

527
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,560
我也知道你和路易
Just like I know what you and Louis did

528
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,660
为了通过你的薪金提案做了什么
to pass your compensation resolution.

529
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,820
如果我有证据
And if I had proof of that,

530
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,410
我们现在就不是在聊这个
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

531
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,050
而是在做你的离职面谈了
We'd be having your exit interview.

532
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,810
你是要指责我
You gonna sling accusations at me,

533
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,840
还是控制好你的这只狗
or you gonna get your dog Harvey under control?

534
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,790
因为如果你控制不了他
'Cause if you can't control him,

535
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,810
也许你也不应该控制这家律所
maybe you shouldn't be in control of this firm.

536
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,870
控制他
Control him?

537
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,250
我告诉你  杰克
Let me tell you something, Jack.

538
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,860
你跟哈维作对  就是在跟我作对
When you went after Harvey, you went after me,

539
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,970
所以一开始就是我
which is why I'm the one

540
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,830
派他去对付你
that sent him after you in the first place.

541
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,920
我刚提出了让所有合伙人都受益的提案
And I just put more money in every other partner's pocket,

542
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,190
所以你最好听我的
which means you better listen to me when I talk.

543
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,110
耍手段让合伙人们支持你做事这一招
There's only so many times you can pull some shady shit

544
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,840
用不了几次就不会再好使了
to get something done with the partners.

545
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,950
所以如果你想挑战我
So you want to take me on?

546
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,520
我乐意奉陪
I'm right here.

547
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,720
忙什么呢
What are you working on?

548
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,640
凯尔顿的案子
The Kelton case.

549
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,940
我正想问你呢
I've been meaning to ask you,

550
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,850
和我爸爸处得怎么样
how's it going with my dad?

551
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,660
挺好
It's fine.

552
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,480
一切...都挺好
It's, uh-- it's going fine.

553
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,070
挺好
Mm-hmm, it's fine.

554
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,380
我知道"挺好"是什么意思
I know what "It's fine" means.

555
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,350
"挺好"意味着根本不好
"It's fine" means it's not fine,

556
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,070
而你意识到我是对的
and you're realizing that I was right

557
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,020
你错了
and you were wrong,

558
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,970
他真的非常不好相处
and he is a giant pain in the ass.

559
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,420
瑞秋  我从没说过我们不会起争端
Rachel, I never said there wouldn't be arguments.

560
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,700
我只是说这些争端最终会让我们更加亲近
I just said ultimately they'd bring us closer.

561
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,930
我知道  你确实是这样说的
I know, you did.

562
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,210
我没想让你烦恼
I'm not trying to cause trouble.

563
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:08,190
我只是在卖萌
I was just trying to be charming and delightful.

564
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,410
谢谢
Thanks.

565
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,850
只是...
It's just--

566
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,040
你爸爸的尊重对我很重要
It's important to me that your dad respects me.

567
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,760
我最能确定的一件事就是
If there is one thing that I am certain of,

568
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,210
我父亲是尊重你的
it's that my father respects you.

569
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,050
明白吗
Okay?

570
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,790
哈维  你是对的
Harvey, you were right.

571
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,740
这是我吃过的最好吃的牛排之一
That's one of the best steaks I ever had.

572
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,850
你还是告诉我你为什么带我来这里吧
How about you tell me why you actually brought me here?

573
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,360
一个人就不能带自己的客户出来吃顿晚餐吗
Can't a man just take his client out to dinner?

574
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,560
别人可能  但你肯定有所图
A man can, but you need something,

575
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,070
而我刚刚已经帮过你那个小忙了
and I just did you that little favor.

576
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,280
那可不算帮忙
That wasn't a favor.

577
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,680
我花了十五分钟和一个费城来的笨蛋拍合照
I took 15 minutes of pictures with some dipshit from Philadelphia.

578
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,860
还不算帮忙吗
That's not a favor?

579
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,920
那只是热身
That was an appetizer.

580
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,640
我需要你让魔术师  伯德
I need you to get Magic, Bird,

581
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,640
{\an8}指"魔术师"埃尔文・约翰逊  拉里・伯德

582
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,690
哈基姆和迈克尔
Hakeem, and Michael

583
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,690
{\an8}指哈基姆-奥拉朱旺和迈克尔・乔丹

584
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,640
也这样做
to do the same thing.

585
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,580
你可真有趣  你在开玩笑对吧
You're a funny guy. You're kidding, right?

586
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,160
那天晚上你给我打电话的时候
Did I ask you if you were kidding me

587
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,720
我问你是不是在开玩笑了吗
when you called me that night?

588
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,520
你让我跟你签约  我已经签了
You asked me to sign with you, and I did.

589
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,090
我还说我有一天会要你还人情
And I also said that I would need something from you someday,

590
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,640
而和一个76人的笨蛋粉丝拍张自拍
and taking selfies with some dipshit Sixers fan

591
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,900
可不算还上这个人情了
isn't gonna cut it.

592
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,490
哈维  你得和这个索罗夫讲和
Harvey, you need to chill with this Soloff thing.

593
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,910
否则每一天你走进办公室
If not, every single day you go into the office,

594
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,830
他都会在想办法给你背后捅刀子
he's gonna be trying to stab you in the back.

595
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,230
我不是来听你的建议的  查尔斯
I'm not here to get your advice, Charles.

596
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,330
我是来让你帮我的
I'm here to get you to help me.

597
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,360
我是不会把梦之队招到一起来帮你的
I'm not getting the Dream Team back together.

598
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,630
只要你想办就一定能办到
It can happen if you make it happen.

599
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,480
我不会办的
It's not gonna happen.

600
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,420
而且我认识的那个哈维是不会让我这样做的
And the Harvey I know would never ask me to do it.

601
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,650
多给些小费
Listen, leave a big tip.

602
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,460
人们以为这顿饭是我出钱呢
People think I'm paying for the meal.

603
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,140
不管你在干什么都先放下
Put down whatever you're doing.

604
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,460
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

605
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,080
你是在和一个冠名合伙人说话
You're talking to a name partner,

606
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,900
我建议你放尊重点
so I suggest you do it with a little respect.

607
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,250
我来找你一起去打击哈维的要害
I'm showing respect by coming to you

608
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,600
已经是尊重你了
to hit Harvey where it hurts.

609
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,530
我告诉你了  我不想扯进
I told you, I don't want anything to do

610
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,690
你和哈维的战争里
with your war with Harvey.

611
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,140
你已经扯进来了
You already have something to do with it.

612
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,920
而你说你不介意我退出
And you said you didn't care if I backed out.

613
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,690
我才不管我说过什么呢
I don't give a shit what I said.

614
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,980
你已经选边站队了  回不了头了
You picked a side. There's no going back.

615
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,530
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

616
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,980
我不会干这件事的  这太过火了  杰克
I'm not doing it. This is way too far, Jack.

617
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,050
不  我们从一开始就该这样干
No, it's what we should have done in the first place.

618
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,030
反正无所谓了
Well, you know, it doesn't even matter,

619
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,730
因为你根本不能提起这样的决议
because you can't introduce a resolution like this,

620
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,930
这有违律所章程
'cause it violates the bylaws.

621
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,760
那你就需要私下里使些手段
Then you need to do some underhanded shit

622
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,870
让它不违反章程
to make it unviolate the bylaws.

623
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,230
我已经告诉过你了
And I already told you

624
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,030
我不会再做那样的事了
that I'm not doing anything like that again.

625
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,130
太糟糕了  因为你已经干过一次了
Too bad, because you did it once.

626
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,570
如果你不想让我告诉别人
And if you don't want me telling anybody about it,

627
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,620
你就得接着干
you'll do it again.

628
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,440
早上好  路易
Good morning, Louis.

629
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,680
看起来你忙了不少事
Well, looks like you've been busy.

630
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,870
是的
I have.

631
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,350
这是克伦肖案的取证记录
Here's the Crenshaw depo,

632
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,400
这是基尔希的行程安排
and this is the Kirsch itinerary,

633
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,990
还有你的音乐盒
and here's your music box.

634
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,330
你为什么要把我的礼物还回来
Why are you giving my gift back?

635
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,050
因为你送我这份礼物的时候保证说
Because it was a gift you gave me with a promise

636
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,540
你绝不会再置我于那样的境地了
never to put me in a position like that again.

637
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,880
-我确实没有  -但你将来会
- And I haven't. - But you will.

638
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
而且不要撒谎说你不会
And don't tell me you won't,

639
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,010
因为我昨天听到你和杰克・索罗夫的小阴谋了
because I overheard your little scheme with Jack Soloff.

640
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,680
那你就应该听到我让他见鬼去吧
Then you obviously heard me tell him to go to hell.

641
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,870
不  路易  我听到他告诉你
No, Louis, I heard him tell you

642
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,850
不管你愿不愿意都得参加这场战争
that you're in this war whether you like it or not.

643
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,450
然后他大摇大摆走出门
And then he walked out that door,

644
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,230
而你一个字都没说
and you didn't say a damn thing.

645
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,880
我发誓我会信守诺言
I swear I'm gonna keep my promise.

646
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,430
我不会去对付哈维的
I am not going after Harvey.

647
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,650
你以为我这是为了保护哈维吗
You think this is about me protecting Harvey?

648
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,230
我这是在保护我自己
This is about me protecting me.

649
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,930
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

650
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,290
那天晚上哈维来找我
Harvey came to me the other night

651
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,260
让我承认我知道你干了什么
to get me to admit that I knew what you did.

652
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,630
他去找你了吗
He came to you?

653
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,820
去我家
In my home.

654
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,280
我不得不站在那里  在他面前
And I had to stand there and lose my integrity

655
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,410
为了你说违心的话
in front of him for you.

656
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,700
天啊  他真的在那样做
Oh, my God, he's really doing it.

657
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,870
做什么
Doing what?

658
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,170
薪金方案投票以后
After the compensation vote,

659
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,640
哈维和我吵了一架
Harvey and I got into a fight,

660
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,170
我告诉他我刚刚夺走了
and I told him that I'd just taken away

661
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,120
他最在乎的一样东西
the one thing he values most:

662
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,000
他的钱
his money.

663
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,400
然后他告诉我他会夺走
He then tells me that he's gonna come

664
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,920
我最在乎的一样东西
after the one thing that I value most.

665
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,740
我
Me.

666
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,810
是的
Yes.

667
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,660
他告诉我  某天  我走进办公室
Told me that one day I would come to this office,

668
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,450
会发现你不见了
you'd be gone,

669
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,980
而我会知道是他从我身边把你夺走的
and I'd know that it was him who took you away from me.

670
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,710
他说他会把我夺走吗
He said he was gonna take me away?

671
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,770
听我说
Listen to me.

672
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,470
我发誓  我绝不会再那样对你了
I swear I will never do that to you again.

673
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,890
但请不要离开我
But please do not leave me.

674
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,020
我不会离开你的  路易
I'm not leaving you, Louis.

675
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,580
你收到这个了吗
You get this?

676
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,730
当然  撤案动议
Sure did. Motion to dismiss.

677
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,240
是的  你知道这意味着什么  对吧
Yeah. You know what this means, right?

678
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,830
我们把他们逼入绝境  他们害怕了
We got 'em on the ropes. They're scared.

679
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,010
所以明天早上
Which is why I scheduled a hearing

680
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,380
我跟赫尔南德斯法官定下了听证会
with Judge Hernandez for tomorrow morning.

681
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,690
她会驳回这鬼东西
She's gonna dismiss this bullshit,

682
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,740
我还会直接让她去开庭
and I'm gonna get her to move straight to trial.

683
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,480
罗伯特  这主意可不好
Uh, Robert, that's a bad idea.

684
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,330
为什么
What are you talking about?

685
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,000
他们出拳  我们就接招
They throw a jab, we answer with a right cross.

686
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,840
是的  如果现在开庭  我们就会得到判决
Yes, if we go to trial now, we get a decision,

687
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,430
但如果三个月后再开庭  我们就可以轰动一时
but if we go in three months, we get a knockout.

688
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,620
你在说些什么
What the hell are you talking about?

689
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,200
州长桌上摆着一份法案
There's a bill on the governor's desk

690
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,450
等着通过
waiting to be passed.

691
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,960
是提升惩罚性损失赔偿的上限的法案
It lifts the cap on punitive damages.

692
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,350
他还没批准是有原因的
There's a reason he hasn't signed it yet.

693
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,060
美国医学会盯着他呢
The A.M.A. is up his ass.

694
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,380
我们现在动手
We go now.

695
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,960
凯尔顿保险公司的首席执行官的合同到期了
The C.E.O. of Kelton Insurance's contract is up.

696
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,710
他不会想因为被控杀人
He doesn't want to be renegotiating

697
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,310
上报纸头条
while he's on the front page of the journal

698
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,180
害得自己要重谈合约
being accused of killing people.

699
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,660
那种威胁可以让那些人
That threat takes these people

700
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,020
将赔偿从一千美元提高到五千美元
from $1,000 per person to $5,000,

701
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,540
但如果我们真上了法庭
but if we actually go to trial--

702
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,970
如果我们上法庭  我们可能什么都得不到
If we go to trial, we may get nothing.

703
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,760
我不想再谈了
And I'm finished having this conversation.

704
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,410
我看出来了  我们不是搭档
So now I see where we stand. We're not partners.

705
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,320
我只是个助理律师
I'm just the associate.

706
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,620
只有你说了算
You're the one calling the shots.

707
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,660
我想第一次谈的时候
I thought I made that clear

708
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,070
我就已经说得很清楚了
from the second we started this thing.

709
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,560
现在回复这项动议  搞定我的动议
Now answer this motion, get my motion done,

710
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,800
明天到法庭来
and be in court tomorrow morning,

711
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,110
因为无论你愿不愿意  我会做到
because this is gonna happen whether you like it or not.

712
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,530
搞什么鬼
Oh--what the hell?

713
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,730
什么搞什么鬼
What the hell what?

714
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,090
你撞翻了我的咖啡
You spilled my coffee.

715
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,300
是你撞到我
You ran into me.

716
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,020
我不在乎谁撞到谁
I don't care who ran into who.

717
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,310
这是我的办公室  你不打算说声"对不起"吗
This is my office. How about a little "Excuse me"?

718
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,540
好  哈维  对不起
Oh, okay, Harvey. Excuse me.

719
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,630
请自愿帮我付干洗的账单
Feel free to send me the bill for dry cleaning.

720
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,640
我可以付这里其他一切费用
I'm paying for everything else around here.

721
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,240
唐娜  现在不是时候
Donna, now is not a good time.

722
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,390
我不管
I don't care.

723
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,380
我可不是你报复路易的筹码
I'm not a prize to be used to get revenge on Louis.

724
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,550
你在说些什么
What the hell are you talking about?

725
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,180
你要否认你对他说
Are you gonna deny you told him

726
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,460
你要把我夺回来吗
that you were gonna take me back?

727
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,920
我没那么说
That is not what I said.

728
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,160
别跟我耍律师那一套
No, do not lawyer me,

729
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,940
因为也许那不是你的原话
because it may not be exactly what you said,

730
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,100
但别告诉我你没有暗示过
but don't try to tell me it wasn't what you meant.

731
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,000
-唐娜  -还有  你为什么会觉得
- Donna... - And another thing, what makes you think

732
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,060
如果我会离开路易
if I were ever to leave Louis

733
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,750
还会回到你身边
that I would ever, ever come back to you?

734
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,720
斯佩克特先生  我知道现在不是时候
Mr. Specter, I know this is a bad time,

735
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,950
但我必须提醒你
but I have to remind you that--

736
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,240
我知道  杰西卡要见我
I know! Jessica wants to see me.

737
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,940
唐娜  我能跟你谈谈吗
Donna, hey, can I talk to you for a second?

738
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,340
现在真不是时候
It's actually not a good time right this second.

739
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,510
这很重要
It's important.

740
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,120
我只想知道
I just need to know

741
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,210
哈维跟赫尔南德法官关系还是很好吗
if Harvey is still tight with Judge Hernandez.

742
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,230
干什么
Why?

743
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,340
我要她为我把听证会延期
I need her to postpone a hearing for me.

744
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,070
知道吗  迈克
You know what, Mike?

745
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,320
如果你要哈维帮忙
If you want something from Harvey,

746
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,060
你就自己去跟他说
you're gonna have to ask him yourself.

747
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,280
你想见我
You wanted to see me?

748
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,280
十二小时前我就叫你来
That was 12 hours ago.

749
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,370
我那时正在安排事情
I was putting some things in order.

750
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,240
安排什么
What things in order,

751
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,220
从杰克・索罗夫那偷更多客户吗
stealing more of Jack Soloff's clients?

752
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,600
说实话  是的
As a matter of fact, yes.

753
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,640
见鬼  哈维
God damn it, Harvey.

754
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,870
杰西卡  我去找他  努力想和解
Jessica, I went in there. I tried to make peace.

755
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,850
可他却羞辱我
He spat in my face.

756
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,490
我再次努力  他仍旧那样
I tried again. He did it again.

757
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,600
于是我说  我受够了
And I said, "Enough is enough".

758
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,920
那你走就是了  不能偷他的客户啊
Then you walk out the door. You don't steal his clients.

759
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,720
知道吗  这不关你的事
You know what? This doesn't concern you.

760
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,900
是我和杰克的事
This is between me and Jack.

761
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,010
他来找我之前  确实是你和杰克的事
Oh, it was between you and Jack until he came to me,

762
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,530
而我还得包庇你
and I had to cover for you.

763
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,740
你包庇我
You covered for me?

764
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,640
说对了
Goddamn right I did.

765
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,660
我跟他说  从一开始
I told him sending you after him was my idea

766
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,420
就是我派你去的
in the first place.

767
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,690
这不是包庇我
That's not covering for me.

768
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,150
而是包庇你自己
That's covering for you,

769
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,300
因为一开始  这就应该是你的主意
because that should have been your idea in the first place,

770
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,550
而不是背着我  让我们所有的竞争对手
instead of welcoming every competitor we have

771
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,480
都跑到公司来
into our offices behind my back.

772
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,700
你在说些什么
What the hell are you talking about?

773
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,470
我说的是罗伯特・赞恩
I'm talking about Robert Zane

774
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,410
你没有告诉我  就让他过来了
and you bringing him in here without consulting me.

775
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,420
我可没让他来
I didn't bring in shit.

776
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,830
是迈克・罗斯没打招呼就把他叫来了
Mike Ross brought Zane in without asking,

777
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,740
我还得假装知道这件事
and I had to pretend to be on board with that too.

778
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,600
现在你在期待事情向你希望的方向发展
And now you're hoping this leads to what you always wanted.

779
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,090
事情结束了  赞恩走了
This thing's over, Zane goes,

780
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,470
迈克跟他一起走了
and Mike heads out the door with him.

781
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,660
够了
That's enough.

782
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,820
你别再发疯了
You need to get yourself under control right now.

783
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,200
你在说些什么
What the hell are you talking about?

784
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,890
我说的是你有问题
I'm talking about you have a problem,

785
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,820
而这个问题跟我没关系
and it doesn't have anything to do with me.

786
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,150
你暴露了这点是因为
And you just expose it by bringing up

787
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,320
你在妄想迈克・罗斯
some paranoid bullshit about Mike Ross

788
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,910
跟罗伯特・赞恩走了
going with Robert Zane.

789
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,640
因为这一切开始于唐娜离你而去
Because this all started when Donna left you,

790
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,330
而现在你害怕迈克也会离你而去
and now you're afraid that Mike's going to do the same thing.

791
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,540
所以你最好解决一下你对被抛弃的恐惧
So you better get your abandonment issues under control,

792
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,880
因为杰克・索罗夫会一直找麻烦
because Jack Soloff is gonna keep coming,

793
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,240
现在你必须战胜他
and now you're gonna have to put him down.

794
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,710
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter,

795
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,870
迈克・罗斯在办公室等你
Mike Ross is waiting for you in your office.

796
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,910
我得跟你谈谈
Hey, I need to talk to you.

797
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,070
现在不要
Not now.

798
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,430
我知道你还在生气  但我需要帮助
I know you're mad from before, but I need a favor.

799
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,770
我说了  现在不要
I said not now.

800
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,060
哈维  你怎么了
Harvey, what's going on with you?

801
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,530
没事  我得喝杯水
Nothing's wrong. I need a glass of water.

802
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,650
怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

803
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,170
好吧  我打911
Okay, I'm dialing 911.

804
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,330
不  别打
No, you're not.

805
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,200
我要打  你可能是心脏病突发
Yes, I am. You could be having a heart attack.

806
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,120
-这不是心脏病突发  -你怎么知道
- It's not a heart attack. - You don't know that.

807
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,850
这是恐慌症
It's a panic attack.

808
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,530
我不想打扰你们的恩爱时刻
Oh, hate to interrupt a special moment,

809
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,970
但我觉得你可能想看看这个
but I thought you might wanna take a gander at this.

810
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,210
那是什么
What the hell is that?

811
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,670
如果你还记得  我们上次的提案
If you recall, our last proposal

812
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,980
减少了风险案件分成
reduced contingent compensation.

813
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,450
而这份提案彻底废除了它
This one wipes it out altogether.

814
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,520
怎么了  不帅气地反击了吗
What's the matter? No snappy comeback?

815
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,510
我读过公司章程  你不能那么做
I've read the bylaws. You can't do that.

816
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,850
你现在要当他的打手了吗
You doing his fighting for him now?

817
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,040
我才不在乎公司章程写了什么
I don't care what the bylaws say.

818
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,660
我有路易的支持
I have Louis's backing.

819
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,070
要么你把客户还给我
So either you give back my client,

820
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,190
要么就和其他所有人一样  达到
or good luck billing 2,500 hours a year

821
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,650
每年2500小时的计费工作时间
like the rest of us.

822
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,450
你尽管提交你的提案等候表决
You go right ahead and put your proposal to a vote.

823
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,180
但是等这个提案通过的时候
But by the time this thing passes,

824
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,800
我早就把你另外四个客户抢走了
I'll have your other four clients.

825
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,720
瞎扯  你不可能已经接触他们了
Bullshit, you couldn't have gotten to them already.

826
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,370
去查吧  他们已经被卷入这场游戏了
Go goddamn check. They're already in play.

827
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,290
这个提案一旦通过
You pass this thing,

828
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,890
你就不可能收到任何报酬了
you won't be billing anything at all.

829
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,270
那样你也没好日子过
You're not gonna get away with that.

830
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,240
错  这场战争不是我开始的
Wrong. I didn't start this,

831
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,480
但将由我来结束
but I'm gonna finish it.

832
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,250
你说我只把你当成竞争对手
And when you said I only ever looked at you as competition,

833
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,430
你错了
you were wrong.

834
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,660
我从没把你放在眼里
I never looked at you as anything at all.

835
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,200
你还好吗
Are you all right?

836
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,660
不好
No.

837
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,310
你刚刚说抢他的客户是真的吗
Is it true what you just said about his clients?

838
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,710
不是  所以我需要你
No, which is why I need you

839
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,790
竭尽所能
to do anything you have to do

840
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,670
让他相信这是真的
to convince him this is happening.

841
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,320
我会搞定的
I'll get it done.

842
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,070
你在这做什么
What are you doing here?

843
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,370
这是我家
This is my home.

844
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,470
也是你的办公室
It's also your office.

845
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,450
办公室的入口在那边
And that entrance is right around there.

846
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,570
抱歉  我正在吃晚餐
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of my dinner.

847
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,130
我打电话预约治疗  你没回
I called to set an appointment. You didn't call back.

848
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,130
因为我有病人在
Because I had patients.

849
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,160
那我又是什么
And what the hell am I?

850
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,940
你是个几星期没跟我见面的前病人
You're an ex-patient I haven't seen in weeks,

851
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,300
我告诉过你如果你不接受你的秘书
who ignored me when I said that your panic attacks

852
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,930
已经离开的事实  恐慌症永远不会痊愈
wouldn't stop until you accepted the fact

853
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,460
但你无视了我
that your secretary wasn't coming back.

854
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,930
我接受了  而且又请了个秘书
I did accept it, and I had another one anyway.

855
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,400
所以我才来这了
That's why I'm here.

856
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,700
你是说你来这是想再拿点药
You mean you're here to get more pills.

857
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,980
没错
Yes, I am.

858
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,260
我给你的那些药呢
And what happened to the ones I gave you?

859
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,160
我扔了
I threw them out.

860
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,700
扯淡  你根本没扔
Bullshit, you didn't throw them out.

861
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,380
你吃完了
You ran out.

862
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,040
不  我没吃完  我说的是真话
No, I didn't run out. I'm telling you the truth.

863
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,110
好吧  无所谓
Okay, well, it doesn't matter,

864
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,150
因为我是个心理医生  不是药房
because I'm a psychiatrist, not a pharmacy,

865
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,900
如果你需要我的帮助  就按我说的来
and if you want my help, you do it my way.

866
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,260
你得按常规预约治疗时间
You make regular appointments,

867
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,000
并且要遵医嘱
and you commit to doing the work.

868
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,090
如果你再突然出现在我家门口
And you show up at my house unannounced again,

869
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,420
我就报警
I'm calling the police.

870
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,900
十分钟之后你有没有时间
Do you have any time available ten minutes from now?

871
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,800
我想给你点时间先吃完晚餐
I want to give you time to finish your dinner.

872
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,030
车准备好了吗
Is the car ready?

873
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,810
就在楼下  和你一样整装待发
It's downstairs warming up, like you.

874
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,290
什么意思
What do you mean?

875
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,260
我收到了邀请函
Well, I received the invitation

876
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,370
并且注意到
and couldn't help but notice

877
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,060
巴恩斯医生参加了这次活动
that Dr. Barnes is in the program,

878
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,540
你也参加了
and you're in the program too.

879
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,890
没错  我确实参加了
Look at that, I am.

880
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,180
为什么不告诉我这就是你的演讲
Why didn't you tell me it was your speech?

881
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,430
我想要你最诚实的意见
I wanted your honest opinion.

882
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,330
但你没问我的意见
But you didn't ask for my opinion.

883
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,690
你让我检查它是否有不妥当的地方
You asked me to check it for exposure.

884
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,580
我注意到你有一个特点
If there's one thing I've noticed about you,

885
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,430
不管有没有人询问
it's that you give your opinion

886
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,930
你都会给出你的意见
whether it's asked for or not.

887
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,020
为什么我的意见对你这么重要
And why does my opinion matter to you so much

888
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,460
以至于让你费尽心思
that you would go through all this?

889
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,250
你的意见对我来说不重要
Your opinion doesn't matter to me.

890
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,020
你的发展才重要
Your development does.

891
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,120
你在说什么
What are you saying?

892
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,300
你要我大声说出来吗
Oh, you're gonna make me say it out loud?

893
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,830
你让我想起了从前的我
You remind me of me.

894
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,100
我要怎么做才能成为现在的你
And what do I have to do to get to be like you?

895
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,690
你一定知道
Well, you should know.

896
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,410
你读了我糟糕的演讲稿
You read my damn speech.

897
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,090
你是说我重写了你那糟糕的演讲稿
You mean I rewrote your damn speech.

898
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,780
该死  我说出口了
Oh, shit, I said it.

899
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,620
我就宽宏大量原谅你了
I'm going to show you mercy,

900
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,870
鉴于你选裙子的眼光
considering your dress choice.

901
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,660
我的裙子怎么了
What's wrong with my dress?

902
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,870
你不知道有多糟糕
Oh, you don't know.

903
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,820
拜托  这条挺特别
Come on, this is really special.

904
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,410
你想知道真相吗
You wanna know the truth?

905
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,610
我认为你抑制了对唐娜的怒气
I think you bottled up your anger at Donna,

906
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,070
在路易身上发泄了出来
let it out at Louis,

907
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,100
然后当怒火再一次燃烧时
and then when it came back at you,

908
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,050
你又压了下去
you pushed it down again.

909
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:49,910
简直是胡扯
That's bullshit.

910
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,310
专业的医学术语称之为情感转移
The clinical term is displacement,

911
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,050
治疗方法就是把对唐娜的怒火发泄出来
and the cure for it is letting your anger at Donna out.

912
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,210
我不会那么做的
Well, I'm not gonna do that,

913
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,180
因为即使我会  唐娜也不在这
because even if I would, Donna's not here.

914
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,200
不  我没说你必须对唐娜发火
No, I didn't say you had to let it out at Donna.

915
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
你可以对我发泄
You can let it out at me.

916
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,720
-那太蠢了  -一点也不蠢
- That's stupid. - No, it isn't.

917
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,890
如果她现在就在这里
If she were here right now,

918
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,570
你脑海中出现的第一句话是什么
what's the first thing that comes to your mind?

919
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,070
唐娜  你在这做什么
Hey, Donna, what are you doing here?

920
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,820
如果我回答  我是为你而来的
What if I said, "I'm here for you"?

921
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,650
我会说  你不是应该在路易的办公室吗
I'd say, "Shouldn't you be at Louis's desk?"

922
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,560
我确实从他那来  这么说你感觉如何
And what if I were? How would that make you feel?

923
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,500
我感觉角色扮演太愚蠢了
It would make me feel like role play is stupid,

924
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,400
因为你不是唐娜
because you're not Donna,

925
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,180
我也不在乎你的学位怎么说
and I don't give a shit what your degree says.

926
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,460
我不想为了拿点药
I'm not gonna go through this again

927
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,700
就又来这一套
just to get more pills.

928
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,830
我可能不是唐娜
Well, I may not be Donna,

929
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,590
但我开始了解她的感受了
but I'm beginning to see what it's like to be her.

930
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,960
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

931
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,460
我在说  我是一个一直被你欺压
I'm talking about I'm a woman

932
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,390
以使你得到一切的女人
who you've been bullying to get what you want.

933
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,670
欺压  我付你钱了
Bullying? I'm paying you.

934
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,480
那并不代表我是为了你的需求而存在
And that doesn't mean that I exist to serve your needs.

935
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,780
可理应如此
Well, it goddamn should.

936
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,050
如果你是这么对唐娜说话的
If you spoke to Donna that way,

937
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,030
难怪她会离开你
no wonder she left you.

938
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,360
因为金钱是不能买到忠诚的
Because you don't just pay people to be loyal.

939
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,350
你怎么敢这么说我
How dare you?

940
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,380
我根本不在乎钱
I don't give a shit about the money, and I never did.

941
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,520
你是不在乎
No, you didn't.

942
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,500
钱只是你让我对你言听计从的工具
It was just a way to get me to do what you wanted.

943
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,210
难道当你命悬一线的时候
So when your life was on the line

944
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,370
我一直支持着你
and I was there for you every step of the way,

945
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:48,910
这对你来说什么都不算么
it meant nothing?

946
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,540
并不是一直
It wasn't every step of the way.

947
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,900
一旦我想要的更多你就退缩了
You bailed out the second I wanted more.

948
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,830
于是你就决定背叛我
That's when you decided to betray me.

949
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,630
放下过去  把我自己放在第一位
How the hell is moving on and putting myself first

950
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,330
怎么就是背叛你了
betraying you?

951
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,760
因为你去了路易那里
Because you went to Louis to do it,

952
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,570
这不是放下过去向前看
and that's not moving on.

953
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,550
是在我身上插了把刀再转两下
That's sticking a knife in my gut and twisting it.

954
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,990
是的  哈维  没错
Yeah, Harvey, it is.

955
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,850
当你是那个被捅的人的时候感觉如何
How does it feel to be on the receiving end for once?

956
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,010
哈维  你听见我说话了吗
Harvey, did you hear me?

957
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,170
我问  当得知你迈出了
I said, how does it feel to know that

958
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,730
重获控制的第一步时  你感觉如何
you've taken the first step towards regaining control?

959
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,970
当有人捅了你一刀
When someone twists a knife in your gut,

960
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,250
我只想捅回去
I feel like I want to twist one right back.

961
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,730
赞恩先生  你安排了这次听证会
Mr. Zane, you scheduled this hearing.

962
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,860
我们已经等了十分钟了
We've been waiting ten minutes.

963
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,410
我不打算再等了
I'm not waiting any longer.

964
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,590
您不需要了  法官大人
Uh, you don't have to, your honor.

965
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,940
我的动议到了
My motion is here.

966
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,890
你最好快点送上来
It better get up here fast.

967
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,040
你去哪儿了
Where the hell were you?

968
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,900
我在这里无所是事
I'm standing up here with my dick in my hand,

969
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,230
你还不紧不慢的
and you're out having a soda.

970
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,610
我有事要处理
I had something to do.

971
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,760
不管是什么事
Yeah, well, whatever it was,

972
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,950
我希望值得你为之差点输了这场官司
I hope it was worth almost losing this case over.

973
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,830
请求加速审判的动议
Motion to expedite trial.

974
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,230
我以为这是一个有关撤销案件的听证会呢
I thought this was a hearing on their motion to dismiss.

975
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,140
如果您加速审判的话
Well, if you expedite our trial,

976
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,340
就不需要撤销本案了
that takes care of their motion to dismiss.

977
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:00,060
法官大人  他们两天前才拿到这个案子
Your Honor, they just got this case two days ago.

978
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,750
他们想利用我们客户合同到期的时间点
They're using the timing of our client's contract expiration

979
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,990
敲诈我们
to try to shake us down.

980
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,190
我必须说  赞恩先生  我很难相信
I have to say, Mr. Zane, I find it hard to believe

981
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,270
两天的时间你就收集了足够的证据
that in two days you've found out enough

982
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,090
发现需要加速审判了
to know you need an expedited trial,

983
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,700
跟别提关心这些人了
let alone care about these people at all.

984
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,030
法官大人  四年前
Your Honor, four years ago,

985
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,700
一个叫做斯坦利・鲍威尔的邮差
a mail carrier named Stanley Powell

986
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,490
感到胸口发闷
felt tightness in his chest.

987
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,970
他觉得没什么大碍
He thought it was nothing,

988
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,380
但他的妻子坚持让他去医院看看
but his wife insisted he go to the hospital.

989
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,580
当他到了那儿
When he got there,

990
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,280
医生查不出什么问题
doctors couldn't find anything wrong,

991
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,280
但他们希望他能留院观察一天
but they wanted to keep him for one extra day.

992
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,150
但不幸的是
Now unfortunately,

993
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,110
凯尔顿保险公司拒绝承担这笔费用
Kelton Insurance refused to pay.

994
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,300
于是鲍威尔先生就回家了  爬上了床
So Mr. Powell went home, crawled into bed,

995
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,050
第二天  他就去世了
and one day later, he was dead.

996
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,550
在您面前  是一份长达五千页的
In front of you, you have a complaint

997
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,280
起诉书
that's over 5,000 pages long,

998
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,380
讲述了其他189个受害者的故事
which tells the stories of another 189 victims.

999
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,600
随便挑一页  告诉我页码
Pick a page at random, tell me the number,

1000
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,830
我会一字不差的告诉您他们的客户对他们做了什么
and I will tell you exactly what their client did to them.

1001
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,350
法官大人  您真的相信他这套么
Your Honor, are you actually buying that?

1002
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,690
第627页  劳
Page 627, Mr.--

1003
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,700
劳伦斯・格林
Lawrence Green.

1004
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,470
六十三岁的一位祖父
63-year-old grandfather,

1005
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,520
因为腰背部疼痛和严重的体重下降
admitted to St. Vincent with complaints of lower back pain

1006
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,260
被圣文森特医院接收入院
and excessive weight loss.

1007
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,660
他以为是因为压力过大  结果是因为淋巴瘤
He thought it was stress. Turns out it was lymphoma.

1008
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,780
但他们发现时已经太晚了
Only they didn't find out until it was too late

1009
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,780
因为他们的客户拒绝支付核磁共振的费用
because their client refused to pay for the MRI.

1010
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,010
所以  如果您一定要驳回我们的动议请便
So please, rule against us if you have to,

1011
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,700
但别说我们不在乎
but don't tell me we don't care.

1012
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,420
加速审判动议通过
Motion for expedited trial granted.

1013
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,380
下周一选陪审团成员
Jury selection starts Monday.

1014
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,620
顺便说一句  这是我之前在做的事
For your information, that's what I was doing.

1015
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,000
之所以花了这么久
And it only took as long as it did

1016
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,130
是因为我同时在为唯一一个
because I was also doing something for the one person

1017
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,520
有权把我当做他的助理律师
who has the right to treat me like his associate

1018
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,350
却把我当做合伙人对待的人做事
but treats me like his partner anyway.

1019
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,080
如果你能原谅我的话
Well, if you can forgive me,

1020
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,550
我带我的合伙人去吃个午饭你看如何
what do you say I take my partner out to lunch?

1021
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,520
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter--

1022
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,800
格蕾琴  不管什么事  都等明天再说
Gretchen, whatever it is, it can wait till tomorrow.

1023
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,580
恐怕这不能等
I'm afraid this can't wait.

1024
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,840
这是你的简历
This is your resume.

1025
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,830
我想解释一下我职业生涯中的
I wanted to explain the two-year gap

1026
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,280
两年中断期
in my employment history.

1027
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,050
你不需要这么做
You don't have to do that.

1028
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,660
我的丈夫去世了
My husband passed away.

1029
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,840
我的孩子长大了
My children were grown.

1030
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,650
我没有了目标  感觉很孤独
I had no purpose, I felt alone,

1031
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,330
于是我开始有恐慌症
and I started having panic attacks.

1032
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,160
我为什么需要知道这些
And why would I need to know that?

1033
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,850
因为我现在没有了
Because I don't have them anymore.

1034
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,070
晚安  格蕾琴
Good night, Gretchen.

1035
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,370
那是什么情况
What was that all about?

1036
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,150
了解我的新秘书
Getting to know my new secretary.

1037
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,860
你是来炫耀帮我搞定了杰克的吗
Did you come by just to brag about helping me with Jack?

1038
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,650
看来他认输了
I take it that means he backed down.

1039
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,140
就像罗伯特・杜兰面对苏格・雷一样
Like Roberto Duran against Sugar Ray.

1040
