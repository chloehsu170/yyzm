5
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,550
-我想讓自己合法化  -你不能
- I want to go legit. - You can't.

6
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,410
那我找羅拉·詹森黑進資格考名單
Then I get Lola Jensen to hack into the bar

7
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,530
把我名字加進去  就像她黑哈佛一樣
and just put me in there, just like she did with Harvard.

8
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:12,910
不想被人抓到辮子
Rule number one of not getting caught,

9
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,500
就是別輕舉妄動
you don't move the goddamn body.

10
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,650
哈維  我無路可走了
Harvey, I'm stuck.

11
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,520
我不能這樣過一輩子
I can't live my whole life like this.

12
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,940
你想讓我幫你建立新公司嗎
You want me to set up your new corporation?

13
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,860
我想讓你加入我的新公司
I want you to join my new corporation.

14
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,650
我們不是律師  我們是投資銀行家
We're not lawyers. We're investment bankers.

15
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,580
我們的工作比你們的厲害多了
Our job blows yours out of the water.

16
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,800
斯科特  我需要你把案子還給路易
Scottie, I need you to give Louis his transaction back.

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,460
這和他之前幫你的那個忙有關系嗎
Does this have something to do with that favor he did you?

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,690
-是的  -那告訴我是什么事
- Yes. - Tell me what it is.

19
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,190
-不行  -看來我們根本不是
- I can't. - Guess we're not sharing

20
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,700
分享所有秘密了
everything with each other after all.

21
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,110
-斯科特  -你不能二者兼得  哈維
- Scottie. - You can't have it both ways, Harvey.

22
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,640
-路易  我不想要孩子  -你在說什么啊
- Louis, I don't want kids. - What are you talking about?

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,340
我不喜歡小孩
I don't like kids.

24
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,940
我為了你愿意放棄哈佛
I was willing to give up Harvard for you.

25
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,170
你就不能為我放棄點什么嗎
You can't give up something for me?

26
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,610
我知道  我能說兩句嗎
I understand. Can I just say something please?

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,240
我知道你一直說我不會永遠這樣
I know you keep saying that I won't feel this way forever,

28
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,110
但為什么送咖喱雞的人
but why is it when the guys shows up

29
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,890
遲到了四十分鐘
with chicken vindaloo 40 minutes late

30
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,110
還沒拿烤餅和銀制餐具
with no naan and no silverware,

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,020
我不僅沒有甩他一臉酸辣醬
instead of throwing the chutney in his face,

32
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,950
還謝了他  又給他二十塊錢小費
I'm thanking him and I am tipping him $20?

33
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,820
你要告訴我這到底是怎么回事嗎
Do you want to tell me why that happens?

34
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,120
我不管  我厭惡自己
I don't care. I hate myself.

35
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,740
我厭惡我的人生
I hate my life.

36
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,580
我愛的女人離開了  我的心支離破碎
The woman I love is gone, my heart is broken,

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,200
我真的  老實跟你說吧
and I really-- to be honest with you,

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,760
我不想活了
I just don't have the will to live.

39
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,220
別掛電話  是我手下的初級律師
Hold on. It's my associate.

40
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,140
卡特里娜
Katrina.

41
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,070
路易  現在是7點55分
Louis, it's 7:55.

42
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,450
我八點有個會
Yeah. I have an 8:00 a.m.

43
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,910
幫我兜一下  事實上  所有事都幫我搞定
Please cover it for me. In fact, cover everything,

44
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,200
除非律所著火了  而且希拉在里面
and unless the building is on fire and Sheila's in it,

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,300
-不然我都不去了  -路易  怎么回事
- I'm not coming in. - Louis, what happened?

46
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,690
你想知道怎么回事  那我就告訴你
You wanna know what happened? I'll tell you what happened.

47
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,740
我的心碎成渣渣了
My heart's been shattered into a thousand million pieces,

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,180
如果我沒法把心思放在工作上
and if I can't put my heart into my work,

49
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,310
那我就干脆不去工作了  所以...
then I'm not gonna do any work at all, so...

50
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,620
那你什么時候回來
How long do you think you'll be out?

51
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,320
不知道  也許今天  也許明天
I don't know. Today, tomorrow,

52
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,540
也許今年都不會回去了
the rest of the year.

53
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,780
別再打給我了
You know, just don't call here again

54
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,440
因為我不會再接這個號碼了
because I'm not gonna answer the number.

55
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
醫生
Doc?

56
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,140
利普希茨醫生
Dr. Lipschitz?

57
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,490
喂
Hello?

58
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,890
你他媽坑我呢  根本沒到五十分鐘
What, are you shitting me? That was not 50 minutes.

59
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,110
在外面等我  夠厚顏無恥的
Waiting outside for me? Bold gesture.

60
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,460
打了三個電話都沒接  總得做點什么吧
I called you three times. I had to do something.

61
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,490
-你心里一定很不舒服吧  -是的
- You must be feeling bad. - I am.

62
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,410
何必呢  你只是做好本份工作而已
What for? You're just doing your job.

63
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,440
斯科特  對不起
Scottie, I'm sorry.

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,790
路易那件事  我也不想這么做的
What happened with Louis, I didn't like doing it.

65
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,920
-但你還是做了  -我現在想請你
- Yeah, but you still did it. - And what I'm doing now

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,380
讓這事過去
is asking you to let it go.

67
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,480
哈維  我生氣不是因為你選擇路易而不是我
Harvey, it's not that you picked Louis over me.

68
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,740
而是你不肯告訴我原因
It's that you wouldn't tell me why.

69
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,690
我是不能告訴你  有區別的
I couldn't tell you why. There's a difference.

70
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,770
請你相信我
And I'm asking you to trust me.

71
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,390
好吧
Okay.

72
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,650
我可以不計較  但你也不能
I can let it go, but keeping things from me

73
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,780
什么事都瞞著我  行嗎
just can't keep happening, okay?

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,750
我說不好到底行不行
I can't tell you whether or not that's okay,

75
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,800
但我一定不能告訴你原因
and I definitely can't tell you why.

76
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,560
太早說笑了嗎
Too soon?

77
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,910
你要怎么補償我
What are you going to do to make it up to me?

78
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,310
現在不行
Nothing right now.

79
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,980
我要帶邁克去馬拉松跑鞋公司早午餐
I'm taking Mike to the Marathon Footwear brunch.

80
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,590
你要攜伴參加首次公開募股會
You're taking a date to an I.P.O. event?

81
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,500
-真貼心  -他不是我的伴侶
- That's so cute. - It's not a date.

82
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,610
他可不會向我獻身
He's never gonna put out.

83
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,870
你不帶我去真是可惜了
Well, it's too bad that you're not taking me

84
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,000
因為我可是準備讓你...
because I was thinking of letting you...

85
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,310
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter.

86
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,440
我是詹姆斯·柯靈
James Quelling.

87
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,350
我有點趕時間  柯靈先生
I'm in a bit of a hurry, Mr. Quelling.

88
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,980
-我想幫你一個忙  -我不需要人幫忙
- I want to do you a favor. - I don't need any favors.

89
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,760
你需要的  除非你想看到周五的頭條寫著
Yeah, you do, unless you want Friday's headline to read,

90
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,830
"馬拉松跑鞋公司建造害死孩子的游樂場"
"Marathon Footwear builds playgrounds that kill children."

91
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,140
我客戶建造的是幫助孩子的游樂場
My client builds playgrounds that help children.

92
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,160
所用的合成物卻充滿毒質
And uses a synthetic full of toxins to do it.

93
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,730
我不知道你是誰
Look, I don't know who you are,

94
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,160
但我知道你想干什么  沒用的
but I know what you're trying to do, and it isn't gonna work.

95
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,650
我是個講理之人
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

96
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,620
現在對你委托人來說是個重要時刻
This is a huge moment for your client.

97
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,760
我會拖到周五才公開
I won't file this before Friday.

98
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,300
你認為我會坐視不管你敲詐我的委托人嗎
You think I'm gonna let you extort my client?

99
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,670
不  我認為你會保護你的委托人
No, I think you're gonna protect your client

100
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,700
不讓一件索賠案毀了他們
from a claim that could ruin them.

101
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,200
事實上  我就指望你這么做呢
In fact, I'm counting on it.

102
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,060
辦公室挺漂亮  好好享受早午餐吧
Nice offices. Enjoy that brunch.

103
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,990
-我收到了一份工作邀約  -天哪  誰給的
- I got a job offer. - Holy shit. From who?

104
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,710
昨晚  喬納森·西德威爾
Last night. Jonathan Sidwell.

105
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,600
他的律師不是路易嗎
But I thought Louis was his lawyer.

106
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,340
他不要我做他的律師
He doesn't want me to be his lawyer.

107
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,300
他要我入伙
He wants me to be a partner.

108
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,700
-投資銀行  -對
- Investment banking? - Yeah.

109
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,970
-然后呢  -我不知道
- And? - I don't know.

110
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,020
-你怎么想  -我不知道
- What do you think? - I don't know.

111
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,860
-你怎么看  -我愛你
- What do you think? - I think that I love you,

112
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,840
你想做的就是我想做的
and what you want to do is what I want you to do.

113
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,190
我不知道該怎么辦
I don't know what to do.

114
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,510
好吧  你跟哈維說了嗎
Okay. Did you talk to Harvey?

115
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,300
如果我跟他說  他只會曲解為
If I do that, all he'll hear is, "Hey, Harvey,

116
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,470
"哈維  謝謝你為我做的一切
"Thanks for doing everything for me.

117
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,240
我準備辭職了"
I'm thinking about quitting."

118
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,930
但你說你沒把他看作是上司
No, but you said that you don't think of him as just your boss.

119
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,420
你當他是朋友
You consider him a friend.

120
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,880
-那又怎樣  -那如果他不能為你著想
- So? - So if he can't have an honest conversation

121
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,970
跟你好好談談
with your best interests in mind,

122
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,030
那他就不是你的朋友  也不該做你的上司
he's not your friend, and-- and he shouldn't be your boss.

第三季   第十五集

131
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,110
我有事要跟你說
I have to talk to you about something.

132
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,720
除非你的事價值超過5.75億美元
Well, unless its value is in excess of $575 million,

133
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,830
不然就得等著了
it can wait.

134
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,300
好  我的事能等
Yeah. Yeah, it can wait.

135
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,630
很好  除非我們能處理好這件事
Good because our I.P.O. is in jeopardy

136
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,210
不然首次公開募股可就岌岌可危了
unless we can deal with this.

137
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,990
危害兒童  這些游樂場才剛開放
Endangering children? Wait, these things just opened.

138
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,420
這索賠就是扯淡
This is a bullshit claim.

139
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,620
也許  但在正確日子的扯淡索賠
Maybe, but a bullshit claim on the right day

140
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,570
也比鬼日子的完美索賠攻擊力更大
is better than a great claim on a bullshit day.

141
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,230
這話是你自己想到的嗎
Did you come up with that all by yourself?

142
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,950
我祖母教我的
My grandmother taught it to me.

143
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,340
-需要我做什么  -我要你挖出
- What do you need me to do? - I need you to find

144
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,510
這個叫柯靈的家伙的所有事
everything there is to know about this Quelling guy.

145
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,390
哈維  為什么不干脆給他錢就算了
Harvey, why don't you just pay him off?

146
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,480
保護首次公開募股
Protect the I.P.O.?

147
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,010
我為這一天勞心勞力
I worked my ass off for this day.

148
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,100
他想敲詐我  我可不會被什么
He's trying to hijack it. I'm not gonna be extorted

149
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,650
毫無名氣的狗屎敲詐
by some piece of shit I've never heard of.

150
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,100
好吧  這就去辦
Okay. On it.

151
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,950
杰西卡
Jessica.

152
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,510
唐娜  有什么事嗎
Donna, what can I do for you?

153
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,100
我剛剛走過前臺
I was just walking by reception,

154
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,650
我覺得你可能會想知道
and I thought you might like to know--you know,

155
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,510
-因為這是你的公司  -唐娜  直說
- because it's your firm and- - Donna, get to it.

156
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,160
查爾斯·范·戴克在大堂
Charles Van Dyke is in the lobby.

157
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,300
-現在嗎  -三十秒之前
- Right now? - 30 seconds ago.

158
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,580
你來找我是對的
You were right to come to me.

159
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,900
要我去把他打發走嗎
Would you like me to send him on his way?

160
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,110
我更想自己去對付查爾斯·范·戴克
I prefer to take care of Charles Van Dyke myself.

161
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,150
很好
Excellent.

162
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,740
你再怎么盯著它  查爾斯
You can stare at it all you want, Charles,

163
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,390
也無法改變什么
but it's not going to change.

164
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,390
我只是在想
I was just thinking,

165
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,850
真不敢相信你把郵件室小工的名字
"I can't believe you put the mailroom boy's name

166
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,610
-掛在墻上了  -我想你真正的意思是
- on the wall." - I think what you mean is

167
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,840
你仍不敢相信你的名字居然也會被摘下來
that you can't believe yours was ever taken off.

168
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,280
那事我早放下了
I put that behind me years ago.

169
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,740
你來干什么  查爾斯
What are you doing here, Charles?

170
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,870
我們去你辦公室談吧
I suggest we go in your office and talk.

171
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,200
在這兒就挺好
Right here is just fine.

172
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,220
你想怎么樣
What do you want?

173
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,860
我要我的股利分紅上調30%
I want a 30% increase in my dividend check.

174
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,320
-滾蛋吧  -我就猜到你會這么說
- Good-bye, Charles. - I thought you'd say that.

175
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,750
這是我要求審計你們賬簿的正式通知書
This is formal notice of my demand to audit your books.

176
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,720
周五前回復
You have until Friday to comply.

177
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,640
我們把你趕出去的時候你就放棄這個權利了
You gave up this right when we ran you out of town.

178
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,090
但你忘記我保留了
I think you're forgetting I retain that right

179
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,060
在股息發生實質改變的情況下進行審計的權利
in the event of any material change in my dividend.

180
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,090
你的股息提高了
Your dividend went up.

181
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,300
這就是實質改變啊
Materially.

182
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,040
你覺得我們在隱瞞盈利
You think we're hiding profits.

183
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,290
據我對你的了解  你總有所隱瞞
From what I know of you, you're always hiding something.

184
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,930
-我就快點說了  吉姆  -是詹姆斯
- I'm gonna make it fast, Jim. - James.

185
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,540
你前妻可不是那么喊你的
That's not what your ex-wife calls you.

186
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,320
她喊你吉姆
She calls you Jim.

187
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,280
那還算是比較好的稱呼了
That's one of the nicer names she uses.

188
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,460
她現在喊你的花樣可多了
She's been calling you a lot these days.

189
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,140
你們知道我離婚了
Wow, you found out I'm divorced.

190
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,950
好吧  那我撤訴了
Well, I'll withdraw the lawsuit.

191
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,330
不是離婚的問題  吉姆
It's not the divorce, Jimbo,

192
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,720
而是你故意輸掉煙草危害訴訟后
it's the huge wall of mounting debt that's closing in on you

193
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,490
欠下的一屁股債
since you tanked the tobacco litigation.

194
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,390
我不是故意的  就是輸了
I didn't tank it. I lost.

195
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,640
你不止是輸了
You didn't just lose.

196
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,380
你本來有一份十分豐厚的和解交易
You had an offer that would have set you up for life.

197
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,480
但你卻賭了一把  尋求判決
Instead, you rolled the dice, went to verdict,

198
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,650
結果滿盤皆輸
and now you got nothing.

199
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,630
所以你妻子才離開你
Which is why your wife left you,

200
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,500
現在你又拿個虛構的索賠來找我們麻煩
and now you're coming after us with a fabricated claim.

201
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,140
我沒有虛構什么  我有專家的報告
I didn't fabricate anything. I have expert reports here.

202
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,440
那不過是一份操場制造材料
You've got one report of possible toxins

203
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,500
可能有毒性的報告
in the playground material.

204
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,030
而且沒有任何孩子生病
And not one sick child.

205
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,770
而你們周五有首次募股
And you have an I.P.O. on Friday,

206
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,990
如果那天早上這份訴訟出現在報刊上
and if this suit appears in the Journal that morning,

207
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,420
你覺得募股開始后
what do you think the stock price is gonna be

208
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,920
股價走勢會如何
when they ring that bell?

209
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,240
被你將住了  報價吧
Got me. Give me your number.

210
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,370
-十萬  了事  -了事
- 100,000 and we're done. - Done.

211
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,380
-我們會起草文件  -我弄好了
- We'll draw up the paperwork. - I've got it right here.

212
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,780
但有一點  今后
But one thing, this precludes you

213
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,520
你不得再代表其他原告提出同一指控
from representing any other plaintiffs with the same action.

214
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,240
被你將住了
You got me.

215
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,550
我還有一百個原告在等著呢
I have 100 other plaintiffs waiting in the wings.

216
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,930
你們剛剛避免了一千萬的損失
That's a $10 million hit you just avoided.

217
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,270
這樣吧
I tell you what.

218
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,380
給我一百萬  我們就真了事
Give me a million, and we're really done.

219
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,720
詹姆斯  這筆錢償還你的債務綽綽有余了
James, this covers your debts and gets you out from under.

220
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,790
所以你覺得我會被小錢打發嗎
You think that means I'm gonna take less than it's worth?

221
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,020
-這根本不值錢  -今天值錢
- It isn't worth anything. - It is today.

222
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,350
你們知道怎么找我
You know where to reach me.

223
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,380
你不是說你最高能接受
Thought you said you were willing to go

224
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,450
-五十萬嗎  -那是之前
- as high as 500,000. - Yeah, that was before

225
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,480
我當時還不知道對手是什么人
I realized what we were dealing with.

226
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,040
他欠錢不是因為離婚
This guy doesn't owe money 'cause he got divorced.

227
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,520
而是因為欠錢才會離婚
He got divorced 'cause he owes money.

228
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,760
-什么意思  -他是個賭徒
- What are you talking about? - He's a gambler.

229
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,330
這有什么用
How does that help us?

230
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,060
他不知道我也是
He doesn't know I'm one.

231
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,330
路易呢
Where's Louis?

232
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,530
-杰西卡  -他人呢
- Jessica. - Where is he?

233
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,080
他不接電話  也不回郵件
He's not answering his phone. He's not answering his emails.

234
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,920
問題是  我不知道他...
The thing is I don't know if he--

235
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,790
卡特里娜  你守大門的那套
Katrina, your job as gatekeeper

236
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,250
在我這兒不適用  我再問你一次
does not apply to me, so I'm going to ask you one more time.

237
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,180
路易為什么不在樓里
Why isn't Louis in the building?

238
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,910
他肯定還在法院
He must still be in court.

239
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,960
-我能做什么嗎  -你能做的
- Is there something I can do? - What you can do

240
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,100
就是找到路易  讓他想辦法
is find Louis and have him come up with a way around

241
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,950
避免我們被查賬
this demand to look at our books.

242
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,830
我跟他說什么時候需要
When should I tell him you need it?

243
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,060
昨天
Yesterday.

244
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,670
你說得對  柯靈有賭局
You were right. Quelling's got a game.

245
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,730
-哪晚  -每晚
- What night? - Every night.

246
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,810
你最好知道今晚的賭局在哪
Well, I hope you know where tonight's game is because--

247
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,870
很好
Great.

248
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,230
我們去
You and I are going.

249
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,300
什么
What?

250
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,080
我得到了一份工作邀請  哈維
I got a job offer, Harvey.

251
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,930
今晚約好去邊喝邊談的
Supposed to go have drinks to talk about it tonight.

252
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000
人人影視
YYeTs.com

253
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,820
我可以改期  但是...
I can move it, it's just, that's...

254
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,320
這是我遲疑的原因
that's why I hesitated.

255
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,800
-什么時候  -你指什么
- When? - When what?

256
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,220
你什么時候收到的邀請
When'd you get the job offer?

257
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,150
-前兩天晚上  -你沒跟我說
- The other night. - And you didn't mention it.

258
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,200
我當時不知道該怎么想
I didn't know what I thought.

259
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,860
-現在想清楚了  -不是
- And now you do? - No. It's--

260
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,880
是誰
Who?

261
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,360
喬納森·西德威爾
Jonathan Sidwell.

262
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,650
分拆的主意
The spin-off idea?

263
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,180
-嗯  -我該料到的
- Yeah. - I should have known.

264
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,140
他要你做他的法律總顧問嗎
He wants you to be his general counsel?

265
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,600
不  他想讓我做投資銀行家
No, he wants to make me an investment banker.

266
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,670
如果是我  我就接受
Well, if it were me... I'd take it.

267
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,550
什么  為什么
What? Why?

268
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,920
因為你在那兒也會像在這兒一樣游刃有余
Because you can compete there like you do here

269
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,320
而且還不用擔心東窗事發
with nothing hanging over your head.

270
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,200
如果我不想離開律師界呢
What if I don't want to stop being a lawyer?

271
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,360
那就別接受
Well, then don't take the job.

272
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,410
你想我說什么啊
I mean, what do you want from me?

273
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,590
-我想要你的建議  -我剛剛說了
- I want your advice. - I just gave you my advice.

274
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,130
你只是說你會怎么做
No, you told me what you would do.

275
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,010
我想知道你覺得我該怎么做
I want to know what you think I should do.

276
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,750
邁克  上周你還說你愿不惜一切
Mike, last week, you said you'd do anything

277
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,350
不再做個騙子  所以我建議你接受
to stop being a fraud, so my advice is take it.

278
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,990
還是大聯盟  只是不同的賽事
Still be in the majors, just be a different sport.

279
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,580
打擾  你有空嗎
Excuse me, do you have a minute?

280
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,710
我們兩人向來不...
Look, you and I have never--

281
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,220
沒錯  的確
No, we haven't.

282
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,810
我需要你幫助
I need your help.

283
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,640
你來找我的話
You must be scraping the bottom of the barrel

284
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,100
-一定是走投無路了  -是關于路易
- if you're coming to me. - It's about Louis.

285
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,060
-他和希拉沒戲了  -太糟了
- He and Sheila are done. - That's awful.

286
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,760
比那還糟
It's worse than awful.

287
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,660
杰西卡需要他現在負責一樁案子
Jessica needs him on a case right now.

288
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,130
而他不肯出門  甚至不接電話
He won't leave his apartment. He won't even answer his phone.

289
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,250
那我現在過去一趟
Then I'll just go over there right now.

290
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,560
沒用的
That won't work.

291
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,340
即使好使了  也來不及
Even if it did, we don't have time.

292
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,070
那你來干什么
So then why are you here?

293
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,830
瑞秋  你不信任我
Rachel, you don't trust me.

294
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,080
這我懂  但路易讓我替他應付好
I get that, but Louis asked me to cover for him,

295
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,540
所以我就要這么做
and that is what I'm going to do.

296
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,980
你是這兒最棒的律師助理
You're the best paralegal here,

297
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,030
也是他的朋友
and you're his friend.

298
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,630
-幫不幫忙  -幫
- So will you help me or not? - I will.

299
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,750
我知道你今晚能做什么來彌補我了
So...I figured out what you can do to make it up to me tonight.

300
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,590
我以為我們之間沒事了
I thought we were good.

301
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,050
對  只是  我覺得還有些余怒未消
Yeah, I'm just--I'm feeling some residual anger.

302
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,940
斯科特  我現在有點忙
Scottie, I'm kind of busy right now,

303
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,180
而且晚上有事情
and I have plans tonight.

304
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,930
帶邁克去另一場公開募股約會嗎
Taking Mike on another I.P.O. date?

305
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,890
-有什么區別  -聽起來夠神秘
- What difference does it make? - Sounds mysterious.

306
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,490
我打賭你不能說是什么事
Bet you can't tell me what it is.

307
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,130
-我要去玩牌  -玩牌嗎
- I'm playing poker. - Poker?

308
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,090
-我能來嗎  -工作上的事
- Can I come? - It's a work thing.

309
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,210
你帶邁克去干工作上的事
You bring Mike to work things.

310
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,090
斯科特  告訴過你我很忙  你不能來
Scottie, I told you I'm busy. You can't come.

311
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,600
我能繼續工作了嗎
Can I get back to work now?

312
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,160
-你吃錯什么藥了  -沒有
- What got into you? - Nothing.

313
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,510
只是有時候當我在辦公室  我是在辦公
Sometimes at the office, I'm working.

314
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,260
算你有理  老板
Fair enough, boss.

315
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,140
你確定要這么玩嗎
Are you sure that's how you want to play that?

316
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,060
玩什么  我很忙的事實嗎
Play what, the fact that I'm busy?

317
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,510
這么個事實  你對著她發作
The fact that you just snapped at her

318
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,410
但我們都知道  你到底為什么發火
when we both know what you're really angry about.

319
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,290
我沒發火  我只是很煩被打斷
I'm not angry. I'm annoyed at the interruption.

320
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,200
你發火  因為邁克想離開
You're angry that Mike wants to leave,

321
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,740
你卻遷怒在她身上
and you just took it out on her.

322
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,280
-我沒為那件事發火  -對  但你受傷了
- I'm not angry about that. - No, you're hurt,

323
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,040
用憤怒掩飾傷心  但我知道你自己并不清楚
and the anger covers the hurt, but I knew you didn't know that.

324
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,860
我只是很煩被打斷
I was annoyed about the interruption

325
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,080
-我現在也很煩  一個道理  -胡說
- just like I'm annoyed right now. - Bullshit.

326
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,250
我跟你感同身受
You're feeling exactly what I'm feeling.

327
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,290
邁克離開的消息是讓人不好受
The idea of Mike leaving sucks,

328
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,230
你越早繞開這個情緒
and the sooner you get your brain around that,

329
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,600
就能越早采取措施
the sooner you can maybe do something about it.

330
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,050
我能繼續工作了嗎
Can I get back to work now?

331
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,650
隨時都可以
You can get back to work whenever you want.

332
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,050
但如果你只想埋著頭逃避問題
But if all you're gonna do is stick your head in the sand,

333
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,830
那可就連打斷你工作的
then you're not going to have

334
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,620
初級律師或者女朋友都沒有了
an associate or a girlfriend to get back to work from.

335
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,110
-你給她了嗎  -給她了
- You give it to her? - I gave it to her.

336
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,460
她有什么懷疑嗎
She suspect anything?

337
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,020
如果她懷疑了  我就不會站在這兒了
I wouldn't be standing here if she did.

338
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,620
-然后  -她覺得非常棒
- And? - She thought it was awesome.

339
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,870
那是當然
Well, she should.

340
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,790
路易不僅想出來了個好辦法
Louis didn't just come up with a way

341
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,930
保證查爾斯·范·戴克查不了我們的賬
to keep Charles Van Dyke out of our books.

342
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,530
還把他整得一敗涂地
Louis came up with a way to blow him out of the water.

343
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,950
那個路易  真是個厲害的律師
That Louis. He is one hell of an attorney.

344
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,790
-謝謝你  路易  -稍后見  路易
- Thank you, Louis. - Right back at you, Louis.

345
00:14:48,000 --> 00:15:48,000
人人影視
YYeTs.com

346
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,470
-別太習慣了  -別擔心
- Don't get used to it. - Don't worry.

347
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,410
我沒打算重新在這兒工作
I'm not looking to work here again.

348
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,290
雖然不在這兒  但你是在找工作
Not here, but you are looking to work?

349
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,000
我總能一眼看穿你的鬼話的  查爾斯
I've always been able to see through your bullshit, Charles.

350
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,530
所以我才給你提供這些
Which is why I'm offering you these,

351
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,190
一共五個案子
five cases.

352
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,330
我們合伙  利潤對半分
We're co-counsel, split the profits 50/50.

353
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,020
可以向全世界宣布  你重出江湖
It announces to the world that you are back in business,

354
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,470
這才是你真正想要的
which is what you really want.

355
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,620
你帶著禮物來找我
You came to me bearing gifts.

356
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,610
我還留著當初的卡片
I still have the card.

357
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,480
"致我的雇主  感謝你所做的一切"
"To the man who hired me for all you've done."

358
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,630
兩天后  你把我撇到了一邊
Two days later, you shoved me out.

359
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,600
我就當你不打算接受我的提議
I take this to mean you're passing on my offer.

360
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,290
我這是把你的提議踩在腳下
I'm shiting on your offer.

361
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,100
好吧查爾斯  你說的沒錯
Okay, Charles. You were right.

362
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,620
你的股利分紅確實數額不對
Your dividend check did have the wrong amount,

363
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,960
但從今往后  數額就會變正確了
But from now on, it's going to have the right amount,

364
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,150
那就是零
zero.

365
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,220
我可不這么認為
I don't think so.

366
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,440
你手握退出協定的律所  已經不復存在了
oh, the firm you had your exit agreement with no longer exists.

367
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,390
我們變成了皮爾遜-達比
We became Pearson Darby,

368
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,880
后來是皮爾遜-斯佩克特
then Pearson Specter,

369
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,860
你一點資格都沒有
which means you're not entitled to a thing.

370
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,160
我們的協議精神可不是這么說的
That's not in the spirit of our agreement.

371
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,780
你的聲明也沒這么說
And neither is your claim.

372
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,610
只有一個問題
There's only one problem.

373
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,120
你看附屬細則的時候真該更仔細點
You should have dug deeper into the fine print.

374
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,140
根據你的細則
The entity referred to in our agreement

375
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,340
我們協議中提到的內容可解釋為
is defined in your bylaws as

376
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,110
"任何以杰西卡·皮爾遜
"Any partnership in which

377
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,190
為冠名的合伙人關系"
the name partner is Jessica Pearson."

378
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,530
你居然不知道
You didn't know.

379
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,740
我的數字剛剛乘以三了
My number just tripled.

380
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,450
由你決定
Your call.

381
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,520
我們的聽證會在禮拜五
Our hearing is friday.

382
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,650
你們在玩牌嗎
You guys playing cards?

383
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,120
你別自不量力  這是給真正的玩家玩的
You're out of your league. This game is for real players.

384
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,360
不試試怎么知道
Why don't I give it a try?

385
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,370
門檻費兩萬五
Buy-in is 25,000.

386
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,720
-上限是什么  -沒有上限
- What's the limit? - There is no limit.

387
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,780
大概我是在自不量力
Maybe I am out of my league.

388
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,390
加注四萬五
Raise $45,000.

389
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,360
你可得全押了
I'm putting you all-in.

390
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,280
我見過你這樣的
I've seen guys like you before.

391
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,890
你以為大賭注可以壓得住我
You think if you bully me with your big stack,

392
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,210
我會臨陣畏縮
I'm gonna run and hide.

393
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,070
這就是我和你的不同了  吉姆
Here's the difference between you and me, Jimbo,

394
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,980
我輸了  就再出兩萬五
I lose, I pull out another 25 grand,

395
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,670
然后再出兩萬五
and another 25 after that.

396
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,690
你輸了  就一無所有了
You lose, you've got nothing.

397
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,110
你在虛張聲勢
You're bluffing.

398
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,620
要么跟注  要么起身走人
Then call or get up and walk away,

399
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,000
但我和你面對面太多次了
But I've sat across from you 1,000 times before.

400
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,660
你不會走的
You won't walk.

401
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,710
艱難獲勝
Tough beat.

402
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,430
拿走你的戰利品吧
Take your winnings.

403
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,870
什么戰利品
What winnings?

404
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,990
我覺得也許我倆能來點討價還價
I thought maybe it was time we do a little negotiating.

405
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,180
-你知道我的出價了  -我有加價
- Well, you have my offer. - I have a counter.

406
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,490
-洗耳恭聽  -我希望基本工資提高50%
- I'm all ears. - I want a 50% increase in base salary.

407
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,570
保證分紅不與投資收益掛鉤
I want a guaranteed bonus not tied to our investment returns,

408
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,870
四周年假  我還要入股
A four-week vacation, and I want a piece.

409
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,120
-入股嗎  -對
- A piece? - A piece.

410
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,230
-不行  -不能入股嗎
- No. - No piece?

411
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,660
不能討價還價  我知道在想什么
No negotiating. Look, I know what you're doing.

412
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,990
你下不了決心
You can't make up your mind,

413
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,630
所以希望我來替你做決定
So you want me to make it up for you.

414
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,910
但我不希望人們為了錢而跟著我
But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.

415
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,250
我希望跟著我的人
I want someone who's with me

416
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,770
是因為想變得厲害才入這行
'cause they want to kick some ass.

417
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,580
我確實挺厲害
I do kick ass.

418
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,420
如果你現在就接受這份工作
And if you want to take this job right now,

419
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,370
我就認認真真跟你商討
I will negotiate in good faith.

420
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,360
但你不想
But you don't.

421
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,450
現在還不想
I don't yet.

422
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,770
明天起
Starting tomorrow,

423
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,830
我會開始面試其他人
I'll be interviewing other people.

424
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,780
一旦我找到合適的人選
Once I find the right person,

425
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,530
這工作就沒了
job is gone.

426
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,270
我不會在你們上市的兩天前撤訴的
I'm not dropping my suit when you're going public in two days.

427
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,050
詹姆斯  你肯定讀過海辛頓石油的相關報道
James, you've read all about Hessington Oil.

428
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,690
當時的情形完全不利于我
The odds were stacked against me.

429
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,290
我還是贏了  因為我生來就是贏家
I won anyway, because I win.

430
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,190
你贏了  是因為愛德華·達比出了頭
You won because Edward Darby came forward.

431
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,270
你碰運氣而已
You got lucky.

432
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,280
像你這樣的人  總是覺得別人是碰運氣
Guys like you always think other people get lucky.

433
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,690
我不碰運氣
I don't get lucky.

434
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,620
我創造自己的運氣
I make my own luck,

435
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,990
這個案子  你會一敗涂地
And in this case, it's bleeding you dry.

436
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:48,000
人人影視
YYeTs.com

437
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,580
就在剛剛
Right there.

438
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,360
你泄了底  你沒錢了
You just gave me your tell. You have no other money.

439
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:58,720
你玩完了  那堆牌注里有十萬美元
You're done. There's $100,000 in that pile.

440
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,600
正好是我們給你提的價
It's the exact amount of the deal we offered you.

441
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,600
簽了它
Sign it.

442
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,250
我們明天再完成文件
We'll fix the paperwork tomorrow.

443
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,840
這是一千美金  幫我兌現
This is $1,000. Cash me out.

444
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,540
他今晚不再玩了
He doesn't play anymore the rest of the night.

445
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,550
你沒睡好
You didn't sleep well.

446
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,240
我根本沒睡
I didn't sleep at all.

447
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,390
這確實是個重大決定
It's a big decision.

448
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,170
你到現在也沒說過你的想法
You still haven't told me what you think.

449
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,450
邁克  我不能幫你做決定
Mike, I can't make the decision for you.

450
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,450
我沒想讓你幫我做決定
I don't want you to make it for me.

451
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,730
我只想知道你的看法
I just want to know what you think.

452
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,600
我已經跟你說過我會
And I already told you that I will support you

453
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,830
-支持你的所有決定  -你表示支持的
- with whatever you decide.  - And the way you can support me

454
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,580
方法就是告訴我你的看法
right now is by telling me how you feel.

455
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,810
-這不應該由我說  -不應該由你說
- It's not my place. - Not your place?

456
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,430
承認吧  你想讓我接受那份工作
Just admit it. You want me to take the job,

457
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,770
但你不敢說
but you're too afraid to say it.

458
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,090
好吧  你想聽實話嗎
Okay, you want to know the truth?

459
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,500
你早就知道自己想怎么做了
You already know what you want to do.

460
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,130
如果我還試圖改變你的想法并且以后出了錯
And if I try to change your mind and it goes wrong,

461
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,170
我很害怕你會在這事上做文章
then I'm afraid you're gonna hold it against me.

462
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,170
你就說吧
Would you just say it?

463
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,800
是的  我希望你接受那份工作
Yes. I want you to take the job.

464
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,790
我知道你很熱愛現在的工作
Look, I know that you love what you do,

465
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,430
但你每天都要帶著被抓的可能性
but every day, you go into work with the possibility

466
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,830
去上班  這件事在一點點的吞噬著你
of being caught, and it is eating away at you.

467
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,960
如果你留在這  這個情況永遠不會改變
If you stay there, that's just not gonna change.

468
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,190
-杰西卡  事情進展  -如何
- Jessica. How did-- - It go?

469
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,510
我來告訴你進展如何  我被害慘了
I'll tell you how it went. I got hung out to dry.

470
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,960
什么  不可能  那辦法很高明
What? No, it was a good move.

471
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,150
如果不是我們自己的章程
Oh, it would have been

472
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,400
推翻了這個辦法的話  那確實高明
if our own bylaws didn't supersede it.

473
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,060
那不可能
Th-that's impossible.

474
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,390
關鍵信息被隱藏在復雜難懂的小字注釋中了
It was convoluted and buried in the fine print,

475
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,080
如果是路易·利特的話一定會想到
and something Louis Litt never would have missed.

476
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,780
看著我的眼睛說我說錯了嗎
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.

477
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,490
你說的沒錯  他一定能想到
You're not. He wouldn't have missed it.

478
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,430
所以當你走進我的辦公室
So when you came into my office

479
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,680
告訴我路易想出了這個辦法的時候
and told me Louis had come up with that move,

480
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,120
你就是在蒙我
you were full of shit.

481
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,720
對不起  我只是想幫忙
I'm sorry. I wanted to help.

482
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,430
這種事只會發生這一次
Well, that kind of thing only happens once.

483
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,820
你知道我為什么這么說嗎
You know how I know it's not gonna happen again?

484
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,880
收拾好你的東西
Pack up your shit.

485
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,280
我不在乎你和哈維有什么協議
I don't care what kind of deal you have with Harvey.

486
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,190
你可以走了
You're done.

487
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,010
你為什么不告訴她
Why wouldn't you tell her?

488
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,210
我說了我會幫他打掩護
I said I would cover.

489
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,820
我沒說只有在情況允許的條件下才幫他
I didn't say I would cover when it suited me.

490
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,460
是的  但他也不想你因為這件事被開除啊
Yeah, but he wouldn't want you to get fired over this.

491
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,290
我應該被開除  我讓杰西卡出丑
I should be fired. I let Jessica look stupid.

492
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,230
卡特里娜
Katrina--

493
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,050
謝謝你幫我  瑞秋
Thank you for your help, Rachel.

494
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,280
我很感激
I really appreciate it,

495
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,340
但如果你不介意的話  我想一個人呆著
but if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone.

496
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,030
他不在
He's not here.

497
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,950
去哪兒了
Where is he?

498
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,430
說實話  我不知道
To tell you the truth, I don't know.

499
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,020
他只說他昨晚睡得很晚
All he said was he had a late night.

500
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,150
好吧  我等下再來
Well, I can come back.

501
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,230
-我只是  -你準備接受那份工作了
- I was just--  - You're taking the job,

502
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,210
是不是
Aren't you?

503
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,100
我不知道
I don't know.

504
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,990
你知道
Yeah, you do.

505
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,510
你只是不想承認而已
You just don't want to admit it.

506
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,780
是的  我準備接受那份工作了
Yeah. I'm taking the job.

507
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,010
該死的
God damn it.

508
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,800
你知道那個人都為你做了些什么嗎
Do you know what that man has done for you?

509
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,070
你知道他費了多少力才開始信任別人嗎
Do you know what it took for him to start trusting someone?

510
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,510
-唐娜  -別打斷我
- Donna-- - Don't interrupt me.

511
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,290
有個人在你面前甩下些錢
So someone's dangling some money in front of you.

512
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,190
-跟錢沒關系  -我不在乎跟什么有關
- It's not about that. - I don't care what it's about.

513
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,130
我要把他不愿說的話告訴你
I'm gonna say what he won't.

514
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,170
他需要你
He needs you.

515
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,690
你需要這份工作  如果你不明白這點
You need this job, and if you can't see that,

516
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,990
也許你確實應該離開
then you might as well just leave right now.

517
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,090
唐娜  有人為我找到了一條出路
Donna, someone's offering me a way out.

518
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,700
-那你不在乎他嗎  -我當然在乎
- So you don't care about him. - Of course I do,

519
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,050
但我也在乎和瑞秋一起的生活
but I also care about my life with Rachel.

520
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,890
我不想在過這樣的生活了
I don't want to live my life like this anymore.

521
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,810
那你最好成為這個城市里
Then you better be the best goddamn investment banker

522
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,070
最好的投資銀行家
this city has ever seen.

523
00:24:48,000 --> 00:25:48,000
人人影視
YYeTs.com

524
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,150
斯科特  很抱歉我對你發脾氣了
Scottie, I'm sorry I was angry in your direction,

525
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,900
但我發火是因為別的事情
but it was really about something else.

526
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,130
我猜猜  唐娜把你的感受告訴你了
Let me guess, Donna explained your feelings to you,

527
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,790
現在你來跟我道歉了
and now you're here to apologize.

528
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,920
也許吧
Maybe.

529
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,470
別的事情到底是什么事
What was the something else?

530
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,710
有人給了邁克一個工作機會
Mike got a job offer.

531
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,310
但你不想讓他走
And you don't want him to do it.

532
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,470
我不想
No, I don't.

533
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,940
如果你想讓他留下來
well, if you want him to stay,

534
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,570
你知道該怎樣做嗎
you know what's actually a nice tactic?

535
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,370
告訴他你想讓他留下來
Telling him you want him to stay.

536
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,250
什么
What?

537
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,740
我不知道"告訴我你到底發生了什么事"
Had I known "Tell me what's going on with you"

538
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,470
原來等于"我會告訴你應該怎么做"
meant "I'm going to tell you what to do,"

539
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,980
知道的話我就不來找你了
I might not have taken you up on it.

540
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,040
好吧
Oh, okay. Mmm.

541
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,190
-你先進去吧  -好吧
- I'll see you in there. - Okay.

542
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,160
文件帶來了嗎
You have that paperwork for me?

543
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,570
我確實有東西給你  但不是你要的文件
Well, I got something for you, but it's not that.

544
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,480
經過昨晚你還沒有長記性嗎
Didn't you learn your lesson last night?

545
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,770
我學會了傾聽
I learned to listen.

546
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,940
你說話的時候
When you talked,

547
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,780
提到了海辛頓石油  我就去查了一下
you mentioned Hessington Oil, so I looked back into it.

548
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,510
結果發現你并不是自己制造運氣
Turns out you don't create your own luck.

549
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,760
是你的手下替你制造的
Your associate does.

550
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,030
你這么說是什么意思
What the hell are you talking about?

551
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,900
他與哈羅德·甘德森合謀
He conspired with Harold Gunderson

552
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,940
對你們自己的客戶發起了訴訟
to file a lawsuit against your own client

553
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,390
好讓你去賄賂證人不出庭作證
so you could bribe witnesses not to testify.

554
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,810
我們沒有賄賂任何人
We didn't bribe anyone.

555
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,300
-那是合法的訴訟和解  -別跟我說
- That was a legal settlement. - Don't try to tell me

556
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,450
兩個一起上法學院  畢業后一同工作的
two rookie associates who went to law school together

557
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,480
新手律師沒有共謀
and started at the same firm made this happen

558
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,990
-促成了此事  -我不用告訴你任何事
- without collusion. - I don't need to tell you

559
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,870
因為根本沒什么好說的
anything 'cause there's nothing to tell.

560
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,170
你肯定和什么人說了些什么
Well, you're gonna have to tell someone something,

561
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,720
因為那案子頭一天發起  第二天就和解
because that suit was filed one day, settled the next,

562
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,990
那些證人也取消了去紐約的機票
and those witnesses cancelled their flights to New York.

563
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,270
那就是賄賂
That is a bribe,

564
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,210
當我把這件事告訴律師協會后
And when I bring it to the attention of the bar,

565
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,310
你和你的手下就慘了
you and your associate are going to be in deep shit.

566
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,240
現在看看是誰泄底了
Now who showed his tell?

567
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,690
你的錢還給你
Here's your money back.

568
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,010
我去律師協會告發你  或者兩百萬和解
And either I go to the bar, or you settle for $2 million.

569
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,510
明天之前答復我
You have until tomorrow.

570
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,340
-邁克在哪  -在里面
- Where is Mike? - He's in there.

571
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,410
哈維
Harvey--

572
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,130
-哈維  -等一下
- Harvey. - Not now.

573
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,910
-打電話給羅拉·詹森  -什么
- You need to call Lola Jensen. - What?

574
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,610
你要讓她黑進律師協會
You need to get her to hack into the bar

575
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,400
然后把你的名字加進去
and put your name in.

576
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,560
你在說什么
What the hell are you talking about?

577
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,380
一周前  你告訴我首要的原則是
A week ago, you told me that the number one rule

578
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,930
不要有任何行動
was not to move the goddamn body.

579
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,020
一周前  沒有人在打探你
A week ago, people weren't sniffing around you.

580
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,760
-哈維  那份工作  -這與那份工作無關
- Harvey, my job offer is not-- - This isn't about your offer.

581
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,600
柯靈知道了你與哈羅德·甘德森
Quelling knows about your bullshit lawsuit

582
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,900
那個狗屁官司了
with Harold Gunderson.

583
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,410
他去檢舉我了
He turned me in?

584
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,760
沒有  但如果我們不屈服他會的
No, but he will if we don't cave.

585
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,180
-他什么都證明不了  -他不用證明
- He can't prove anything. - He doesn't have to.

586
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,090
他把你交給律師協會
He hands you in to the bar,

587
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,490
他們查一下你的名字  我們就完了
they look you up, we're done.

588
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,590
我離開這里就沒事了
Not if I'm not here.

589
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,120
你來就是為了說這事
Oh, that's why you're in here.

590
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,530
-你打算接受那份工作  -是
- You're taking the job. - I am.

591
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,570
你以為只要你不在這里工作
And you think an addicted gambler

592
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,660
那個失去了老婆孩子和房子的賭棍
who lost his wife, his child, and his house is gonna stop

593
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,740
就會不再糾纏你了嗎
coming for you just because you're not working here?

594
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,770
你自己也說過  黑進資格考名單
You said it yourself. Hacking into the bar

595
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,250
比我現在犯的罪還重一倍
is twice the crime I've been committing.

596
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,440
我告訴你  柯靈正在受審
I am telling you Quelling is on the trail.

597
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,890
如果你不這么做  我們就會被抓住
You don't do this, we're gonna get caught.

598
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,420
-一定有其它辦法的  -沒有
- There's got to be another way. - There isn't.

599
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,490
-我不信  -那你最好
- I don't believe that. - Then you better

600
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,920
趕緊想個主意出來  不然明早
figure something out fast, because tomorrow morning,

601
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,910
我們就完了  就算你辭職也無濟于事
we're done, and you quitting isn't gonna change that.

602
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,440
立刻來見我  J

603
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,380
你不能解雇卡特里娜·班尼特
You can't fire Katrina Bennett.

604
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,600
我可以解雇任何想解雇的人
I can fire whoever I want to.

605
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,100
她是在為路易掩飾
She was covering for Louis.

606
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,940
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

607
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,610
路易的訂婚無疾而終了  他很消沉
Louis's engagement is over, and he's losing it.

608
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,190
他不來工作  不接電話
He won't come in to work, he won't pick up his phone,

609
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,120
而且不想讓任何人知道
and he just didn't want anyone to know.

610
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,090
那為什么是你來告訴我
Then why are you telling me?

611
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,330
因為我幫著她一起為路易掩飾了
Because I helped her cover for him.

612
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,030
你是想說我該把你也炒了嗎
Are you saying I should fire you too?

613
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,850
我是想說
I am saying that...

614
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,690
我們是做錯了
we made a mistake,

615
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,980
但我們也是為了路易
but that we were just looking out for Louis,

616
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,440
而我知道你有多看重忠誠
and I know how much you value loyalty,

617
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,480
所以我覺得卡特里娜
so I don't think that should be the thing

618
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,140
不該為此丟了工作
that costs Katrina her job...

619
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,390
我也是
or mine.

620
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,920
-杰西卡  -我需要你
- Jessica. - I need you.

621
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,830
不  聽著  我需要一點時間
No, listen, I just need a little more time.

622
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,160
那你只要跟我開口  我會同意的
And had you asked me for it, I would have said yes,

623
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,620
可相反  你卻讓卡特里娜為你掩飾
but instead, you had Katrina cover for you.

624
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,790
那個小叛徒  她把我供出來了嗎
Oh, that little traitor. What, did she rat me out?

625
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,990
沒有  她對你很忠誠
No, she didn't. She's so loyal to you

626
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,760
甚至想頂替你做了你的工作
that she tried to pass off her work for yours.

627
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,140
路易  范·戴克想看我們的賬本
Louis, Van Dyke wants to look at our books.

628
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,260
什么  不能讓他這么做
What? We can't have that.

629
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,850
我知道  這是她的應對方案
I know. This was her fix.

630
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,270
哦不  你用了這個來對付他
Oh, no, and you used this on him?

631
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,120
對  所以我解雇了卡特里娜
I did, and then I fired Katrina.

632
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,610
-杰西卡  -我知道
- Jessica. - I know.

633
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,560
我不能因為她的忠誠而解雇她
I can't fire her for being loyal.

634
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,970
但現在已經火燒眉毛了  沒時間讓你
But I can't afford you sitting here licking your wounds

635
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,950
坐在這舔舐傷口
while I get my ass handed to me.

636
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,250
拜托  聽我說幾句  好嗎
Please, just listen to me, okay?

637
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,970
我現在無法明辨
I cannot see straight.

638
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,000
無法思考
I cannot think straight,

639
00:29:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
人人影視
YYeTs.com

640
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,500
即使我想幫你
and even if I wanted to come and help you,

641
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,120
我也毫無用處  所以...
I wouldn't be any good to you, so...

642
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,860
路易
Louis...

643
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,280
我知道你愛過希拉
I know you loved Sheila,

644
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,200
可你愛你的律所嗎
but do you love your firm?

645
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,530
你知道我愛的
You know I do.

646
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,540
當你愛上一個女人時
And when you love a woman,

647
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,940
想到她和別人在一起  你能忍受嗎
can you stand the thought of her being with another man?

648
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,950
-不  -那么  路易
- No. - Well, Louis,

649
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:19,410
范·戴克正在試圖扒了皮爾遜-斯佩克特的褲子
Van Dyke is trying to get into Pearson Specter's pants.

650
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,150
你要怎么做
What are you going to do about it?

651
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,360
我要牢牢系上貞操帶
I'm gonna put on a goddamn chastity belt.

652
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,280
怎么系
How?

653
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,540
卡特里娜的方向其實是對的
'Cause Katrina actually was on the right track.

654
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,380
只要取消合伙制度  他的要求就可以去見鬼了
Van Dyke's claim is gone if the partnership is gone.

655
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,410
公司章程可不是這么說的
The bylaws say it's not.

656
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,630
不  只要我們變成有限責任公司就行了
No, it is if we become an l.L.C.

657
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,240
但在明天之前是做不到的
We can't do that by tomorrow.

658
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,570
我們得重新起草每一份合同
We'd have to rewrite every contract.

659
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,800
杰西卡  你有時候真讓我服了
Boy, wow, Jessica, you sometimes really surprise me.

660
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,200
你以為我不知道這點嗎
You don't think I know that?

661
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,080
我的助理律師部隊
I have an army of associates that I've trained

662
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,450
曾被我精心調教得死去活來
within an inch of their lives.

663
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,900
我可是鬼見愁路易·馬洛·利特
My name is Louis goddamn Marlowe Litt,

664
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,800
現在我的律所被圍攻了  所以你別來告訴我
and my firm is under siege, so don't you tell me

665
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,410
什么能做什么不能做
what I can and cannot do!

666
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,980
我不想打擾你  就是有點好奇
I don't want to interrupt, but I was just wondering

667
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,370
邁克怎么了
what happened with Mike.

668
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,900
他要辭職
He's leaving.

669
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,670
真遺憾
I'm sorry.

670
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,370
沒事
It's fine.

671
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,630
能問你點事嗎
Can I ask you something?

672
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,710
你有沒有告訴他  你希望他留下
Did you tell him that you wanted him to stay?

673
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,510
我沒機會說
I didn't get around to it.

674
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,330
你沒機會說
You--you didn't get around to it?

675
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,670
我正打算說  他就告訴我他要走
I was gonna tell him, and then he told me he was leaving,

676
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,510
之后又發生了一堆破事  所以
and then other shit came up, so...

677
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,190
所以你就放棄了
So you just dropped it?

678
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,080
我說了  發生了別的破事
I told you other shit came up.

679
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,960
什么破事
What other shit?

680
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,120
難道你突然來了個案子
I mean, you had an emergency case filing,

681
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,980
所以就讓你徒弟這么走了
so you let your protege walk out the door?

682
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,700
-事情很復雜  -好吧
- It's complicated. - Okay.

683
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,400
那就跟我說說
Well, then share it with me.

684
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,580
柯靈纏上我們了  因為海辛頓案的目擊者
Quelling came after us. The Hessington witnesses.

685
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,190
什么  真是扯淡
What? That's bullshit.

686
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,180
或許你是鉆了點法律的空子
You may have blurred some lines,

687
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,350
但你絕對沒有越界違法
but you certainly didn't cross any.

688
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,470
反擊他
Fight him.

689
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,280
-我不能  -為什么
- No, I can't. - why?

690
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,030
我不想談這個
Look, I don't want to talk about it.

691
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,720
怎么回事  如果有人激怒你
What is going on here? When somebody pisses you off,

692
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,360
-你只會打得他屁滾尿流  -你想說什么
- you get in the ring. - What are you saying?

693
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,720
我想說你不僅沒有反擊柯靈
What I'm saying is that you're not taking on Quelling,

694
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,240
反而還讓邁克走了
but you're letting Mike walk out the door

695
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,150
甚至沒有試圖阻攔他
without trying to stop him.

696
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,640
肯定是有什么變了
I think one thing changed the other,

697
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,870
我想知道原因
and I want to know why.

698
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,680
或許是他變了  不愿留在這了
Maybe what changed is his desire to be here,

699
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,790
或許我要說的根本不重要
and maybe what I have to say doesn't matter.

700
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,320
那很重要  到底是什么事
Of course it matters. Now, what is this really about?

701
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,120
肯定跟什么破案子無關
Because it's sure as hell not about some stupid case.

702
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,680
去他媽的無關
You know what? God damn it!

703
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,330
我說是什么事就是什么事  不行嗎
For once, can't it just be about what I said it's about?

704
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,560
你根本沒說過是什么事
You didn't say what it was about.

705
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,920
哈維  我真的很遺憾
Harvey, I'm really sorry

706
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,180
邁克的事結果變成這樣
that the Mike thing turned out this way.

707
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,260
真的  但我得說我猜到了會這樣
I am, but I can't say that I didn't see it coming.

708
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,750
-斯科特  這不是  -什么  不是什么
- Scottie, it isn't-- - What? It isn't what?

709
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,010
不是表面上看起來那樣
It isn't what it seems?

710
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,360
我都不知道表面上看起來什么樣
Because I don't know what it seems.

711
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,350
我只知道每次我問你什么事
All I know is that any time I ask you about anything,

712
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,880
你都只會告訴我你不能說
all you say is, "I can't talk about it."

713
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,820
所以我不會再問了
I'm just gonna stop asking.

714
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,640
反正之后我們會和好
Then we'll just make up later,

715
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,610
然后明天同樣的事又會再次上演
and we can do it all over again tomorrow.

716
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,870
柯靈對我們沒威脅了
Quelling can't hurt us anymore.

717
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,490
-你去見羅拉了  -我查了他的賬戶
- You went to see Lola. - I looked at his accounts.

718
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,720
我想查出他哪來的錢
I wanted to find out where all that money came from

719
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,330
去找來這么多委托人
to find all those clients.

720
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,270
他沒錢
He doesn't have the money.

721
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,480
可他卻付清了房租
And yet his rent gets paid,

722
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,440
也沒被斷電
and they don't turn off his electricity.

723
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,580
我了個去
Holy shit.

724
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,380
看來你不用去見羅拉了
Guess you didn't have to see Lola after all.

725
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,700
你以為我是靠法院指令進他賬戶的嗎
You think I got access to that with a court order?

726
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,670
所以你還是去見羅拉了
So you did go see her?

727
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,040
是你的主意
You put the idea in my head.

728
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,740
我不過改了改具體內容
I just came up with a different agenda.

729
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,850
我們解決他了
We got him.

730
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,520
不
No.

731
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,810
-是你解決了  -什么
- You got him. - What?

732
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,560
算你的餞別禮
Your going-away present.

733
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,680
最后當一把律師  給他點教訓
Be a lawyer one last time. Knock this guy out.

734
00:34:48,000 --> 00:35:48,000
人人影視
YYeTs.com

735
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,240
你帶支票來了嗎
You have my settlement check.

736
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,450
一分錢都沒有
I don't have a dime for you.

737
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,280
那我明天得一早就要去委員會
Then I guess the bar is going to be hearing from me

738
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,300
打個報告了
first thing in the morning.

739
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,030
那我也會去
Well, then, they'll also be hearing from me.

740
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,980
準則第5-107條A款  "接受..."
Disciplinary rule 5-107a, "Accepting compensation--"

741
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,860
我知道條款內容
I know what it says.

742
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,200
那你也知道懲罰是剝奪律師資格
Then you also know The penalty is being disbarred.

743
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,480
你收了我方客戶競爭對手的錢
You took money from our client's competitors

744
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,930
捏造了案子
to trump up your bullshit suit.

745
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,310
你這消息不是合法獲得的吧
You didn't come by that legally.

746
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,100
委員會才不關心呢
And they're not gonna care.

747
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,330
不知道你是否注意到
I don't know if you've noticed,

748
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,110
但我了無牽掛
but I don't have a hell of a lot to lose,

749
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,090
要么簽協議  要么就滾出去
so sign my deal or get the hell out of my office.

750
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,460
不過事實是  詹姆斯
Well, here's the thing, James.

751
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,660
我也是
I don't either...

752
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,020
因為今天是我最后一天做律師
Because today is my last day as a lawyer anyway.

753
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,210
-你就忽悠吧  -看著我
- Bullshit. - Look at me.

754
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,270
祝你去委員會好運
Good luck in front of the bar.

755
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,860
我并非一直如此
I wasn't always like this.

756
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,860
煙草公司一案勝利近在咫尺
I had tobacco in my sights.

757
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,600
他們愿意出很多錢
They offered me a lot of money.

758
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,080
我本可以大賺一筆
I could have made a fortune.

759
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,570
但就給患有癌癥的人一人一萬五
But $15,000 per client for people with cancer?

760
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,610
我冒險等判決  因為我想
I risked going to verdict because I wanted to

761
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,660
為那些人拿到更多錢  能讓生活有所不同
get those people something that could make a difference!

762
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,150
結果我失去了一切
And I lost everything...

763
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,990
客戶  妻子  孩子
My clients, my wife, my kids!

764
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,220
你失去他們是因為你的賭癮  詹姆斯
You lost them because you gambled them away, James.

765
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,450
我知道
I know that.

766
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
求你了
Please.

767
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,450
我生來就是律師
Being a lawyer is what I am.

768
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,890
是我的生命
It's who I am.

769
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,150
若你奪走...
And if you take that away...

770
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,670
決定權在你  詹姆斯
It's up to you, James.

771
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,230
我會撤銷訴訟
I'll drop the suit.

772
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,160
我保證
I promise.

773
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,250
路易  你在哪呢
Louis, where the hell are you?

774
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,820
你說你做得到
You said you could get it done.

775
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,970
我要是走進去  就都晚了
I walk through those doors, our books fly open.

776
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,330
趕緊過來
Get here now.

777
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,340
這回肯定很帶勁
Well, this should be fun.

778
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,490
我們還沒來沒做過對手
We've never been across the aisle from each other.

779
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,910
所以你才不知道我的厲害
Which is why you don't realize that it won't be fun.

780
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,240
我們走著瞧
We'll see what we see.

781
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,110
第41432號案件  范·戴克訴皮爾遜
Case 41432, Van Dyke versus Pearson.

782
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,990
瞧  游戲開始
Look at that. Game time.

783
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,350
-女士優先  -女士優先
- Ladies first. - Ladies first.

784
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,230
-狗娘養的  -禮貌也有錯
- Son of a bitch. - For being polite?

785
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,170
你當初雇傭我時  是出于禮節嗎
Were you being polite when you hired me?

786
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,270
這跟現在又有什么關系
What does one have to do with the other?

787
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,560
致錄取我的人  感謝你所做的一切
"To the man who hired me, for all you've done."

788
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,150
你想知道我寫那張卡是為了什么嗎
Do you want to know what I meant when I wrote that card?

789
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,810
你同意雇傭我時  我問過你
The day you made me that offer, I asked you,

790
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,710
這跟性別或種族有沒有關系
"Did it have anything to do with gender or race?"

791
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,790
你發誓說沒有
You swore it didn't.

792
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,990
你騙了我
You lied to me.

793
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,360
-是沒有  -你現在還在撒謊
- It didn't. - You're lying now.

794
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,060
丹尼爾·哈德曼雖會利用別人
You know, Daniel Hardman may have used people,

795
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,140
但他從不關心性別
but he didn't give a shit about their gender

796
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,200
或膚色
or their color.

797
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,470
他給你看了名單
He showed you the list.

798
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:41,250
在我名字旁有個星號  不是說我突出
Right next to my name, an asterisk. Not "Law review."

799
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,810
也不是標明我的成績  而是為了多樣化
Not second in my class. Diversity.

800
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,940
對你的待遇是一樣的
You were treated the same.

801
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,540
你可以這么告訴自己  但我們都知道真相
You tell yourself that, but we both know the truth,

802
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,160
這也是我能夠安心入睡的原因
which is why I sleep at night just fine.

803
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,060
但這并不會改變這個案子的實質對吧
Well, it doesn't change the facts in this case, does it?

804
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,310
不  不會  但這個會
No. No, it doesn't, but this will.

805
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,950
查爾斯  你記得路易·利特吧
Charles, you remember Louis Litt?

806
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,960
對不起  我不能跑過來
Sorry, I couldn't run.

807
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,550
醫生讓我不要太著急
Doctor wanted me to take it easy.

808
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,660
你好  查爾斯
Hey, Charles.

809
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,270
很高興見到你
Great to see you.

810
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,980
你講那個故事只是為了拖延時間吧
You told me that story to stall.

811
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,060
確實是為了拖時間
That was a stall...

812
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,000
但接下來是為了我自己
But this is for me.

813
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,280
當我看到我名字旁邊的注釋時
When I saw that asterisk next to my name,

814
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,110
真是讓我覺得惡心  因為我立刻就明白
it made me sick to my stomach, because in one second,

815
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,670
你會用一種什么樣的眼光看我了
I understood how you will always see me.

816
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,980
所以那張卡確實是代表感謝
So that card was a thank you,

817
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,090
因為如果我沒有感到惡心
because if I hadn't have felt sick,

818
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,520
我就不會如此努力的工作
then I might not have worked as hard as I did

819
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,400
從而取得現在的成就
to get where I am today.

820
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,520
你喚醒了沉睡的巨龍  查爾斯
You woke the dragon, Charles.

821
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,350
你現在覺得我怎么樣
How do you like me now?

822
00:39:48,000 --> 00:40:48,000
人人影視
YYeTs.com

823
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,070
我知道你在那
I know you're there.

824
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,230
需要我做些什么嗎
You need anything?

825
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,420
不用
No.

826
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,670
公開募股的事情搞定了
The I.P.O. is wrapped up.

827
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,070
周一早晨上市
We go public monday morning.

828
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,530
我不是指公開募股的事
I wasn't talking about the I.P.O.

829
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,180
我是在說邁克的事
I was talking about how you're feeling about Mike.

830
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,190
我知道
I know.

831
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,590
好吧
Okay.

832
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,290
晚安  哈維
Good night, Harvey.

833
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,620
我準備告訴斯科特
I'm gonna tell Scottie.

834
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,200
邁克的事  你瘋了嗎
About Mike? Are you crazy?

835
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,410
你不能二者兼得  唐娜
You can't have it both ways, Donna.

836
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,830
你不能讓我敞開心扉的同時還要保守秘密
You can't tell me to open up and then keep my secrets.

837
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,980
你花了一年多的時間去掩蓋這件事
You spent more than a year covering it up.

838
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,920
你還試圖讓他再次犯罪去掩蓋原來的錯誤
You tried to get him to commit another crime to cover it up,

839
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,200
-現在呢  -你說我應該告訴她
- and now-- - You said I should tell her

840
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,820
到底是什么事情讓我煩惱
what's really bothering me!

841
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,070
我是說你的感受
I meant your feelings.

842
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,280
而不是承認一項罪行
I didn't mean confess to a felony.

843
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,000
這就是我的感受
These are my goddamn feelings!

844
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,480
唐娜  我雇他的時候做了些事情
Donna, I did something when I hired him.

845
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,990
導致了現在這些問題
It's caused all of this.

846
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:51,130
但我不能告訴她  這快把我逼瘋了
I can't tell her, and it's driving me crazy!

847
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,870
好吧  邁克就要走了  哈維
Okay. Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.

848
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,110
我雖然不愿意他走  但這樣威脅也沒了
I hate that he's gone, but the jeopardy's gone too.

849
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,200
都結束了
It's done.

850
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,770
現在你卻想回過頭告訴一個...
And now you want to turn around and tell someone who--

851
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,330
一個什么
Someone who what?

852
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,410
沒什么
Nothing.

853
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,940
不行  你最好把話說完
No, you better finish that sentence.

854
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,270
一個生你氣的人  哈維
Someone who's pissed at you, Harvey.

855
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,370
一個一直找理由生你氣的人
Someone who keeps finding a reason to be pissed at you,

856
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,640
不是第三次了  也不是第五次
and it's not the third time, and it's not the fifth time,

857
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,570
當然也不是最后一次
and it's not the last time.

858
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,320
我認為你是在試圖
I thought you were trying

859
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,390
幫我解決感情問題  而不是添亂
to help my relationship, not shit on it.

860
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,150
你可以對我喊  沒事
Okay, you want to yell at me? Fine.

861
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,840
因為我知道你不生我的氣
Because I know you're not mad at me.

862
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,930
我也知道你告訴這個愚蠢的主意
And I know you're only telling me this stupid idea

863
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,270
只是因為你想我告訴你一些你已經知道的事
because you want me to tell you what you already know.

864
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,250
你不能  哈維
You can't, Harvey.

865
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,190
你想告訴她這很好  但你不能說
It's good that you want to, but you can't.

866
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,280
能給我點時間嗎
Could I have a minute?

867
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,840
祝賀我吧
Congratulate me.
