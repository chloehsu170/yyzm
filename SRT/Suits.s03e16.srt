1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,390
 《訴訟雙雄》前情提要

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,420
我想讓自己合法化
I want to go legit.

3
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:02,860
你不能
You can't.

4
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,680
那我找羅拉·詹森黑進資格考名單
Then I get Lola Jensen to hack into the bar

5
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,920
把我名字加進去  就像她黑哈佛一樣
and just put me in there, just like she did with Harvard.

6
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,330
不想被人抓到辮子
Rule number one of not getting caught,

7
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,860
就是別輕舉妄動
you don't move the goddamn body.

8
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,070
哈維  我無路可走了
Harvey, I'm stuck.

9
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,030
我不能這樣過一輩子
I can't live my whole life like this.

10
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,530
我們是投資銀行家
We're investment bankers.

11
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,460
我們的工作比你們的厲害多了
Our job blows yours out of the water.

12
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,090
承認吧  你想讓我接受那份工作
Just admit it. You want me to take the job,

13
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,330
但你不敢說
but you're too afraid to say it.

14
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,750
我希望你接受那份工作
I want you to take the job.

15
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,380
你和你的手下與哈羅德·甘德森合謀
You and your associate conspired with Harold Gunderson

16
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,400
對你們自己的客戶發起了訴訟
to file a lawsuit against your own client.

17
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,650
那就是賄賂
That is a bribe.

18
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,200
柯靈知道了你與哈羅德·甘德森
Quelling knows about your bullshit lawsuit

19
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,180
那個狗屁官司了
with Harold Gunderson.

20
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,510
打電話給羅拉·詹森
You need to call Lola Jensen.

21
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,600
你自己也說過  黑進資格考名單
You said it yourself. Hacking into the bar

22
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,110
比我現在犯的罪還重一倍
is twice the crime I've been committing.

23
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,280
我告訴你  柯靈發現你了
I am telling you Quelling is on the trail.

24
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,050
就算你辭職也無濟于事
And you quitting isn't gonna change that.

25
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,290
你讓邁克走了
You're letting Mike walk out the door

26
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,370
甚至沒有試圖阻攔他
without trying to stop him.

27
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,230
每次我問你什么事
Any time I ask you about anything,

28
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,590
你都只會告訴我你不能說
all you say is, "I can't talk about it."

29
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,330
邁克就要走了  哈維
Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.

30
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,620
這樣威脅也沒了
The jeopardy's gone too.

31
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,640
現在你卻想回過頭告訴
And now you want to turn around and tell someone

32
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,180
一個一直找理由生你氣的人
who keeps finding a reason to be pissed at you,

33
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,200
不是第三次了  也不是第五次
and it's not the third time, and it's not the fifth time,

34
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,580
當然也不是最后一次
and it's not the last time.

35
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,300
你收了我方客戶競爭對手的錢
You took money from our client's competitors

36
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,850
捏造了案子
to trump up your bullshit suit.

37
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,350
懲罰是剝奪律師資格
The penalty is being disbarred.

38
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,950
我生來就是律師
Being a lawyer is what I am.

39
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,300
若你奪走...
If you take that away...

40
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,530
決定權在你
It's up to you.

41
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,010
我會撤銷訴訟
I'll drop the suit.

42
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,390
我正式成為紐約律師協會的一員了
I'm officially a member of the New York bar.

43
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,050
你去找羅拉了
You went to Lola?

44
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,410
我想留下來
I want to stay.

45
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,650
我很想拿香檳來
I'd bring in champagne,

46
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,860
但經歷了那么多
but after all we've been through,

47
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,490
我們還是喝威士忌更合適
I think scotch seems more appropriate.

48
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,420
是嗎
Does it?

49
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,520
哈維  我們談過了
Harvey, we've had this conversation once.

50
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,610
如果你想要一個不把心里話說出來的人
If you want someone who doesn't speak their mind,

51
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,930
那你得另請高明了
I'm not that person.

52
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,610
我知道
I know.

53
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,170
而且邁克留下也不會改變我的想法
And Mike staying doesn't change my opinion.

54
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,430
告訴斯科特他的事是錯誤的
Telling Scottie about him is a mistake.

55
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,760
我知道
I know.

56
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,330
那你怎么那么沉默
Then why are you being so quiet?

57
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,910
一個一直找理由生你氣的人
Someone who keeps finding a way to be pissed at me,

58
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,830
不是第三次了  也不是第五次
and it's not the third time or the fifth time

59
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,000
也不是最后一次
or the last time.

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,370
-我沒想這么說的  -可你說了
- I wasn't gonna say that. - Yeah, well, you did.

61
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,350
是你逼我的
Because you forced it out of me.

62
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,560
唐娜  你希不希望我跟斯考特好下去
Donna, do you want me and Scottie to succeed or not?

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,980
我希望你幸福
I want you to be happy.

64
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,260
-這是在逃避  -不是的
- That's an evasive answer. - No, it isn't.

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,410
但我不能定義什么是你的幸福
Just isn't up to me to decide what that means.

66
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,430
我們要不要喝酒慶祝邁克留下了
Now are we gonna drink to Mike staying or what?

67
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,620
給我
Give me that.

68
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,040
不要那杯
Not that one.

69
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,250
大的那杯
The bigger one.

70
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,590
真的
Seriously?

71
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,410
你回來太好了
I'm so glad you're home.

72
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,860
我做了晚飯  因為我想慶祝
I made dinner because I want to celebrate.

73
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,150
我不會接受那份工作
I'm not taking the job.

74
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,490
什么
What?

75
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,030
我去見哈維了
I went to see Harvey, and, um...

76
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,980
我告訴他我要留下了
I told him that I'm staying.

77
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,950
那這事讓你寢食難安就不管了嗎
What about the fact that it was eating you up?

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,650
瑞秋  我知道你不想要這樣
Look, Rachel, I know this isn't what you wanted.

79
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,780
我不想
What I wanted?

80
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,570
我根本不想發表意見
I didn't wanna give you my opinion at all,

81
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,790
但你非逼我說出來
but you forced it out of me,

82
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,190
然后你告訴我你會接受這份工作
and then you told me that you were gonna take the job.

83
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,730
瑞秋  聽我說...
Okay, Rachel--

84
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,910
不要  現在你又來跟我說
No, and now you come in here,

85
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,630
你要繼續做個騙子
and you tell me you're gonna stay a fraud.

86
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,110
-是律師  -是騙子
- A lawyer. - A fraud.

87
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,130
你不是愿意接受我真實的樣子嗎
What happened to accepting me for who I am?

88
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,660
你不是要接受那份工作嗎
What happened to you taking the job?

89
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,380
那是條出路
It was a way out.

90
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,860
你說你擔心如果你說出了你的看法
You said you were afraid if you told me your opinion,

91
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,130
我會為此責備你
I'd hold it against you,

92
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,150
但現在我沒有按照你說的做
but now that I'm not doing what you told me to,

93
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,530
你要為此責備我
you're holding it against me.

94
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,540
是的
I am.

95
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,830
這不公平
Yeah, that's not fair.

96
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,800
我要知道從你說
I wanna know what changed

97
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,750
你打算接受那份工作到現在發生了什么
from when you told me you were gonna take the job to now.

98
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,310
我去見柯靈了
I went to see Quelling.

99
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,230
曾有人給他開出了很不錯的條件
He once had an offer on the table

100
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,960
足以改變他的生活
that would change his life,

101
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,330
他卻拒絕了
and he turned it down

102
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,060
因為他想為他的客戶努力爭取
because he wanted to do what was right for his clients.

103
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,200
這害他失去一切
Cost him everything.

104
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,430
他還唯一擁有的
The only thing it didn't cost him

105
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,630
就是能繼續做律師
was his ability to practice law.

106
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,050
我不想奪走那一點
And I didn't want to take it away from him

107
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,440
我也不想奪走我自己做律師的機會
just like I don't wanna take it away from me.

108
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,020
-邁克  -你說留下會讓我寢食難安
- Mike - You said that staying is eating me up,

109
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,190
但想到要離開  我更痛苦
but the thought of going is eating me up more.

110
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,160
我還沒準備好  瑞秋
I'm just--I'm not ready to leave, Rachel.

111
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,750
謝謝
Thanks.

112
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,510
邁克·羅斯
Michael Ross.

113
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,980
我是
Yes?

114
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,700
我們想問你幾個問題
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

115
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,510
你們是誰
Who's "We"?

116
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,380
聯邦檢察官辦公室
The U.S. Attorney's office.

117
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,560
有什么事
What can I help you with?

118
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,560
我們希望能私下談談
We'd prefer to have this conversation in private.

119
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,250
-希望  -堅持
- Prefer? - Insist.

120
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,530
斯科特
Scottie.

121
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,420
我知道我們吵了一架
I know we got in a fight,

122
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,440
但10點前喝酒就能解決問題了嗎
but drinking before 10:00 a.m., is that really the answer?

123
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,510
《廣告狂人》里就這樣
It is on Mad Men.

124
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,530
而且那家伙拽什么啊
Who's that guy think he is anyway?

125
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,480
邁克不走了
Mike's staying.

126
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,860
你一定很高興
You must be happy.

127
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,830
是啊
I am.

128
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,420
斯科特  我會對你更加坦誠
Scottie, I'm gonna do better about being open with you.

129
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,340
好
Good.

130
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,840
我們沒事了吧
Are we good?

131
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,810
沒事了
We're good.

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,000
我們今晚出去玩玩吧
Then let's go out tonight and have some fun.

133
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,150
好啊
I'm in.

134
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,320
斯科特
Scottie.

135
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,990
怎么
Yeah?

136
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,270
去個沒去過的地方吧
Let's go somewhere new.

137
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,400
唐娜  別教訓我
Donna, I don't wanna hear it.

138
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,710
我沒跟她說邁克的事
I didn't tell her about Mike.

139
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,580
哈維  斯特芬妮·利斯頓剛剛給我打了電話
Harvey, Stephanie Liston just called me.

140
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,620
你在聯邦檢察官辦公室的那個朋友
Your friend from the U.S. Attorney's office?

141
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,040
她說邁克剛剛被帶去問話
She said they just brought Mike in for questioning.

142
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,280
羅斯先生  我是埃里克·伍德爾
Mr. Ross, Eric Woodall.

143
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,470
我是聯邦檢察官...

負責紐約南部地區
For the southern district of New York.

145
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,320
我知道你是哪位
Yeah, I know who you are.

146
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,060
那你就知道自己有大麻煩了
Then you know you're in a shitload of trouble.

147
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,460
你是自己坦白還是我說
You wanna come clean, or should I lay it out for you?

148
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,380
我不知道你在說什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

149
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,280
你跟哈羅德·甘德森密謀
you conspired with Harold Gunderson

150
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,330
欺騙了美國政府
to defraud the United States government

151
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,990
賄賂了艾娃·海辛頓一案中對她不利的證人
by paying off witnesses against Ava Hessington.

152
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,050
什么
What?

153
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,260
你似乎很吃驚
You sound surprised.

154
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,810
是啊  因為這純屬胡扯
I am because it's bullshit.

155
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,380
不是胡扯
It's not bullshit.

156
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,400
你要蹲很久的監獄了  朋友
You're facing some major prison time, my friend.

157
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,080
-我不是你的朋友  -可以做朋友啊
- I'm not your friend. - You can be.

158
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,150
不必了
Pass.

159
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,330
我和解了一樁訴訟  我沒做什么違法的事
I settled a lawsuit, okay? I didn't do anything wrong.

160
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,120
我也這么想的
Hey, I don't think you did.

161
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,790
至少不是你自己做的
Well, not on your own anyway.

162
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,130
你有什么要問的嗎
Is there a question?

163
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,740
得了  你是個機靈的年輕人
Come on, you're a bright young man.

164
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,070
你看得出我想要什么
You see where I'm going.

165
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,220
我不要交易員
I don't want the dealer.

166
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,970
我要真正拿錢的
I want the supplier.

167
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,710
哈維·斯佩克特
Harvey Specter.

168
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,020
你供出他  我馬上跟你做交易
Roll over on him, I'll cut a deal right now.

第三季   第十六集

本季終

177
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,570
哈維·斯佩克特  我是邁克·羅斯的律師
Harvey Specter. I represent Mike Ross.

178
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,980
你不能過去  先生
Sir, you can't go back there. Sir!

179
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,140
你好啊
Well, hey there.

180
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,450
你要起訴他嗎
Are you charging him?

181
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,380
-暫時不  -那他跟我走
- Not at the moment. - Then he's coming with me.

182
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,970
你無權帶他來
And you had no right to bring him in.

183
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,780
我就有這個權利
I had every right to bring him in,

184
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,890
但那無所謂  他是自愿來的
but it doesn't matter 'cause he came in voluntarily.

185
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,270
那他這就要走了
And he's leaving immediately.

186
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,860
我們只是在友好地聊聊
We were just having a friendly conversation

187
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,570
艾娃·海辛頓一案中那些
about the witnesses who suddenly fell out

188
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,650
突然消失的證人
of the Ava Hessington case.

189
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,470
看來你的手下跟布萊頓-古爾德的
Seems your associate was a little chummy

190
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,570
一個律師是好朋友
with the associate at Bratton Gould.

191
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,210
好像是叫哈維·甘德森吧
Harvey Gunderson, I think, is his name.

192
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,110
是哈羅德·甘德森
Harold Gunderson.

193
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,880
是啊
You're right.

194
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,420
你才是哈維
You're Harvey.

195
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,390
我上庭之前可得把名字記清楚了
I gotta keep this all straight in my head before I make my case.

196
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,700
等我把哈羅德找來
Because once we bring Harold in,

197
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,610
他就會指證邁克
he'll point the finger at Mike,

198
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,750
邁克就只能
who will then have no choice

199
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,950
指證你了  哈維
but to bring it right home to you, Harvey.

200
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,990
我保證我再不會忘記你的名字了
I promise I won't forget your name again.

201
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,990
給我開門
Open that door.

202
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,200
跟你聊得很開心  邁克
Good talking to you, Mike.

203
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,740
希望以后有很多機會再談
Hope it's the first of many.

204
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,410
杰西卡  我有可怕的事要告訴你
Jessica, I have some dire news.

205
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,870
我剛剛路過會議室
I was just walking by the conference room,

206
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,180
然后我看見麥克斯·波拉德一個人在里面坐著
and I saw Max Pollard sitting there all by himself.

207
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,520
哈維沒出現嗎
Harvey was a no-show?

208
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,870
別擔心  我會搞定一切的
Don't worry, I took care of everything,

209
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,900
但是這可不像哈維會做的事
but it's not like Harvey to miss a meeting.

210
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,750
謝謝你  路易  我會調查這件事的
Thank you, Louis. I'll look into it.

211
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,170
你瞧  事情就是這樣了
You see, that's just it.

212
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,800
我覺得他可能有點不對勁
I think something might be wrong with him.

213
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,430
你是說他是個間諜嗎
You mean like he's a spy?

214
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,450
不是  杰西卡  聽著
No, Jessica, listen.

215
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,850
自從我心臟病發以來
Ever since my heart attack,

216
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,510
我一直在擔心其他人的健康
I've been worrying about other people's health.

217
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,140
我本來可以問唐娜的  但是我不想
And I'd ask Donna, but I don't wanna burden her

218
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,900
讓她擔心哈維終有一死
with the knowledge of his mortality.

219
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,740
你覺得唐娜不知道哈維是凡人也會死嗎
You don't think Donna knows Harvey can die?

220
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,470
杰西卡  我知道
Look, Jessica, I know

221
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,690
哈維看起來精瘦而且挺健康的
Harvey appears to be lean and relatively fit,

222
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,100
但就算是最帥的人也可能得冠心病
but coronary disease can strike even the most handsome.

223
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,580
路易  聽我說
Louis, listen to me.

224
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,170
哈維沒事  他也沒得過心臟病
Harvey isn't sick. He didn't have a heart attack.

225
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,450
而就算他錯過了那次會議
And if he missed that meeting,

226
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,730
我肯定他有個好理由
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.

227
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,890
我確信你是對的
I'm sure you're right.

228
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,510
我要去查查我的血壓了
I'm gonna go check my blood pressure.

229
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,730
好主意
Oh, good idea.

230
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,480
哈維死哪去了
Where the hell is Harvey?

231
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,730
他有錯過什么事嗎
Is he supposed to be somewhere he's not?

232
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,770
唐娜  別和我玩這套
Donna, no games.

233
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,970
他放了個老客戶的鴿子
He missed a meeting with a longtime client,

234
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,460
所以要么是你工作出錯了  而你從沒出過錯
so either you screwed up, which you never do,

235
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,110
要么就是有什么緊急情況我卻不知道
or there's an emergency I'm not being told about.

236
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,370
兩者兼有
Both.

237
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,350
意思是
Meaning?

238
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,460
我忘了取消那個會議
I forgot to cancel that meeting

239
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,160
因為有個緊急情況
because there's an emergency.

240
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,000
怎么回事
What is it?

241
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,800
邁克·羅斯今天早上被叫去問話了
Mike Ross got called in for questioning this morning.

242
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,230
真是對不起  哈維
Sorry about this, Harvey.

243
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,910
有可能會更糟的
Could have been worse.

244
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,180
你覺得他們有抓到什么把柄嗎
You thought they had me for being a fraud?

245
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,070
我不覺得他們是因為
Well, I didn't think they had you

246
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,860
你逾期未還書而抓你
for overdue library books.

247
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,370
你為什么會跟他們走
Why'd you go with them in the first place?

248
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,530
你奶奶沒教過你
Didn't your grandmother ever teach you

249
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,230
別上陌生人的車嗎
not to get into cars with strangers?

250
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,560
我試圖表現的配合一點
I was being cooperative.

251
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,320
別再做這種事了
Well, don't do that again.

252
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,760
該死的柯靈
Goddamn Quelling.

253
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,460
他不僅向律師協會舉報了我們
He didn't just hand us to the bar.

254
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,190
還去找了司法部
He went to the justice department.

255
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,210
簡直不敢相信
I can't believe it.

256
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,280
我看著他的雙眼  他向我保證過的
I looked him in the eye. He gave me his word.

257
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,050
滾他大爺的  我要去律師協會舉報他
Screw that guy. I'm turning him into the bar.

258
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,100
現在他不是我們的問題
Right now he's not our problem.

259
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,140
哈羅德才是
Harold is.

260
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,630
不  我會去和他談談的
No, I'm gonna talk to him.

261
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,910
想都別想
Not a chance.

262
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,140
哈維  他們還沒把他牽扯進來
Harvey, they haven't brought him in yet.

263
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,660
我只需要花上五分鐘告訴他
All I need is five minutes to tell him--

264
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,840
要堅持你編的故事
-- to stick to your story?

265
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,060
那正是他們還沒把他牽扯進來的原因
That's exactly why they haven't brought him in yet.

266
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,240
你一去找哈羅德談
You talk to Harold,

267
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,800
他們就會發現  我們就完了
they'll be watching, we'll be done.

268
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,320
假如我們不趕在這個叫伍德爾的人叫他去談話之前
If we don't talk to him before this Woodall guy

269
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,290
和他談談  我們就麻煩大了
gets him in the room, we're in deep shit.

270
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,400
那我們得在不和他直接接觸的情況下和他談談
Then we need to talk to him without talking to him.

271
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,500
艾莉森·霍特
Allison Holt.

272
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,190
哈維·斯佩克特
Harvey Specter.

273
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,020
我一點也不驚訝會見到你
Can't say I'm surprised to see you.

274
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,230
我猜這意味著你已經和聯邦檢察官談過了
So I assume that means you've spoken to the U.S. Attorney.

275
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,060
的確
I have.

276
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,120
那我建議我們確認一下
Then I suggest we make sure

277
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,770
我倆依然有所共識
we're on the same page.

278
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,070
和你不一樣  我可不會
Unlike you, I don't automatically

279
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,950
保護某個可能會威脅到我律所的人
protect someone who may have jeopardized my firm.

280
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,620
伍德爾去找你時你到底說了什么
What exactly did you say when Woodall came to you?

281
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,010
他沒來找我  是我去找他的
He didn't come to me. I went to him.

282
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,840
什么
What?

283
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,050
一個叫詹姆斯·柯靈的人來找過我
A man named James Quelling came at me,

284
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,390
詢問那個哈羅德·甘德森以及邁克·羅斯
Questioning the settlement between Harold Gunderson,

285
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,400
還有你的謀殺案證人達成的和解
Mike Ross, and your murder witnesses.

286
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,190
所以你就直接去找了聯邦檢察官
So you go straight to the U.S. Attorney?

287
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,650
我的誠信受到了質疑
My integrity was questioned.

288
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,850
首先要做的可不是去找
First step isn't to go to the person

289
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,610
我被指控與其勾結的人  來掩蓋事實
I'm accused of colluding with to cover it up.

290
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,750
就回答我一個問題
Answer me one thing--

291
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,510
哈羅德·甘德森知道發生了什么事嗎
Does Harold Gunderson know what's going on?

292
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,930
我不知道他知道些什么
I don't know what he knows,

293
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,670
而且  坦白地說  我不在乎
and, frankly, I don't care.

294
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,260
我一小時前炒了哈羅德·甘德森
I fired Harold Gunderson an hour ago.

295
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,580
我能和你談一小會兒嗎
Can I talk to you for a second?

296
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,770
當然
Of course.

297
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,410
我剛剛被帶去市中心了
I just got taken downtown.

298
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,410
什么
What?

299
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,390
聯邦檢察官辦公室把我帶去問話
The U.S. Attorney's office brought me in for questioning.

300
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,730
我以為是因為我自己的事  但其實不是
I thought it was about me, but it wasn't.

301
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,310
謝天謝地
Thank god.

302
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,080
不  瑞秋  情況還是很糟糕
No, Rachel, it's still bad.

303
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,170
他們在調查艾娃的審判前
They're looking into the settlement

304
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,170
我和哈羅德的和解協議
that I made with Harold before Ava's trial.

305
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,280
那個交易可不完全是合法的
That deal wasn't exactly legitimate.

306
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,360
而他們希望我告發哈維
And they want me to turn on Harvey.

307
00:12:36,560 --> 00:13:36,560
人人影視
YYeTs.com

308
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,380
我就知道你應接受那份工作的
I knew you should have taken that job.

309
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,030
這個和那個沒關系
This has nothing to do with that.

310
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,020
沒有嗎
Doesn't it?

311
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,210
假如你不在這兒工作
If you weren't working here,

312
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,110
他們就不能利用你和哈維的關系
they wouldn't be able to use your relationship

313
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,450
來做籌碼了
with Harvey as leverage.

314
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,860
你覺得我不在這里工作的話
You think I would turn my back on him

315
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,320
就會背棄他嗎
even if I wasn't working here?

316
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,020
我覺得你永遠不會背棄哈維
I don't think you'd ever turn your back on Harvey.

317
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,330
而那正是問題所在
That's the problem.

318
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,790
-這是什么意思  -哈維想讓你留下
- What does that mean? - Harvey wanted you to stay.

319
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,610
我想要你離開  你選擇了留下
I wanted you to leave. You chose to stay.

320
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,290
所以你的優先考慮對象  在我看來已經很清楚了
So your priorities, they seem pretty clear to me.

321
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,480
-瑞秋  拜托  -等等
- Rachel, come on. - Hey, wait a minute.

322
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,690
假如他們要起訴你
If they charge you with something,

323
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,820
他們就要查看你的記錄
they're gonna go through your records,

324
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,910
然后他們就會發現
and they are going to realize

325
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,960
你不是律師協會的一員
that you're not a member of the bar.

326
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,740
不  他們不會發現的
No, they won't.

327
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,460
你在說什么呢
What are you talking about?

328
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,710
我讓羅拉·詹森黑進了律師協會名單
I had Lola Jensen hack into the bar

329
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,440
把我加進記錄里了
and put me in their records.

330
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,010
你本來打算什么時候告訴我這件事呢
And when were you going to tell me?

331
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,680
我昨晚本來想告訴你一切的
I was going to tell you everything last night,

332
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,790
但你當時看起來不太有心情
but you didn't exactly seem like you were in the mood.

333
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,460
我現在也不太有心情
Oh, I'm not in the mood right now either.

334
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,020
我要去外面透透氣
I am gonna go outside and get some air.

335
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,560
你為何不待在這里想想
Why don't you just stay here and figure out

336
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,970
還能不能犯點別的罪
if there's some other crime you can commit

337
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,310
來擺脫這件事
to get out of this one?

338
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,710
這件事一出問題你就應該打電話給我的
You should have called me the minute this went down.

339
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,760
當時沒時間了
There wasn't time.

340
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,350
你可有時間去見艾莉森·霍特啊
You had time to see Allison Holt.

341
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,160
我是想搶先解決這個問題
I was trying to get out in front of it.

342
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,180
艾莉森·霍特不是我們的問題
Allison Holt isn't our problem.

343
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,640
邁克·羅斯才是
Mike Ross is.

344
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,320
聯邦檢察官一直在到處窺探
The U.S. Attorney keeps poking around,

345
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,890
他會發現他的明星證人
he's gonna find out that his star witness

346
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,000
甚至都不是律師協會的
isn't even in the bar.

347
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,210
不  他不會發現的
No, he won't.

348
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,200
假如他們查看律師協會的記錄  會發現邁克·羅斯
If they look in the bar, they'll find Mike Ross

349
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,970
正是其中一員
listed as a member.

350
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,790
你讓他犯下了另一個重罪嗎
You had him commit another felony?

351
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,310
你想讓我大聲承認嗎
You want me to say that out loud?

352
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,200
不  我不想
No, I don't.

353
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,550
我比較想討論我們手頭的問題
I'd rather get back to the matter at hand.

354
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,880
我們要確保哈羅德·甘德森不會開口
We need to make sure Harold Gunderson doesn't talk.

355
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,190
那你就得多了解了解
Then you need to learn more

356
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,870
那個想撬開他的嘴的人
about the man who's trying to make him talk,

357
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,200
因為他是沖著你來的
because he's coming for you,

358
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,820
但你卻不知道他是誰
and you don't know who he is,

359
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,690
他會怎么做  他掌握了些什么
what he'll do, or what he's got.

360
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,680
我只知道一件事
I know one thing--

361
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,880
如果他有任何證據
if he had any kind of proof,

362
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,030
肯定有人已經被捕了
someone here would have already been arrested.

363
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,530
被捕  理由是什么
Arrested? For what?

364
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,790
我們正因為海辛頓案里和布萊頓·古爾德
We're being investigated for the settlement

365
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,350
達成的和解協議接受調查
between us and Bratton Gould in the Hessington case.

366
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,350
柯靈還沒放手嗎
Quelling didn't go away?

367
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,610
柯靈威脅說要去律師協會舉報我們
Quelling threatened to go to the bar.

368
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,210
但現在是聯邦檢察官辦公室在查
This is the U.S. Attorney's office.

369
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,450
除非指控有理有據  不然都不必擔心
Well, that only matters if the allegations have merit.

370
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,220
我從沒想過會這么問
I never thought I would have to ask this,

371
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,260
但指控是有理有據的嗎
but do the allegations have merit?

372
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,750
我們正在處理  斯科特
We're handling this, Scottie.

373
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,890
我沒問是誰在處理
I didn't ask who was handling it.

374
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,720
我問的是有沒有證據
I asked if they have merit.

375
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,900
斯科特  斯科特
Scottie. Scottie.

376
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,470
怎么  又要施展魅力了嗎
What, are you gonna be charming?

377
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,820
又要引用電視劇臺詞嗎
Quote a TV show?

378
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,500
不是說"我會做得更好"嗎
What happened to "I'm going to do better"?

379
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,460
該死的  我正努力著呢
God damn it, I'm trying.

380
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,590
哈維  我覺得你不知道努力是什么意思
Harvey, I don't think you understand what trying means.

381
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,290
這么說吧  斯科特  你總是覺得
You know what, scottie? You keep on thinking

382
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,590
有些事你被瞞在鼓里  但
that there are things being withheld from you, but--

383
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,920
但什么  只是公事嗎
But what? It's just business?

384
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,190
-確實只是公事  -好
- It is just business. - Fine.

385
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,120
作為高級合伙人  我想知道
As a senior partner, I want to know

386
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,080
這家律所是否公然違法
if this firm outright broke any laws.

387
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,100
-哈維  我得跟你談談  -現在不行  唐娜
- Harvey, I need to talk to you. - Not now, Donna.

388
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,440
如果你要讓我找斯特芬妮
If you want me to talk to Stephanie,

389
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,980
就得告訴我你要我問她些什么
you have to tell me what you want me to ask her right now.

390
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,330
我猜你會說"現在不是時候  斯科特"
I guess it's "Not now, Scottie."

391
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,960
邁克  邁克  我得跟你談談
Mike? Mike. I need to talk to you.

392
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,720
不  不  我現在甚至不能跟你待在一起
No, no, I can't even be seen with you.

393
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,230
-快走  -但你必須得跟我談談
- Go, now. - But you have to talk to me.

394
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,050
艾莉森·霍特剛剛無緣無故解雇了我
Allison Holt just fired me out of the blue.

395
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,810
-我現在怕得要死  伙計  -哈羅德  聽我說
- I'm freaking out, man. - Harold, listen to me.

396
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,400
冷靜下來  行不
You have to calm down, all right?

397
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,970
哈羅德·甘德森  這里不歡迎你
Harold Gunderson, you're not welcome here.

398
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,370
別打岔  路易
You know what, Louis?

399
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,980
我們正聊著事情呢  所以
We're kind of in the middle of something right now, so--

400
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,320
我不管  邁克  幫個忙
Well, I don't give a shit. Mike, do me a favor.

401
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,610
別讓這個不識抬舉的前員工進入我們的辦公室
Do not let this unappreciative ex-employee into our offices.

402
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,380
哈羅德  你得走了  現在就走
Harold, you have to go, right now.

403
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,610
不  等等  邁克  拜托了
No, wait, mike. Please.

404
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,650
聯邦檢察官辦公室給我打了電話
I got a call from the U.S. Attorney's office

405
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,210
要我去一趟
asking for me to come in.

406
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,770
不知道為什么  他們盯上了我們干的事
Somehow, they're onto what we did,

407
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,960
-我覺得我們得  -哈羅德  哈羅德
- and I think we need to-- - Harold, Harold, Harold. Harold.

408
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,770
我只知道是你堅持要簽和解協議
All I know about that settlement is that you stuck it to us

409
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,740
因為你覺得這是個報復我們解雇你的好機會
because you saw the chance to get back at us for firing you.

410
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,340
-邁克  不是這樣  -我不想聽  哈羅德
- Mike, that's not true. - I don't want to hear it, Harold.

411
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,340
你的行為是打擊報復
What you did was harsh and vindictive,

412
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,920
但卻完全合法  因為是你提出的
but it was completely legal because you initiated it.

413
00:16:36,560 --> 00:17:36,560
人人影視
YYeTs.com

414
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,770
只要我們都記著這一點  沒人能
And nobody can prove anything other than that

415
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,010
拿出什么別的證據
as long as we both remember it.

416
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,970
-我丟了工作  邁克  -很遺憾  哈羅德
- I lost my job, Mike. - I'm sorry about that, Harold.

417
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,030
我希望能幫你點什么
I wish there was something I could do.

418
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,810
但現在我得回去了
Now I have to go back inside.

419
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,790
邁克·羅斯  哈羅德·甘德森
Michael Ross, Harold Gunderson,

420
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,630
你們被捕了
You're under arrest

421
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,180
罪名是共謀欺詐美國政府
for conspiracy to defraud the United States Government.

422
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,600
謝謝你來見我
Thanks for meeting with me.

423
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,600
唐娜  隨你怎么謝我
Donna, you can thank me all you want.

424
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,400
我一點都不知道埃里克·伍德爾的情況
I don't know anything about Eric Woodall.

425
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,130
斯特芬尼  別這樣
Stephanie, come on.

426
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,170
你對那間辦公室的舉動一清二楚
You know everything that goes on in that office.

427
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,600
只是不想告訴我
You just don't want to tell me.

428
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,140
你想知道什么
What do you want to know?

429
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,360
不如從他為什么沖著哈維來說起
Well, how about we start with why he's coming after Harvey?

430
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,450
因為他憎恨手腳不干凈的律師
Because he hates Dirty Lawyers.

431
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,390
認為他們是地球上的糟粕
He thinks they're the scum of the earth.

432
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,100
而哈維引起了他的注意
And Harvey got on his radar?

433
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,350
伍德爾之所以沒引起你們的注意
And the reason Woodall's not on your radar

434
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,780
是因為他花了四年打贏上一場官司
is because the last case he won took him four years.

435
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,740
你是說他絕不停手嗎
So you're saying he'll stop at nothing?

436
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,190
我從來沒見過
Not that I've ever seen.

437
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,890
那我們得搞清楚他手上有些什么
Then we need to know what he's got.

438
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,820
不行的
No way.

439
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,650
他們把你們的人帶進來時  我聯系了你
I called you when they brought your guy in.

440
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,960
就憑這一點我就可能會丟了工作
I could lose my job for that as it is.

441
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,510
你還有比工作重要得多的東西
You have something else a lot more important than your job,

442
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,670
都得感謝我
thanks to me.

443
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,660
你什么時候才能不拿這點來要挾我
When are you gonna stop holding that over my head?

444
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,270
如果你告訴我我想要的信息  我以后就不會要挾你了
In another 30 seconds if you tell me what I need to know.

445
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,540
好吧
Okay.

446
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,450
他沒有證據
He's got nothing.

447
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,190
但問題是  他沒證據也能贏
But the thing is, he wins with nothing.

448
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,590
你之前說  他憎恨手腳不干凈的律師
You just said he hates dirty lawyers,

449
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,790
現在你又說  他會違法辦事
and now you're saying he'll break the law?

450
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,210
有可能  也可能不違法
He may, he may not.

451
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,960
但他絕對能攪出事來
But he'll definitely bend the shit out of it.

452
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,120
我想知道是怎么回事
I want to know what's going on.

453
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,310
我告訴過你怎么回事
I told you what's going on.

454
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,280
哈維和我正在解決這個問題
Harvey and I are taking care of a situation.

455
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,290
這不算什么狗屁答案  你知道的
That's a bullshit answer, and you know it.

456
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,530
我不知道你和愛德華·達比是怎么相處的
I don't know how it went with you and Edward Darby,

457
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,510
但你帶著這樣的態度走進我的辦公室
but you come into my office with that attitude,

458
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,480
我可不會給你什么好果子吃
and it won't go well for you with me.

459
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,900
我這個態度是因為我給愛德華·達比干活
My attitude comes from the fact that I worked for Edward Darby.

460
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,260
-我可不想給另一個干  -你太過分了
- I don't want to work for another one. - You're way out of line.

461
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,140
你的名字不在這兒的門上
Your name is not on the door here.

462
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,150
是不在  但如果因為你和哈維做過的事
No, but if this all comes down because of something

463
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,240
律所聲名掃地  那我也會受到牽連
you and Harvey did, I'm tainted by it.

464
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,330
那就走人  斯科特  我不攔你
Then walk away, Scottie. I'm not stopping you.

465
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,910
你讓我簽署的不競爭條款攔著我呢
No, the noncompete you had me sign is stopping me.

466
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,970
是它在攔著你嗎
Is that what's stopping you?

467
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,510
杰西卡  我把我的生活搬回了紐約
Jessica, I moved my life back to New York.

468
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,990
我不想再搬走了
I don't want to move again.

469
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,260
我最后問你一次
So I'm asking you one more time--

470
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,220
到底怎么回事
what is going on?

471
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,920
具體怎么回事
What's going on...

472
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,470
就是你和哈維一時沖動決定讓你來這兒
is you and Harvey made an impulsive deal for you to come here,

473
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,930
顯然事情沒有你們預想的那么順
and clearly, it's not working out,

474
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,550
否則現在跟你說話的就不是我
or you'd be having this conversation with him

475
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,060
而是他了
and not me.

476
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,900
看看把誰帶來了
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

477
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,410
我已經在這里待了兩個小時
I've been in here for two hours.

478
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,440
你說我被捕了
You said I was under arrest,

479
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,690
但還沒人來審訊我
but I still haven't been processed.

480
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,030
我要求傳訊哈維
I demand to call Harvey.

481
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,640
抱歉  辦不到
Sorry, we can't have that.

482
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,020
那我猜你也不能判我或其他人有罪 
Then I guess you can't have a guilty verdict against me or anybody else,

483
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,440
我知道我的權利
because I know my rights.

484
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,990
恐怕你的權利正好撞上了
Well, I'm afraid your rights have run smack into

485
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,530
一個叫《愛國者法案》的玩意兒
a little something called the Patriot Act.

486
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,670
不管你扯什么淡  都只適用于恐怖分子
Whatever bullshit you're trying to pull only applies to terrorists.

487
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,600
那我還碰上好事了
Then it's a good thing

488
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,760
海辛頓的證人還真指控了恐怖主義
there are allegations of terrorism against those Hessington witnesses.

489
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,570
你不會得逞的
You're not gonna get away with this.

490
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,290
我不得任何逞
I'm not getting away with anything.

491
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,700
只是通過調查這些指控  做到萬無一失
I'm just being thorough by looking into these allegations.

492
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,490
耐心點吧
Try to be patient.

493
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,840
也許  可以想想
Maybe, uh, think about the fact

494
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,900
哈羅德·甘德森在隔壁也努力耐著性子呢
that Harold Gunderson is trying to be patient right next door.

495
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,780
在踱步啊  不出我所料
Pacing. Right on schedule.

496
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,850
失敗的第一個征兆
First sign that a man is losing it.

497
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,270
這叫走路
It's called walking.

498
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,830
隨你怎么叫
You can call it what you want.

499
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,610
-我眼見為實  -是啊  我也是
- I know what I'm looking at. - Yeah. So do I.

500
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,090
調查了恐怖分子指控
A guy who looked into those terrorist allegations

501
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,480
卻毫無結論
and came up with nothing.

502
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,740
我得說關于那些證人的傳言毫無根據
I'll admit the rumors about those witnesses were unsubstantiated.

503
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,050
但如果我不調查一個和那些可疑的人
But I'd be negligent if I didn't look into an American

504
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,740
聯系緊密的美國人  那我就太大意了
with ties to such questionable characters.

505
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,660
你也永遠不會知道詳盡的背景調查
And you never know what a thorough background check

506
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,210
會發現些什么
is gonna turn up.

507
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,770
那請便吧
Then go ahead.

508
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,820
快去做背景調查  好讓我早點出去
Do your background check, so I can get out of here,

509
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,520
因為所有這些事搞得我好無聊
because all this is doing is making me bored.

510
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,540
這件事就交給我吧
Well, I can take care of that for you.

511
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,160
我把電視打開給你看看吧
Why don't I let you watch a little TV?

512
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,840
這才是踱步
Now, that's pacing.

513
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,090
發現任何關于埃里克·伍德爾的有用信息了嗎
Did you find out anything useful on Eric Woodall?

514
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,880
我發現我們該開始進攻了
I found out we need to start going on offense.

515
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,320
怎么進攻
How?

516
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,010
唐娜正在讓邁克整理所有
Donna's having Mike compile every piece of communication

517
00:21:36,560 --> 00:22:36,560
人人影視
YYeTs.com

518
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,180
達成和解期間的通訊記錄
during that settlement to prove

519
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,590
證明是哈羅德先聯系我們的  而不是相反
Harold contacted us first, not the other way around.

520
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,730
-那是真實情況嗎  -你真的想知道嗎
- Is that true? - You really want to know?

521
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,620
那之后  我們需要審閱
After that, we're gonna read up on

522
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,750
伍德爾上一個案子所有的策略
every tactic Woodall used in his last case.

523
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,580
什么案子
Case?

524
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,550
花了他四年
Took him four years.

525
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,280
他還真是執著啊
Dog with a bone.

526
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,590
這就是我們要開始進攻的原因
That's why we're going on offense.

527
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,210
我也發現了一些事
Well, I found out something too.

528
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,260
斯科特想走了
Scottie wants to leave.

529
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,580
什么
What?

530
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,320
她想免除不競爭條款
She asked out of her noncompete.

531
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,250
你怎么答復她的
And what did you say?

532
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,080
我說我要和我的合伙人討論一下
I said I had to discuss it with my partner.

533
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,020
如果她要是能和她的另一半討論一下就好了
It would have been nice if she discussed it with her partner.

534
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,710
她指責我做了一些很壞的勾當
She accused me of some pretty shady shit.

535
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,620
而且她沒說錯
And she's right.

536
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,920
你指什么
What are you talking about?

537
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,700
我告訴過你
I told you earlier,

538
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,100
我并不想知道邁克和他從業資格的事
I didn't want to know about Mike and the bar,

539
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,670
就在剛才  你還問我是否想知道
and just now, you asked me if I wanted to know

540
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,780
邁克和哈羅德的事
about Mike and Harold, and again,

541
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,350
我還是不想知道
I didn't want to know.

542
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,040
而愛德華·達比也是這么說的
And "I don't want to know" is exactly what Edward Darby said.

543
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,250
我們不是他
We're not him.

544
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,700
愛德華·達比并沒有犯下那些謀殺案
Edward Darby didn't commit those murders.

545
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,310
他只是掩蓋了它們
He just covered them up.

546
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,680
在我看來  我們也在不停的做一些事
And it seems to me we keep doing things,

547
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,350
然后再不得不把它們掩蓋起來
and then we have to keep covering them up.

548
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,990
我們不是他
We're not him.

549
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
哈維
Harvey.

550
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,370
你想讓我怎么答復斯科特
What do you want me to tell Scottie?

551
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,100
如果她不想在這待下去了
If she doesn't want to be here,

552
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,240
就讓她走吧
let her go.

553
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,080
你都做了些什么
What the hell did you do?

554
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,460
你知道我做了什么
You know what I did.

555
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,870
我向協會舉報了你
I handed you in to the bar.

556
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,450
邁克·羅斯和我達成了協議
Mike Ross and I had a deal.

557
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,910
從他被聯邦檢察官帶去問話的那一刻起
Yeah, well, that deal went away when he got brought in

558
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,800
那個協議就作廢了
for questioning by the U.S. Attorney.

559
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,290
什么  那不是我干的
What? That wasn't me.

560
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,120
我沒有找過他們
I didn't go to them.

561
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,890
我不在乎你有沒有找過他們
I don't give a shit if you went to them or not.

562
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,220
這整件事都是因為你被賄賂
This whole thing started when you walked into my office

563
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,100
而要起訴我們開始的
with a lawsuit you were bribed to create.

564
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,960
但在那之后  我和邁克達成了協議
And after that, I made a deal with Mike.

565
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,680
我也信守了我的承諾
And I held to my end of the bargain.

566
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,040
也許你剛才沒聽清
Maybe you didn't hear me.

567
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,100
他們把他帶走  關起來
That deal went away when they picked him up,

568
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,950
并讓他試圖把我供出來時
hauled him in, and then tried to get him

569
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,020
協議就作廢了
to turn on me.

570
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,120
你還有能力阻止這一切
Well, you can still stop this.

571
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,960
但我不打算那么做
Yeah, well, I'm not going to.

572
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,350
那你最好在余生的
Well, then you better look over your shoulder every day

573
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,410
每一天都提高警惕了
for the rest of your natural-born life.

574
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,830
-你說什么  -你知道我說什么
- What did you say? - You heard me.

575
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,650
聽我說  你這個混蛋
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

576
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,920
你掏出支槍  威脅要殺我的人
You pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot my guy,

577
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,580
我不在乎你的本意是什么
and I don't give a shit if you didn't mean to shoot it,

578
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,030
最終槍響了
because it went off.

579
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,770
他們就是因為你才會調查我
They're looking into me because of you.

580
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,270
如果我再聽到你的名字
And I ever so much as hear your name again,

581
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,000
我會找到你  讓你粉身碎骨
I will find you, and I will break every bone in your body.

582
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,740
你就是個傲慢的混蛋
You are nothing but a badass on his high horse.

583
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,710
混蛋先生  也許確實是我導致
Well, Mr. Badass, I may have started them

584
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,850
他們開始調查你的
looking into what you did,

585
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,960
但事情都是你自己做的
but you were the one who did it.

586
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,120
柯靈  趕緊走吧你
Quelling, be on your way.

587
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,920
瑞秋  你看到邁克了嗎
Rachel, have you seen Mike?

588
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,320
路易  我沒有
No, Louis, I haven't.

589
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,170
好吧  出什么事了嗎
Okay. Is something wrong?

590
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,390
是有點事  我們吵架了
Yeah, something's wrong. We got into a fight.

591
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,500
之后就再沒見過他了
I haven't seen him since.

592
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,530
自從他和哈羅德談過以后我就沒見過他了
Well, I haven't seen him since he was talking to Harold,

593
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,300
-但我需要他給  -他和哈羅德談過
- but I need him to give me-- - He was talking to harold?

594
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,110
是啊  我也不清楚
Yeah, I don't know, they were having

595
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,430
他們在樓外傻兮兮的吵  怎么了
some idiotic fight outside. Why?

596
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,700
沒什么  我必須和哈維談談
No, it's nothing. I have to go talk to harvey.

597
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,650
等一下  哈維
Whoa, wait a second. Harvey?

598
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,520
這件事和他今早
Does this have something to do

599
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,610
沒來開會有關系嗎
with why he missed his meeting this morning?

600
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,210
我不能說
I can't.

601
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,260
瑞秋
Rachel.

602
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,720
你必須告訴我到底出了什么事
You need to tell me what the hell's going on right now.

603
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,840
唐娜  我知道你看到了大廳里的事
Donna, I know you saw what happened in the lobby.

604
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,740
我不想聽你提這件事
I don't want to hear about it.

605
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,100
哈維  我找不到邁克了
Harvey, I can't find Mike.

606
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,940
什么
What?

607
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,420
我試過郵件  信息
I've tried his email, I've tried texting,

608
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,340
所有地方都找了
I've looked everywhere.

609
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,380
我要說的是  邁克失蹤了
I'm telling you, Mike is nowhere to be found.

610
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,440
-路易  等一下  -不能等  哈維
- Louis, not now. - Yes, now, Harvey.

611
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,510
我知道他在哪
I know where he is.

612
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,310
他和哈羅德·甘德森一起被捕了
He's under arrest, along with Harold Gunderson.

613
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,010
我們必須馬上趕過去
We need to get down there right now.

614
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,430
讓我理一理
Let me get this straight.

615
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,220
我們逮捕你們的時候
You two were in a heated conversation

616
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,660
你們兩個正在進行很激烈的討論
when we picked you up,

617
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,690
但內容與這件事無關
and that had nothing to do with this.

618
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,680
方方面面都有關
It had everything to do with it.

619
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,410
你是說你正試圖掩蓋罪行嗎
You mean you were trying to cover your tracks.

620
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,580
不  我們在激烈的討論
No, we were having a heated conversation

621
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,980
這些指控是多么的無稽
about what bullshit charges these are.

622
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,590
我受夠了跟你玩游戲了
Okay, I'm done playing your games.

623
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,920
他是你在那個律所唯一的朋友  你被開除了
He was your only friend at that firm, you got fired.

624
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,200
你給他找了另一份工作
You got him another job,

625
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,310
因此你就去找他策劃了這整件事
and that's why you went to him to set this whole thing up.

626
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,670
你的消息都是錯的
You've got your information wrong.

627
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,040
他不是我的朋友
He wasn't my friend.

628
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,770
我有機會挽回他的工作
I had the chance to save his job...

629
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,120
但他卻把我拋下不管了
But instead, he threw me under the bus.

630
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,280
所以我才會發起這個訴訟
That is why I instituted this lawsuit.

631
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,190
所以你可以帶著你的指控滾了
So you can take your bullshit allegations somewhere else

632
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,970
我不會為此犧牲哈維的
because I am not gonna roll on Harvey.

633
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,650
我不會犧牲邁克的
I'm not rolling on mike.

634
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,890
哈羅德也不會犧牲我的
And Harold is not gonna roll on me.

635
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,780
你們排練的不錯啊
You guys are well rehearsed.

636
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,800
所以我要再問一次
So I'll ask you again,

637
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,270
今天你們在街上就是在做這件事嗎
is that what you were doing on the street today?

638
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,300
老天爺啊  你開車慢的跟我外婆一樣
Jesus Christ, you know, you drive like my nana--

639
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,960
他開的像我外婆  她102歲了
He drives like my nana, and she's 102.

640
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,860
放松點  路易  雷盡力了
Relax, Louis. Ray's on it.

641
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,680
沒人能讓我們更快到那了
Nobody's getting us there faster.

642
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,320
我簡直不敢相信發生了這件事
I mean, I can't believe this whole thing's been going on

643
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,390
而且我完全被蒙在鼓里
and I've been completely out of the loop.

644
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,740
路易  我不想多說什么了
Louis, I don't want to rehash it.

645
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,070
當務之急  邁克被關起來了
Right now, Mike's in custody.

646
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,940
我們得把他救出來
We need to get him out.

647
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,110
你得告訴我這到底是怎么回事
Yeah, and you need to tell me what the hell happened.

648
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,640
你是在問我們和哈羅德
Are you asking if we broke the law

649
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,410
和解的時候是否違法了嗎
when we made that settlement with Harold?

650
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,030
我就是想問這個
That's exactly what I'm asking.

651
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,120
確實有點問題
We have exposure.

652
00:26:36,560 --> 00:27:36,560
人人影視
YYeTs.com

653
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,310
那你最好祈禱雷開快點
Well, then you better hope that Ray drives

654
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,520
因為你我都明白
a little goddamn faster, because you and I both know

655
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,020
那里正發生什么事
what's going on in there.

656
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,240
我來跟你說說現在的處境吧
Let me tell you what we are dealing with here.

657
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,090
密謀賄賂證人  七年
Conspiring to bribe witnesses-- seven years.

658
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,710
你為了支持自己的案件遞交了宣誓說明
You filed a sworn declaration in support of your suit.

659
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,150
這是偽證罪  再加兩年
That's perjury-- another two years.

660
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,480
除此之外
And to top it all off,

661
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,570
錢是從境外轉來的
the money was transferred overseas,

662
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,800
所以這是...
which would be--

663
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,600
你也是律師  你自己說
Well, you're a lawyer. Fill in the blank.

664
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,160
-匯款詐騙  -答對了
- Wire fraud. - Bingo.

665
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,910
你中大獎了  獎品是再加二十年
Big winner. And your prize is 20 more years.

666
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,640
丑話說在前面  我保證你要去的
And here's the thing. I am gonna make sure

667
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,800
絕不會是輕松安逸的白領監獄
that it's not a cushy white-collar prison.

668
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,730
太荒唐了
This is just ridiculous.

669
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,490
如果哈羅德現在還能撐住  我真要嚇尿了
If Harold isn't broken by now, I'll shit my pants.

670
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,980
如果哈羅德撐不住了  那等我們到那兒
If Harold's broken, then when we get there,

671
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,780
邁克就要去坐牢了
Mike's gonna be on his way to prison.

672
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,110
他需要有人幫他一把
Someone needs to get in there and hold his hand.

673
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,900
不是隨便什么人都行
Not someone...

674
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,000
-只能是你  -你說真的嗎
- You. - Are you serious?

675
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,410
哈羅德·甘德森現在
I'm the last person in the world

676
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,430
最不想見到的人就是我了
that Harold Gunderson wants to see right now.

677
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,430
路易  我們還是助理律師的時候
Louis, when we were associates,

678
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,590
你最怕的是誰
who did you fear most?

679
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,230
當然是我媽
That's easy. My mother.

680
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,590
我是說在律所里
I meant in the firm.

681
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,920
丹尼爾·哈德曼
Daniel Hardman.

682
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,340
所以如果換了是你在那個房間
So who would you most want to come in

683
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,020
你會希望是誰走進來
and take on Eric Woodall,

684
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,460
收拾埃里克·伍德爾
if you were in that room?

685
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,940
-丹尼爾·哈德曼  -這就對了
- Daniel Hardman. - Exactly.

686
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,420
聽著  哈羅德或許不喜歡你
Look, Harold may not like you,

687
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,570
但他尊重你  而他現在是孤身作戰
but he respects you, and he's all alone.

688
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,130
等我們到了那兒
Now, when we get there,

689
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,170
我希望你激發出你內心的哈德曼
I need you to channel your inner Hardman,

690
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,550
得到他的信任
get him to trust you,

691
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,310
然后讓他給我閉嘴
and then shut him the hell up.

692
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,600
我能跟你談談嗎
Can I talk to you for a second?

693
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,940
你好像憂心忡忡的
You look concerned.

694
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,800
你知道為什么當初哈維要雇一個
Do you know why I never batted an eye when I found out

695
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,300
沒上過法學院的小屁孩時  我眼都沒眨一下嗎
Harvey had hired a kid who didn't go to law school?

696
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,190
因為你對他忠心耿耿
Because you're loyal to him.

697
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,070
因為我知道他內心所想
Because I knew what was inside him.

698
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,210
我覺得如果他有個徒弟
And I thought if he had a protege--

699
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,650
他完全可以從哈佛找個徒弟
He could have hired a protege from Harvard.

700
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,550
那他就不會被逼著去保護他了
But he wouldn't have been forced to protect him.

701
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,280
他也不會成為如今的他
And he wouldn't have become the man he is today.

702
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,150
現在他的徒弟有麻煩了
Well, now that protege is in trouble.

703
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,080
他們拘留了邁克和哈羅德·甘德森
They have Mike and Harold Gunderson in custody.

704
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,170
那哈維也有麻煩了
Then harvey's in trouble too.

705
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,250
不
No.

706
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,730
邁克絕不會背叛哈維的
Mike would never turn on Harvey.

707
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,830
你根本不知道在那個房間里
You never know what might happen to a person

708
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,580
會發生些什么
once they get in that room.

709
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,650
他現在沒空  斯科特
Not now, Scottie.

710
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,330
唐娜  我只是留個言告訴他我想談談
Donna, I'm just writing him a note telling him I wanted to talk.

711
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,700
談談
"To talk."

712
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,960
我想你根本不知道他有多努力
I don't think you know how hard he's trying.

713
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,870
我知道他在努力
I know he's trying.

714
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,930
但我不確定是否這樣就夠了
I'm just not sure that it's good enough.

715
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,410
你早就知道他是什么樣的人  斯科特
You knew who he was, Scottie.

716
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,500
可我以為他會改變
And I thought he would change.

717
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,220
我覺得他已經變了  如果你還是覺得不夠
I think he has changed, and if it's not enough for you, then--

718
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,020
這不是問題所在
That's not the problem.

719
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,080
我是覺得他變得太多了
I think that he's changed too much,

720
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,000
而且是在我回來之前就變了
and I think it happened before I got back.

721
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,940
他是個好人  斯科特
He's a good man, Scottie,

722
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,830
但人無完人
but he's not perfect.

723
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,430
有時候  你只能選擇安于現狀
Sometimes you just have to take what you get,

724
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,110
或斬斷情絲
or walk away.

725
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,990
知道嗎  幾年前他們做過一個試驗
You know, they did an experiment a few years back.

726
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,760
把五只老鼠關在籠子里
Took five mice, put 'em in a cage,

727
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,310
喂食的量只夠他們勉強生存  你猜發生了什么
fed them just enough to survive, and you know what happened?

728
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,280
它們接連將最弱的老鼠逼至角落
One by one, they cornered the weakest mouse

729
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,520
生吞活吃了
and ate him alive.

730
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,380
你知道你進監獄后會怎樣嗎  邁克
You know what you're gonna be when you get to prison, Mike?

731
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,040
-你就是那最弱的老鼠  -扯淡
- The weakest mouse. - Bullshit.

732
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,890
他們是做過研究  我看過報告
They have done studies, and I've read them,

733
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,270
根本不是你說的那樣
and that's not what happens.

734
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,490
老鼠只有在被別的種族洗腦之后
The only way a mouse eats one of his own

735
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,400
才會蠶食自己的種族
is if he's been contaminated by another species.

736
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,560
你說得對  我確實是扯淡的
Yeah, you're right. It's bullshit.

737
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,340
不過你猜猜是誰在五分鐘前
But you know who believed it when I told it to him,

738
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,640
信了我的扯淡呢
five minutes ago?

739
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,110
哈羅德
Harold.

740
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,830
看來你的時間到了  哈羅德打算開口了
Looks like you're out of time. Harold's ready to talk.

741
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,850
你有沒有什么想先說的
You want to tell me something first?

742
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,870
在他改變主意之前趕緊去見他
Get to him before he changes his mind.

743
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,160
-我要求見我的當事人  -你可以見
- I demand to see my client. - You can see him,

744
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,370
但我不會放了他  因為五分鐘后
but I'm not letting him go, 'cause in five minutes,

745
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,410
我就會回來給他致命一擊
I'm gonna come back to him with a sledgehammer.

746
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,520
別急
Not so fast.

747
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,810
我要求見我的當事人
I demand to see my client,

748
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,570
我當事人不是邁克·羅斯  是哈羅德·甘德森
and my client isn't Mike Ross, it's Harold Gunderson.

749
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,150
-你是  -路易·利特  皮爾遜-斯佩克特的
- And you are? - Louis Litt, Pearson Specter.

750
00:31:36,560 --> 00:32:36,560
人人影視
YYeTs.com

751
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,420
你是說他現在被控與之合謀的
You're telling me that a man who works at the law firm

752
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,140
那個律所的雇員恰好就是他的律師
he's accused of colluding with just happens to be his attorney?

753
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,550
正是如此
That's exactly what I'm saying.

754
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,980
-你扯淡  -我沒有
- Bullshit. - No.

755
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,550
扯淡的是你居然以為哈羅德·甘德森
What's bullshit is you thinking it's up to you

756
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,510
選誰做代理律師是由你說了算的
who gets to represent Harold Gunderson.

757
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,170
所以如果我走進那個房間
So if I walk in there right now

758
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,520
問他誰是他的律師  他會說是你嗎
and ask him who his attorney is, he's gonna say it's you?

759
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,900
他說什么不重要
Doesn't matter what he says.

760
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,680
根據第407條法規  如果你不讓我見我的當事人
It's 407, and if you don't let me see my client,

761
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,240
此刻開始他說的所有話都不可采納為證詞
anything he says after this second will be inadmissible.

762
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,700
而我會用第四修正案
And I will rain down fourth amendment claims on you

763
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,700
第四修正案禁止不合理的搜查和抓捕

764
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,440
追著你告一輩子
for the rest of your goddamn life.

765
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,960
如果你想自己休息一會  只管開口
If you wanted some me time, all you had to do was ask.

766
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,270
你最好告訴我點好消息
You'd better have some good news for me,

767
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,070
不然我就要休息很久了
otherwise I'm gonna be having plenty of me time.

768
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,460
哈維  這個叫伍德爾的家伙是來真的
Harvey, this Woodall guy is serious.

769
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,190
-我也是來真的  -那我為什么還呆在這兒
- I'm serious too. - Then why am I still in here?

770
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,390
因為我們在等路易
Because we're waiting for Louis.

771
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,660
路易  他要干什么
Louis? To do what?

772
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,640
說服哈羅德別開口
Convince Harold not to talk.

773
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,440
我了個去  路易和哈羅德在一起
Holy shit. Louis is in with Harold?

774
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,630
哈羅德討厭路易
Harold hates Louis!

775
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,260
這是最好的辦法了
It's our best shot.

776
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,310
那我們現在干什么
So what do we do now?

777
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,630
等著
We wait.

778
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,500
路易  你來干什么
Louis, what are you doing here?

779
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,830
首先  你怎么樣了
First off, how you doing?

780
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,430
你覺得我怎么樣了
How do you think I'm doing?

781
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,640
我已經下到地獄第七層了
I'm in the seventh circle of hell.

782
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,230
騎士來拯救你了
Well, the cavalry has arrived.

783
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,450
我不需要騎士  我要出去
I don't need the cavalry. I've decided to get out.

784
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,260
哈羅德   你不能簽協議
Okay, Harold, you cannot sign a deal.

785
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,280
簽了你就再也不能當律師了
You'll never work as a lawyer again.

786
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,930
你在乎嗎  我當律師的時候是你炒了我
What do you care? You fired me as a lawyer.

787
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,370
現在你有求于我
Now all of a sudden you're my best friend

788
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,540
就突然變成我的摯友了  見鬼去吧  路易
when you need something from me? Go to hell, Louis!

789
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,210
知道嗎
Okay, you know what?

790
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,730
你說得對
You're right.

791
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,890
我不是你的朋友  從來不是
I'm not your friend. Never was.

792
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,690
但我從未欺騙過你
But the one thing I've never done is lie to you.

793
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,010
你現在有機會毫發無傷地走出這道門
Now, you have a chance to walk out of here today,

794
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,880
好像什么事都沒發生過一樣
as if none of this has ever happened,

795
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,890
只要你相信我
and all you have to do is trust me.

796
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,550
你根本不明白他是怎樣的人
You have no idea who that man is.

797
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,740
不明白
No idea?

798
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,170
那你以為我怎么進來的
How do you think I got in the room?

799
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,860
好吧  路易
Okay, well, you know, Louis,

800
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,500
很高興你能認真對待這件事
I am glad you got to take a good look at it,

801
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,500
因為如果我不供出邁克
because if I don't give them Mike,

802
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,200
我就要在這呆一輩子了
I could be in here for the rest of my life.

803
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,320
律師光看著窗外是領不到工資的
Lawyers don't get paid to look out the window.

804
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,180
我也無法集中注意力
I can't concentrate either.

805
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,190
我只是希望能盡一份力
I just wish there was something we could do.

806
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,880
瑞秋  如果這個案子上了法庭
Rachel, if this thing moves forward to trial,

807
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,050
我會不遺余力去贏
I will do everything in my power to win.

808
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,010
但離比賽結束只有兩分鐘了
But there's two minutes left in the game,

809
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,990
而我們最好的隊員都在場上
and our star players are on the field.

810
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,010
所以現在  我們只能選擇相信他們
So right now, we just have to have faith.

811
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,200
我們
W-we?

812
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,810
我們
We.

813
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,530
你會在這里工作
You're going to work here.

814
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,610
我們會成為一家人
We're going to be family.

815
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,910
而了解家人的最好辦法就是當他們愛的人
And the way to get to know your family is by being with them

816
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,450
遇到麻煩時陪在他們身邊
when their loved ones are in trouble.

817
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,680
我們要等多久
How long do we wait?

818
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,890
等到一切結束
As long as it takes.

819
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,430
我想跟你談談我的辯護策略
I want to talk to you about my defense strategy.

820
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,740
這就是你的辯護策略
This is your defense strategy.

821
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,730
如果不管用
If this doesn't work,

822
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,690
你就去找別的律師談吧
you're gonna want to talk to a different lawyer than me.

823
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,610
哈維  我不管哈羅德跟他們說了什么
Harvey, I don't care what Harold gives them on me,

824
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,100
我不會出賣你的
I'm not giving them you.

825
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,260
-我想跟你講個故事  -我不想聽故事
- I want to tell you a story. - I don't want to hear a story.

826
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,060
是關于我跟我爸說我媽的事
It's about the time I decided to tell my dad about my mom.

827
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,820
你還記得我跟你說過些什么嗎
You remember what I told you about her?

828
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,760
-哈維  -我當時20歲
- Harvey-- - I was 20,

829
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,030
離家在外
out of the house,

830
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,650
我跟我媽說只要她別帶人回家
and I told her I would never tell him

831
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,790
我就不會告訴我爸
as long as she never brought anyone--

832
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,010
有一天我回家洗衣服  然后我聽到了
I came home to do laundry one day, and I heard--

833
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,120
我聽到了
I heard,

834
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,780
然后我還看到了  那天晚上我就跟我爸說了
and then I saw, and I told him that night.

835
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,400
因為有時候說出來會更好
Because sometimes it's better to tell.

836
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,250
她那是活該
She deserved that.

837
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,360
我也是
So do I.

838
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,120
這一切都是我的主意
This whole thing was my idea.

839
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,560
是我做的決定  伍德爾的目標是我
I gave the go-ahead. It's me Woodall wants.

840
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,520
-他的目標不是你  -不  就是我
- Well, he's not getting you! - Yes, he is.

841
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,170
不  不管那間屋子里發生了什么
No, I don't care what happens in that room,

842
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,260
我不會放棄你的
I'm not giving you up!

843
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,980
-別傻了  -別混了
- Don't be a fool. - Don't be an asshole!

844
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,690
聽我說  該死的  我允許你
Listen to me, God damn it, I'm giving you permission--

845
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,870
我才不管你要給我什么
I don't give a shit what you're giving me!

846
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,640
我雇了個騙子
I hired a fraud.

847
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,610
我們在克利福德·丹納案上越過了底線
And then we crossed the line with Clifford Danner,

848
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,450
然后是羅拉·詹森  之后是那些目擊者
then with Lola Jensen, and then with these witnesses,

849
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,860
到最后
and to top it all off,

850
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,340
愛德華·達比的案子我們還唆使作偽證
we suborned perjury with Edward Darby.

851
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,760
真到這一關頭  你就把責任都推給我  明白嗎
If it comes to it, you point the finger at me, you got that?

852
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,770
我們就祈禱不會到這關頭吧
Let's just hope it doesn't come to it.

853
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,060
結束了  我們出去吧
It's over. Let's get the hell out of here.

854
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,380
邁克  怎么樣
Hey, Mike. How's it going?

855
00:36:36,560 --> 00:37:36,560
人人影視
YYeTs.com

856
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,710
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter!

857
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:48,720
埃里克
Eric.

858
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,860
你阻止了岡德森作證
Just because you stopped Gunderson from testifying

859
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,170
并不意味著我就會撤銷這案子
doesn't mean I'm dropping this case.

860
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,160
那就別撤銷
Then don't.

861
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,900
我要告你們惡意指控
And I'll come after you for malicious prosecution.

862
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,340
你沒有根據
You have no basis for that.

863
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,100
你們逮捕了我的當事人  他已經在這里待了4小時
You arrested my client, he was here four hours,

864
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,040
沒有任何記錄顯示你們聯系過我
and you have no log with an outgoing call to me,

865
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,250
完全根據捏造的恐怖主義指控
All on the basis of a fabricated terrorism claim.

866
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,090
如果這還不是惡意  那什么才是
Now, if that's not malicious, I don't know what is.

867
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,650
你隨便怎么說
You say what you want.

868
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,850
你這個無良律師  我會時刻盯著你的
You're a dirty lawyer, and now you're on my radar.

869
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,760
如果我是個無良律師
If I'm a dirty lawyer,

870
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,270
那你就是在照鏡子
then you're looking in the mirror.

871
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,070
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

872
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,260
我還以為我再也
I just thought that I would never--

873
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,670
都沒事了
Everything's gonna be okay.

874
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,780
親愛的  我到家了
Hey, honey, I'm home.

875
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,690
你有記得按我說的去接孩子嗎
Did you remember to pick up the kids like I asked?

876
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,790
記得啊
Yep.

877
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,530
最小的那個還真是棘手得很
The youngest one's turning into a real pain in the ass.

878
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,670
-你能回來真好  -回來真好
- It's good to have you back. - Good to be back.

879
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,150
你在想什么  哈維
What's on your mind, Harvey?

880
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,610
你說得對  我們正在變成愛德華
You were right. We are becoming Edward.

881
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,220
我知道
I know.

882
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,120
我們得變回我們本來的樣子
And we need to get back to being us.

883
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,440
你告訴她我們的決定了嗎
Did you let her know about our decision yet?

884
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:36,500
我以為你想親自去說
I assumed you'd want to take care of that yourself.

885
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,550
你想來一杯嗎
You want a drink?

886
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,110
《廣告狂人》上就是這么做的  對嗎
They do it on Mad Men, right?

887
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,840
杰西卡和我決定免除你的不競爭條款
Jessica and I are gonna let you out of your noncompete.

888
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,690
那入股金怎么辦
What about the buy-in?

889
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,150
入股金我們來處理
We'll take care of the buy-in.

890
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,060
哈維  我
Harvey, I, um--

891
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,180
邁克·羅斯從沒上過法學院
Mike Ross never went to law school.

892
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,490
我知道  但我還是雇了他
I knew it, and I hired him anyway.

893
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,830
你為什么現在要告訴我
Why are you telling me now?

894
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,950
因為你指責杰西卡正在變成愛德華·達比
Because you accused Jessica of being Edward Darby.

895
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,940
不是她  是我
It wasn't her. It was me.

896
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,830
我還是不能留下來  哈維
I still can't stay, Harvey.

897
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,150
我知道
I know.

898
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,070
我只是不想再欺騙我愛的人了
I just want to stop lying to the people I love.

899
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,950
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

900
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,250
我告訴她了
I told her.

901
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,240
我知道
I know.

902
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,860
-她不會告訴任何人的  -我知道
- She won't tell anyone. - I know.

903
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,550
她要走了
She's leaving.

904
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,150
我知道
I know.

905
00:41:36,560 --> 00:42:36,560
人人影視
YYeTs.com

906
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,450
哈維  你是個好人
Harvey, you're a good man.

907
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,450
是嗎
Am I?

908
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,430
我向律師協會舉報了柯靈
I turned Quelling into the bar.

909
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,030
我拿他出了氣
I took my rage out on him.

910
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,000
不該由他受這些氣
He didn't deserve it.

911
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,620
所以我撤銷了
Which is why I stopped it.

912
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,380
你在說什么呢
What are you talking about?

913
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,280
你難道真以為欠我人情的
Do you seriously think that Stephanie Liston

914
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,430
只有斯特芬尼·利斯頓一人嗎
is the only person who owes me a favor?

915
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,760
那也不會把我變成好人
Well, that doesn't make me a good man.

916
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,960
而是把你變成了好人
That makes you a good man for me.

917
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,770
哈維  有時候我們也需要一些幫助
Harvey, sometimes we need a little help.

918
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,030
今天真夠嗆
Big day.

919
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:28,910
也很恐怖
Horrible day.

920
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,770
但結局是好的
It ended well.

921
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:34,770
謝謝
Thank you.

922
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,080
你和路易真的成功了
You and Louis really came through.

923
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,760
你也是
So did you.

924
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,650
聽著  我知道你在想什么
Look, I know what you're thinking.

925
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,050
-不  你不知道  -你不想進監獄
- No, you don't. - You don't want to go to jail.

926
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,000
哈維
Harvey...

927
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,930
我今天坐在那屋子里  聽你說
I sat in that room today and listened to you tell me

928
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,300
從我們認識的那天起
that ever since the day we met,

929
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,530
你不得不越過一道
you've had to cross one line

930
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,250
-又一道底線  -邁克
- after another, and-- - Mike--

931
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,550
不  聽我說完
No, just... let me finish.

932
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,050
一開始是克利福德·丹納
First there was Clifford Danner,

933
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,260
然后是目擊證人
then the witnesses,

934
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,030
之后是唆使作偽證  更別提我們
then suborning perjury, not to mention the 17 things

935
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,490
為了阻止合并所做的17件事了
we did to stop the merger in the first place.

936
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,520
這一切  都是你雇我之后的事
All of it, since you hired me.

937
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,260
聽著  我不是那個意思
Look, that's not what I said.

938
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,400
就是這樣
Yes, it is.

939
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,010
我不是在怪你
I wasn't blaming you for those things.

940
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,190
沒關系
It doesn't matter.

941
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:33,120
我受夠了把我在乎的人置于危險境地
I'm tired of putting the people I care about in jeopardy.

942
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,650
我下午給喬納森·西德威爾打電話了
I called Jonathan Sidwell this afternoon.

943
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:44,720
我接受了那份工作
I took the job.

944
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,410
我們才剛剛渡過難關
We just got out.

945
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,120
哈維
Harvey...

946
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,910
你允許我把責任都推向你
you gave me permission to point the finger at you.

947
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,720
也允許我走吧
Give me permission to go.

948
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,320
你是個好人  哈維
You're a good man, Harvey.

949
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,370
謝謝
Thanks.

950
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,240
你什么時候走
Hey, when's your last day?

951
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,580
我不知道  怎么了
I don't know. Why?

952
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,380
我想帶你出去吃頓飯
Well, I want to take you out to dinner, you know?

953
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,720
我再也不會見你了
I'm not gonna see you anymore.

954
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,820
你還沒搞清楚  我不會真的離開
I don't think you realize, but I'm not exactly leaving.

955
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,790
西德威爾  是我們的客戶
Sidwell. You're a client.

956
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,990
就是說嚴格說來  你現在是為我工作
Which means technically, you work for me now.

957
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,400
不  我才不
No, I don't.

958
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,480
不  我才不  老板
"No, I don't, boss."

959
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,840
-別逗了  -或者"先生"
- Don't even try it. - Or "Sir."

960
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,400
哪個讓你不舒服就叫哪個
Whichever feels least comfortable.

961
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,490
既然我現在一個人工作
You know, since I'm working alone now,

962
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,490
那我就是超人了
I guess that makes me superman.

963
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,440
或者水行俠  既然你這么傻缺
Or Aquaman, seeing as you're in over your head.
