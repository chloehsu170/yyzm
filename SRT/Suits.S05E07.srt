{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,200
你咨询中途的时候走掉是因为
You walked out of our session because you didn't want

16
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,890
-你不想谈你的母亲  -你简直疯了
- to talk about your mother. - You're insane.

17
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,610
而你是个自私自利的自恋狂
And you're a self-serving narcissist

18
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,060
为了得到自己想要的东西不择手段
who will do or say anything to get what he wants.

19
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,840
是我妹妹的公司  我会把她这个客户给你
It's my sister's company. I'll give you her business.

20
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,710
而你只需解决她的离婚案
All you have to do is handle her divorce.

21
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,680
好吧
All right, I'll do it.

22
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,180
答应我你不会跟埃斯特睡
Promise me you won't sleep with esther.

23
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,380
我最不想做的事就是和你妹妹睡
The last thing I want to do is sleep with your sister.

24
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,680
今晚你还愿意带我回家吗
Would you like to take me home tonight?

25
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,760
愿意
I would.

26
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,870
弗莱彻成了杰克・索罗夫的客户
Jack Soloff signed Fletcher as a client

27
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,330
而我如今得放弃麦肯诺了
And now I have to let McKernon go.

28
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,090
很抱歉你的尴尬处境
I'm sorry you're in this position right now.

29
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,680
害你陷入这种处境的不是我
I'm not the one who put you in it.

30
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,480
是杰克・索罗夫
Jack Soloff is.

31
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,080
这是你最后一次跟我合作的机会
This is your last chance to work with me.

32
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,940
抓住机会  你还有前途
Take it and you have a future,

33
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,610
抓不住  就去丹尼尔・哈德曼那求职吧
Don't and you can go ask Daniel Hardman for a job.

34
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,630
我准备好谈我母亲了
I'm ready to talk about my mother.

35
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,530
妈妈
Mom?

36
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,980
-妈妈  -哈维
- Mom? - Harvey.

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
你...你怎么回来了
What are you-- what are you doing here?

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,160
学校让我回家
I got sent home from school.

39
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,300
我吐了
I threw up.

40
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,060
那快去躺下吧
Oh, well, let's get you to bed.

41
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,720
莉儿  我在想
Hey, Lil, I was thinking that--

42
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,210
-他是谁  -宝贝  你还记得
- Who's that? - Honey, you remember

43
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,260
我们的  我的堂兄斯考特吗
our cousin-- my cousin Scott?

44
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,900
不记得
No.

45
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,390
你当然记得  他是朱迪叔叔的兄弟
Course you do. He's Cousin Judy's brother.

46
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,100
我不太舒服
I don't feel good.

47
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,950
你发烧了
Oh, yeah, you're burning up.

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,650
快去床上躺下
Let's get you to bed.

49
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,820
别告诉爸爸斯考特叔叔的事
And let's not tell Dad about Cousin Scott.

50
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,500
好吗  他们关系不太好
Okay? 'Cause they don't get along.

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,790
来吧
Come on.

52
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,000
可怜的孩子
You poor thing.

53
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,420
"可怜的孩子"  我至今难以忘怀
"You poor thing." That's what stuck with me.

54
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,830
她嘴上虽然这么说
She said "You poor thing,"

55
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,010
而事实上她根本一点都不在乎我
but she didn't give a shit about me.

56
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,730
你那时明白自己看见的事吗
And did you know what you saw?

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,680
不  我只知道有事情不对
No, I just knew something was wrong.

58
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,200
你没有告诉你父亲
And you didn't tell your father?

59
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,970
她让我别说
She told me not to.

60
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,790
而你相信了她
And you trusted her?

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,440
是的
I did.

62
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,000
哈维  我从没想过我会对你说这句话
Harvey, I never thought I'd be saying this to you,

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,460
但我很为你骄傲
but I'm proud.

64
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,020
告诉我这些是很需要勇气的
It took an amazing amount of courage to tell me that.

65
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,270
-你不是要和我抱抱吧  -当然不
- We're not gonna hug, are we? - No, we're not.

66
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,680
但真高兴我们终于有了一次
But it does feel good to end a session

67
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,580
圆满结束的咨询
on a positive note for once.

68
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,260
在忙皮特森的案子啊
Peterson case, huh?

69
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,670
我还记得我和那混蛋打交道的时候
I remember when I used to handle that asshole.

70
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,120
有意思  我好像没请你进我办公室
Funny, I don't remember inviting you into my office.

71
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,850
对了  一定是因为
Oh, yeah, that's right, it must be because

72
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,630
那是我绝对不会做的事
it's something that I would never do.

73
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,720
迈克  我知道我阴过你和路易
Listen, Mike, I know I pulled some shit with you and Louis,

74
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,450
但现在我是来与你和解的
but I'm here to make things right with you.

75
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,860
没兴趣
Not interested.

76
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,640
听我说完
Just hear me out.

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,890
这是什么东西
What the hell is this?

78
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,510
一个为有冲基金背景的人
It's a case that's tailor-made for someone

79
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,210
量身定做的好案子
with a hedge fund background.

80
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,930
纽约教师的退休基金
New York teacher's pension fund

81
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,360
直接少了三成的年收入
just lost 30% of their annual income.

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,220
他们不经对冲就把一半资产投资了衍生品
They put half their portfolio in derivatives without hedging?

83
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,060
不是一般的衍生品  是施特劳斯银行
Not just derivatives. Derivatives created

84
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,880
为了提高收益
and marketed by Strauss Bank

85
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,700
专门创造和经营的衍生品
to increase their own revenue.

86
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,230
抱歉  杰克  我从不与我不信任的人合作
Sorry, Jack, I don't work with people that I don't trust

87
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,820
也从不相信那些连一个好理由都没有
and I don't trust somebody who comes to me saying their trying

88
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,550
就请求和解的人
to make things right without a good reason.

89
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,850
你想要理由  是杰西卡要我这么做的
You want the reason? Jessica told me to.

90
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,420
她没和我说过
Yeah, well, she didn't tell me.

91
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,790
在她说之前
And until she does...

92
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,610
你可以滚出我的办公室了
you can get out of my office.

93
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,800
西蒙案子的简报在你桌上
The Simon brief is on your desk

94
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,150
我把你周三中午的会议移到下午五点了
and I moved your Wednesday noon meeting to five.

95
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,970
为什么
Why'd you do that?

96
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,750
因为安东尼・金博尔在喝酒的时候
Because Anthony Kimball's most honest

97
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,660
最易吐真言
with a drink in him.

98
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,890
除此之外
And on top of that,

99
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,580
我也不希望你在生日这天
I wouldn't want you to have to work too hard

100
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,250
-还辛苦工作  -什么  今天不是我生日
- on your birthday. - What? It's not my birthday.

101
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,710
拜托  你可以和我说的
Oh, come on, you can tell me.

102
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,840
几岁了  48  49
What is it? 48? 49?

103
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,210
-还是六十  -首先  快六十的人可不是我
- The big 6-0? - A: I'm not the one pushing 60.

104
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,620
你最好不是在指我
You better not be talking to me.

105
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,870
其次  就算是  我也一定会找一个
B: if it were, I'd be drinking with someone

106
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,020
比安东尼・金博尔好看得多的酒伴
a lot prettier than Anthony Kimball.

107
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,480
那为什么你日历上的周三晚被
Then why is wednesday night permanently blocked out

108
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,700
永久预定了
on your calendar?

109
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,740
-唐娜  -哈维
- Donna. - Harvey.

110
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,570
-你看上去很忙啊  -因为我确实很忙
- You look busy. - I look busy because I am busy.

111
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,540
忙得都没空和我在周三晚上去戴尔波斯特吃饭了
Too busy to join me at Del Posto on wednesday night?

112
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,970
哈维  我们不用再去了
Harvey, we don't need to do that anymore.

113
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,150
那你为什么
Then why did you leave it

114
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,660
要在我日历上永久预定这一天
permanently blocked off on my calendar?

115
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,110
因为那是我很久以前做的事
Because I did that a long time ago

116
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,530
而我离开时忘记取消了
and when I left your desk I forgot to undo it.

117
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,120
那我们为什么索性当做你是故意
Then why don't we pretend that you forgot

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,550
没有取消的呢
to undo it on purpose?

119
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,340
我不再为你工作了
I don't work for you anymore.

120
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,710
还庆祝什么
What would we be celebrating?

121
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,510
虽然不能再庆祝你来为我工作的纪念日
Instead of celebrating the day you came to my desk,

122
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,930
我们来庆祝下
how about we celebrate...

123
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,470
和平共处两周吧
two weeks of being on decent terms?

124
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,100
但刚过了一周半
It's only been a week and a half.

125
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,750
真的吗  唐娜
Seriously, Donna?

126
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,260
我不想只是和平共处
I don't just want to be on decent terms.

127
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,960
我想继续和你当朋友
I want to get back to being friends.

128
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,560
那真的很好  哈维
That's really nice, Harvey.

129
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,920
周三晚上见
See you Wednesday night.

130
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,410
谢谢
Thank you.

131
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,430
杰西卡
Jessica.

132
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,080
看到你真是又惊又喜
What a pleasant surprise.

133
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,670
我们都知道那不是真的
I think we both know that it isn't.

134
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,090
-喜  还是惊  -都不是
- Pleasant? Or a surprise? - Either.

135
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,920
因为我们都知道杰克・索罗夫
Because we also both know that Jack Soloff

136
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,590
在我之前找过你
came to see you before I did.

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,540
那有什么问题吗
Is there a problem with that?

138
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,970
如果你试图和我的合伙人
There is if you're colluding

139
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,360
合谋夺取我的律所的话  就有问题
with one of my partners to take over my firm.

140
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,220
杰克来找过我
Jack came to me

141
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,420
向我请教如何搞定一个新客户
asking for advice about how to land a new client.

142
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,610
他的志在必得  让我想到了哈维的
He was so determined I was suddenly reminded

143
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,060
-第一个客户  -麦肯诺汽车公司
- of Harvey's first client. - McKernon Motors.

144
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,230
他那么在意这个客户
A client he cared so much about

145
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,670
以至于可以为了信守承诺
he gave up a promotion

146
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,950
放弃了一次升迁机会
just to keep his word.

147
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,510
这种举动很难让人忘怀
It's hard to forget a move like that.

148
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,480
你企图溜回我律所的种种行为
It's also hard to forget your history

149
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,580
也很难让人忘怀
of worming your way back into my firm.

150
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,800
如果你想给人当导师  丹尼尔
So, if you're looking for someone to mentor, Daniel,

151
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,950
去给课外辅导班上上课吧
go find yourself an afterschool program.

152
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,570
但离我的地盘远点
But stay the hell outta my house.

153
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,660
杰西卡
Jessica...

154
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,120
我对你的烂律所才没兴趣呢
I have no interest in your shitty firm

155
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,810
也用不着我进入你的地盘摧毁它
and I don't have to enter your house to damage it.

156
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,540
在你放弃弗莱彻引擎公司时
You did that all by yourself

157
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,470
就已亲自完成了这个任务
the second you let Fletcher Engines go.

158
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,380
杰克告诉你的吗
Jack tell you that?

159
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,450
弗莱彻引擎公司告诉了所有人
Fletcher Engines told everyone that.

160
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,620
你也告诉你整个律所比起他们
And you told your entire firm that you care more about

161
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,000
你更在乎哈维・斯佩克特
Harvey Specter than you do about them.

162
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,030
失陪了  我有个会
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting

163
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,890
要在我的新办公室开
in my new office.

164
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,470
回到这个城市感觉太好了
It's so nice to be back in the city.

165
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,290
收拾你的东西  滚出我的律所
Clean out your things and get the hell out of my firm.

166
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,100
-什么  -我给了你最后的机会
- What? - I gave you one last chance

167
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,500
而你搞砸了
to play nice, and you blew it.

168
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,970
-我怎么搞砸了  -你是要否认
- How did I blow it? - Oh, you're going to deny

169
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,320
你在公司散播消息
that you've been spreading word around the office

170
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,150
说我让你放弃弗莱彻引擎公司吗
that I told you to drop Fletcher Engines?

171
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,520
是的  我否认  因为我没说过
Yes. I'm gonna deny it, because I didn't do it.

172
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,370
那其他人怎么知道的
Then how the hell does everybody know?

173
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,510
因为我签下弗莱彻的时候告诉他们了
Because I told them when I signed Fletcher.

174
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,360
但如果我知道你会放弃他们
Which I wouldn't have done if I'd known

175
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,660
就不会那么做
you were gonna drop them

176
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,150
因为这让我看起来很惨
Because it made me look like shit.

177
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,620
这也没让我好过
Well, it didn't make me come out smelling like a rose either.

178
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,510
你的导师好像也知道了这事
And your mentor seems to have known that.

179
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,020
他不是我的导师
He's not my mentor.

180
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,340
我去问过他的建议
I went to him for advice,

181
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,620
然后就让我差点被炒掉
and all it got me was almost getting fired.

182
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,620
但你说你会再给我一次机会
But you said you'd give me one more chance,

183
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,170
我也在努力尝试了
and I've been trying to take it.

184
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,490
举个例子
Give me one good example of that.

185
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,710
我今早去找迈克・罗斯合作
I approached Mike Ross to work with me this morning.

186
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,770
顺便提一下  他当场打了我的脸
And by the way, he spat in my face.

187
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,360
杰西卡
Jessica...

188
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,380
你表明了立场  我也听了
You made your point and I heard you.

189
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,450
如果你无论怎样都要解雇我
if you're just gonna fire me anyway,

190
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,850
当初为什么还给我机会呢
why give me the chance in the first place?

191
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,530
开玩笑  你听到我笑了吗
A joke? Uh, do you hear me laughing?

192
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,130
10%已经比你应得的多11%了
10% is 11% more than you deserve.

193
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,100
我
I--

194
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,720
怎么回事
What the hell?

195
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,270
这事最好很重要
This better be important.

196
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,220
我刚要敲定一个交易
I was just about to close a deal.

197
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,130
我听到一个传闻
I just heard a rumor

198
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,590
杰克・索罗夫刚签下了弗莱彻引擎公司
that Jack Soloff signed Fletcher Engines.

199
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,210
不可能  大家都知道如果我们签了麦肯诺
That's ridiculous--everyone knows we can't sign Fletcher

200
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,250
就不能签弗莱彻
if we represent McKernon.

201
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,860
路易  大家知道的是
I'll tell you what everyone knows, Louis.

202
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,450
杰克签了弗莱彻
Jack signed Fletcher.

203
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,460
杰西卡强迫他放弃了他们
Jessica forced him to drop them,

204
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,250
杰克当初能这么做的唯一原因
and the only reason Jack would have done that

205
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,490
就是被麦肯诺解雇了
in the first place is if you were fired by McKernon.

206
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,060
哈维  我可以解释
Harvey, I can explain.

207
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,430
天哪  我就知道
God damn it. I knew it.

208
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,080
等等  哈维  听我说
Just wait a minute. Harvey, listen to me.

209
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,680
杰克陷害了我们
Jack set us up.

210
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,110
他假装很合作
He acted as if he was cooperating

211
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,910
但其实一直在等待机会搞破坏
when all along he was looking to blow up the deal.

212
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,390
那事情发生时你为什么不来找我
Why the hell didn't you come to me when it happened?

213
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,700
因为我们想自己把问题解决
Because we wanted to fix it ourselves.

214
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,780
想自己解决
Wanting to fix it yourself

215
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,790
是你我之间所有问题的原因
is the cause of every problem you and I have ever had,

216
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,390
现在你还把这个狗屁技能教给迈克了
and now you're teaching that bullshit to Mike?

217
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,400
你知道吗  迈克和我一起合作的那个案子
You know what, mike and I worked on that deal together,

218
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,540
我们做的非常完美
and we kicked ass.

219
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,290
我很高兴  迈克也高兴  多米尼克也高兴
I'm happy, Mike's happy, Dominic's happy,

220
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,490
我可以告诉你为什么
and I'll tell you why.

221
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,980
因为我是个非常棒的律师  你也知道这点
Because I'm a damn good attorney, and you know it.

222
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,360
所以如果你来就是为了这件事
So if that's the only thing you came in here for,

223
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,010
我要去完成我的交易了
I would like to close my deal now.

224
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,310
斯佩克特先生  埃斯特・利特刚刚打来电话
Mr. Specter, Esther Litt just called.

225
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,770
她有急事  要马上见你
She has an urgent matter. Needs to see you right away.

226
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,070
她说是什么事了吗
Did she say what it was about?

227
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,110
没说  只说别告诉她哥哥
No. Just not to tell her brother.

228
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,980
原来这里就是小精灵们补充咖啡因的地方啊
Oh, so this is where the little people get their caffeine.

229
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,710
你应该不是来找早餐棒的吧
I'm guessing you're not here to have a breakfast bar.

230
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,040
我这辈子都没吃过早餐棒
I've never had a breakfast bar in my life.

231
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,520
我要谢谢你和杰克・索罗夫一起接手了
I want to thank you for taking on that pension case

232
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,740
-那个养老金案子  -我没有
- with Jack Soloff. - I didn't take on

233
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,640
和杰克・索罗夫一起接手养老金案子
the pension case with Jack Soloff.

234
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,100
-你接了  -杰西卡  别这样
- Yes, you did. - Jessica, no.

235
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,550
你不能逼我和那个人合作
You can't make me work with that man.

236
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,650
只要我想
I can make you work

237
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,350
就算是擦窗工你也得合作
with the goddamn window washers if I want to.

238
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,700
你要是不答应  就等着
And if you don't do this, you might find yourself

239
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,490
挂在外面擦五十层楼的玻璃吧
dangling 50 stories above the ground.

240
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,640
-为什么  -因为我让杰克讲和
- Why? - Because I asked Jack to make peace,

241
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,220
而他选择了你
and you're the one he chose to reach out to,

242
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,510
所以这事得你来干
so you're the one to do this.

243
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,240
我是问为什么不直接炒了他
I guess I meant why don't you just fire him?

244
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,880
要是我炒掉所有
If I fired every ambitious attorney

245
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,110
有野心挤掉我的律师
that ever took me on,

246
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,110
那这个律所里早就只剩我和哈罗德・甘德森了
there'd be nobody left here but me and Harold Gunderson.

247
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,950
等一下  你认识哈罗德・甘德森
Wait a second--you know who Harold Gunderson is?

248
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,330
所有人我都认识
I know who everybody is.

249
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,210
在你接着张口之前
And before you say one more word,

250
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,750
要是哪天我开始给所有找麻烦的人发解聘通知书
if I ever start handing out pink slips for troublemakers,

251
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,490
你绝对是第一个
you'd be the first in line.

252
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,580
好吧
Right.

253
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,420
一收到消息我就赶来了
I came here as soon as I got your message.

254
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,360
一般人可没这待遇
I don't do that for most people.

255
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,150
欲擒故纵的高手啊
So much for hard to get.

256
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,440
我们已经过了那个阶段了吧
I think we're past that.

257
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,370
杰弗里又起贪心了吗
Did Jeffrey get greedy again?

258
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,330
没有  一个名叫肯尼斯・杰克森的人
No. A man named Kenneth Jackson

259
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,040
声称我的无坚果蛋糕
is claiming my nut-free muffins

260
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,080
导致他过敏性休克了
put him in anaphylactic shock.

261
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,000
怎么回事  麦麸放多了
What happened? Too much gluten?

262
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,670
-还是放少了  -哈维
- Not enough gluten? - Harvey,

263
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,040
这不是玩笑  它关乎我公司生存
This isn't funny. This is my company,

264
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,890
我的整个品牌都建立在质量之上
and my entire brand is based on quality.

265
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,250
抱歉  我会认真对待的
I'm sorry. I'll take it seriously.

266
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:39,930
谢谢你
Thank you.

267
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,220
别谢我  谢路易吧
Don't thank me. Thank Louis.

268
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,500
因为这个案子他来接
Because he's gonna handle this case.

269
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,820
什么
What?

270
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,770
这是公事公办  不是个人决定
This is a business matter, not personal.

271
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,430
我可不会偷走路易的客户
And I'm not stealing Louis's client.

272
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,360
你没偷走我  接手我的离婚案的就是你
You're not stealing me. You already handled my divorce.

273
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,210
你是要告诉我路易比你优秀吗
Are you gonna tell me that Louis is a better lawyer than you?

274
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,700
不  我会告诉你他是个非常棒的律师
No. I'm gonna tell you that he's a damn good lawyer,

275
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,260
而且会不惜一切保护你
and he'd do anything to project you.

276
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,380
那不是重点
That's not the point.

277
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,430
这事得低调解决
I need this to go away quietly,

278
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,120
可路易从来不会低调
and Louis doesn't do anything quietly.

279
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
-那你就让他低调  -他从来不听我的
- Then tell him that. - He never listens to me.

280
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,160
那你要么让他听  否则就换家律所吧
Then get him to listen or get another law firm,

281
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,080
因为我是不会接这个案子的
because I'm not taking this case.

282
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,660
哈维  我不需要别的律所
Harvey, I don't need another firm.

283
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,890
我需要你
I need you.

284
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,540
知道我是怎么想的吗
You know what I think?

285
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,350
我觉得你是想再跟我约会
I think you want to go out with me again,

286
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,650
然后用这事把我找来
and you came to me with this

287
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,090
因为你不敢跟我直说
because you're afraid to say it to me.

288
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,270
难以置信
I don't believe you!

289
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,590
你觉得我会策划一起针对我自己公司的诉讼
You think I concocted a lawsuit against my own company

290
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,490
就为了告诉一个已经和我在一起的男人
just to tell a man I've already been with

291
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,760
我喜欢他
that I like him?

292
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,480
看起来就是这样
Sure looks that way.

293
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,840
那样的话
In that case,

294
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,320
看来我的确找错了人
I guess I do have the wrong man for the job.

295
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,650
多谢你花时间过来
Thank you for taking the time.

296
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,640
请告诉他我来了
Please let him know I'm here.

297
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
埃斯特
Esther.

298
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,690
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

299
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,710
我昨天说的很清楚了
I thought I was very clear yesterday.

300
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,030
我不会接你的案子
I'm not taking your case.

301
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,280
你的确说得很清楚
You were clear.

302
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,390
我是来找路易的
I'm here to see Louis.

303
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,080
但很高兴见到你还是一如既往的自负
But it's nice to see your ego's as strong as ever.

304
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,670
对不起  昨天我说话太混了
I'm sorry...and I didn't mean to be such a dick yesterday.

305
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,110
没关系  哈维  我懂你的用心
It's okay, Harvey. I know what you did.

306
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,400
你用你口中的罪名指责我
You accused me of what you accused me of,

307
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,720
这样我就会来找路易了
so I will go to Louis.

308
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,590
所以你不生我的气
So you're not mad at me?

309
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,530
其实还有点甜蜜
It was actually sweet...

310
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,130
虽然方法有点混蛋
in a dick-ish sort of way.

311
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,090
那是我的特长
That's my specialty.

312
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,750
谢谢你  哈维
Thanks, Harvey.

313
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,000
你好  埃斯特  我是唐娜・鲍尔森
Hi, Esther, I'm Donna Paulsen.

314
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,990
-我是...  -我知道你是谁
- I'm the-- - I know who you are.

315
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,710
你是我哥哥有生以来
You're the best thing

316
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,060
对他最好的恩赐
that's ever happened to my brother.

317
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,040
你知道的还太少
Oh. Well, you don't know the half of it.

318
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,690
但我希望没因为我的紧急通知
Anyway, I hope I didn't put you to too much trouble

319
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,670
-给你带来麻烦  -没有的事
- on short notice. - Oh, nonsense.

320
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,350
路易听说你要来激动死了
Louis was thrilled when he heard you were coming in.

321
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,450
到底是什么重要的事
What was so goddamn important

322
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,880
让我得空出整个上午
that I had to cancel my entire morning?

323
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,590
我发誓他非常乐意
I swear he was happy to do it.

324
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,640
等你要办的事一办完
And you and I are having lunch

325
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,070
我们俩就去吃午饭
the second whatever it is you're here for is over.

326
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,330
-要喝一口吗  -那是李子泥吗
- Want a sip? - Is that a prunie?

327
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,370
不喝  你居然还喝那破玩意儿
No! I can't believe you still drink that crap.

328
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,250
你明知道我和格蒂奶奶一样有结肠痉挛
You know I've got Grandma Gertie's spastic colon.

329
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,110
你到底来干什么
What he hell are you doing here?

330
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,860
有人起诉我
I'm being sued.

331
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,290
天哪
Holy shit.

332
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,940
你那该死的松饼确实让人感染沙门氏菌了
Your shitty muffins really did give someone salmonella.

333
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,270
不是沙门氏菌
It's not salmonella,

334
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,700
还有路易  这事很严肃
and Louis, this is serious.

335
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,910
-事关我的公司  -好吧  抱歉
- It's my company. - All right, I'm sorry.

336
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,020
他这起诉站得住脚吗
Well, does he have a leg to stand on?

337
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,700
当然站不住
Of course not.

338
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,420
每三个月我都会审核一次所有供应商
I do an audit of every supplier every three months.

339
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,390
你确定吗  因为假如我们要
Are you sure? Because if we're gonna

340
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,480
用我们的一切力量反击他的话...
go after him with everything we've got--

341
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,100
路易  我们不会跟他打官司
Louis, we're not going after him at all.

342
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,420
我想要迅速地悄悄地把这事解决了
I want to settle this quickly and quietly.

343
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,520
埃斯特
Esther...

344
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,980
和解的话  你看起来就像是有罪了
You settle, you look guilty.

345
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,070
这是一次敲诈  简单明了
This is a shakedown, pure and simple.

346
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,760
我知道  但我不在乎
I know that, but I don't care.

347
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,110
这是一个商业决策
This is a business decision.

348
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,780
那也是为什么我试图
And that's why I'm trying

349
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,230
阻止别人干同样的事
to stop others from doing the same thing.

350
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,680
我告诉你  我知道自己在做什么
I'm telling you, I know what I'm doing.

351
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,580
我没说你不知道
I didn't say you don't.

352
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,180
是没说  你不过是在对我指手画脚而已
No, you're just telling me how to do my job.

353
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,940
路易  我过来找你是因为你是我哥哥
Louis, I came to you because you're my brother,

354
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,240
我现在就告诉你  这就是我想要的
and I am telling you, this is what I need.

355
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,100
好吧  我们和解
All right, we'll settle.

356
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,190
谢谢你  路易
Thank you, Louis.

357
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,500
不  谢谢你
No, thank you.

358
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,660
为什么
For what?

359
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,840
因为你没去找哈维
For not going to Harvey.

360
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,670
他搞定了你的离婚案
Once he handled your divorce,

361
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,840
我以为你会想要他来处理你的一切事务
I would have thought you'd want him to handle everything.

362
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,050
{\an8}杰西卡・皮尔逊
执行合伙人

363
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,880
哈维  请别拘束
Harvey, make yourself comfortable.

364
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,220
你要来杯鸡尾酒吗
Can I get you a mimosa?

365
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:20,860
不了  谢谢
No, thanks.

366
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,750
我只是顺路过来吃我的早餐百吉饼
I just stopped by to eat my morning bagel

367
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,350
并问问为何杰克・索罗夫
and ask why Jack Soloff

368
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,870
试图签下弗莱彻引擎公司
tried to sign Fletcher Engines

369
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,970
而你却没有告诉我
and you didn't tell me.

370
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,870
我没告诉你是因为我在忙着解决那事
I didn't tell you because I was busy fixing it.

371
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,900
那解决这件事是不是也包括发现他
And did fixing it involve figuring out

372
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,290
去找了丹尼尔・哈德曼
that he went to Daniel Hardman?

373
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,890
事实上  确实如此
As a matter of fact, it did.

374
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,480
你见到了哈德曼
You saw Hardman.

375
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,640
是见到了  也没花多长时间
I did, and it didn't take long,

376
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,910
因为他回到纽约了
because he's back in New York.

377
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,960
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

378
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,940
他声称自己和此事毫无关系
He said he had nothing to do with any of this.

379
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,460
没错  他说自己不过是给了杰克一些建议
Yep. He said he was just giving Jack some helpful advice.

380
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,320
我想是时候
Well, I think it's time

381
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,450
轮到我们给杰克一些有用的建议了
we gave Jack some helpful advice of our own,

382
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,590
比如你他妈快另寻高就吧
Like get your ass another job.

383
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,740
哈维  我去找了杰克
Now, Harvey, I met with Jack.

384
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,680
他说他不会再信任哈德曼了
He says he's done confiding in Hardman,

385
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,880
而我也就决定视作此事已了了
and I've decided to consider the matter closed.

386
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,620
你是在告诉我你相信那个小丑吗
You telling me you trust that clown?

387
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,900
也许我看着是很年轻
Now, I may look damn good for my age,

388
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,390
但也不是三岁小孩
but I wasn't born yesterday.

389
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,460
你想知道他和哈德曼到底有多深的牵连
You want to know how deep it goes with him and Hardman,

390
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,640
-是不是  -当然了
- don't you? - I sure as hell do.

391
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,520
这也是为什么我要迈克和杰克合作
Which is why I asked Mike to work with Jack

392
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,430
并且好好相处
and play nice,

393
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,100
而你最好别去挡道
and you better not get in the way.

394
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,390
这看起来可不像是
This doesn't look like

395
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,180
一张"原谅我这么混蛋"道歉卡啊
a "Forgive Me for Being a Dick" card.

396
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,790
本来就不是
It's not.

397
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,940
这是一本给施特劳斯银行的28页的书面质询
It's a 28-page interrogatory for Strauss Bank.

398
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,340
谢了
Thanks.

399
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,600
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

400
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,210
你告诉过我你不会和自己不信任的人共事
You told me you don't work with people you don't trust.

401
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,240
我也不会
Neither do I.

402
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,790
你不需要信任我也能明白
You don't have to trust me to understand

403
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,430
施特劳斯银行里的那些龌龊事
that the shady shit at Strauss Bank

404
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,750
是从高层开始的
starts at the top.

405
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,660
牵扯到了最高层吗
All the way to the top?

406
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,980
总裁有一半可能性知情
There's a 50-50 chance that the CEO knows.

407
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,590
而财务总监必须知情
The CFO had tohad to know.

408
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,030
我们只需要搞到他们的电邮就好了
All we have to do is get their emails.

409
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,740
那很容易
That's easy.

410
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,670
只要我们同意不提起刑事诉讼
We agree not to pursue criminal charges,

411
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,300
他们立马就会把邮件交过来了
they'll hand emails over right now.

412
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,690
我们不能放弃威胁要把他们送进监狱
We can't give up the threat of going to prison.

413
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,710
那是我们的筹码  我们必须要打官司
That's what gives us leverage. We have to go to court.

414
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,990
打官司会耗费很长时间的
Going to court will take forever.

415
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,150
我刚刚和罗伯特・赞恩争论过同样的问题
I just went through the same thing with Robert Zane.

416
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,350
你为何不打电话给他
Why don't you pick up the phone

417
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,950
问问他最后谁是对的
and ask him who turned out to be right?

418
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,650
我听说过你很自大
You know, I heard you were cocky,

419
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,190
但真没想到有这么夸张
but I had no idea.

420
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,480
是你来找我讲和的
You're the one who came to me looking to make peace.

421
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,780
你到底还要不要和平共处了
You wanna make peace or not?

422
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,830
好吧  我们试试你的方法
All right. We'll try it your way.

423
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,130
瑞秋  有什么需要我帮助的吗
Rachel, what can I do for you?

424
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,310
我听说了埃斯特的事
I heard about Esther,

425
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,230
希望能帮上点忙
and I was hoping I could help.

426
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,190
谢谢你的好意
I appreciate the offer,

427
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,840
但我打算自己解决这件事
but I'm gonna take care of this one myself.

428
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,370
我不是想要打扰你什么的
And I'm not trying to interfere.

429
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,650
我只是想着假如能向我们这里
I just thought it would be nice to learn

430
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,090
最有才  最勤奋
from the most talented, diligent,

431
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,670
最受人尊重的合伙人学习就好了
and respected partner that we have here.

432
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,280
是啊  你不过是想拍我马屁罢了
Yeah, you're just trying to butter me up.

433
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,290
成功了吗
Is it working?

434
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,010
帅哥
Handsome.

435
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,620
听我说
Listen to me.

436
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,120
她是我妹妹
She's my sister.

437
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,840
有人告了他
She's being sued.

438
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,300
上次她遇到麻烦时  她去向哈维求助
Last time she had a problem, she went to Harvey,

439
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,350
但这次她向我求助了
but this time she's coming to me,

440
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,800
所以我不会让任何人插手这件事的
and I'm not gonna farm any of it out.

441
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
你能理解吗
Can you understand that?

442
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,770
我想要参与这个案子的
The reason I want on this case

443
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,410
是因为我崇拜埃斯特和她的公司
is that I admire Esther and her company,

444
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,470
所以假如有人用一个荒唐的官司欺负她的话
And if someone's coming at her with a frivolous lawsuit,

445
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,390
再小的忙我也愿意帮
then...I don't care how little I do.

446
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,930
我只是想帮你
I just want to help you.

447
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,440
文件就在这里
Paperwork's right here.

448
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,320
法官大人  如您所见
Your Honor, as you can see,

449
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,810
这往轻了说是工作疏忽
there's been clear negligence at best,

450
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,480
-往重了说是蓄意行骗  -更不用说
- deliberate deception at worst. - Not to mention

451
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,460
还违反了诚信义务
a breach of fiduciary duty.

452
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,760
我赞同你的观点
I'm inclined to agree.

453
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,270
法官大人  唯一明确的一点
Your Honor, the only thing that's clear

454
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,060
是他的客户选择风险投资
is his clients chose a risky investment.

455
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,530
这可不是欺诈
That's not deception on our part.

456
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,770
他推出这些衍生产品  明知道风险很高
The deception is he created those derivatives,

457
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,950
还是卖给我们  这就是欺诈
he knew how risky they were, and he sold them to us anyway.

458
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,100
我有二十亿投资基金
I have $2 billion in investment funds.

459
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,450
你觉得我每笔投资都会过目吗
You think I review every investment?

460
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,300
不知道  但你绝对看了这笔
I don't know, but you sure as hell reviewed this one.

461
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,470
-证据呢  -目前还没有
- And where's your proof? - We don't have any...yet.

462
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,700
所以我们请求查阅他们的邮件
Which is why we're requesting access to these emails.

463
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,300
这里讨论的不是查阅邮件
This isn't about getting their emails.

464
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,970
而是是否要开庭
This is about determining if trial's moving forward.

465
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,940
结论是要
And it is.

466
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,690
我会在三周后就查阅邮件一事
I'll set the email discovery hearing

467
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,680
-召开听证会  -三周
- for three weeks. - Three weeks?

468
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,350
法官大人
Uh, Your Honor,

469
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,580
我妻子三周后要动手术
my wife has surgery in three weeks.

470
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,100
我申请再延期一个月
I'd like to request an additional month.

471
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,190
还动手术  扯淡呢
Bullshit she has surgery.

472
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,360
预定在哥伦比亚长老教会医学中心剖腹产
Scheduled C-section at Columbia Presbyterian.

473
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,790
那就换个人负责这个案子
Then put someone else on the case.

474
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,830
-事情不是这么干的  -容我说一句
- That's not how it works. - If I may...

475
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,820
如果我们同意不就此进行刑事指控
If we agree not to pursue criminal charges in this matter,

476
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,050
你们会在一周内提供邮件吗
will you give us the emails within the week?

477
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,610
你现在当场同意
You agree to that right here,

478
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,980
我明天就把邮件给你
I'll give 'em to you tomorrow.

479
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,130
一言为定
Then we have a deal.

480
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,710
想告诉我你拿了什么回扣吗
Wanna tell me what kind of kickback you're getting?

481
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,130
-你说什么  -你背着我行事
- Excuse me? - You went behind my back.

482
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,350
我没背着你做任何事
I didn't do anything behind your back.

483
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,290
我是当着你的面做的
I did it in front of your face.

484
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,940
你知道我在说什么  你放弃了我们的筹码
You know what I mean-- you gave up on leverage

485
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,890
给了他一张免罪通行证
by handing him a get out of jail free card,

486
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,150
这说明你要么是他们一伙的
which means you're either in their pocket

487
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,050
要么就是在利用这个案子
or you're using this case

488
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,620
好等事情结束后跟他们签约
so you can sign them once it's over.

489
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,700
-你说什么  -你听得很清楚
- What did you just say to me? - You heard me.

490
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,670
你跟他握手那样子  就像他是你亲戚似的
You shook that guy's hand like you were his goddamn cousin.

491
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,020
听好了  如果他们想做我的客户
You listen to me. If they wanted to be my client,

492
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,970
我会接  但我那么做
I'd take them. But I didn't do that

493
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:36,840
不是为了拍他马屁
to kiss his ass.

494
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,090
我那么做是为了得到我们需要的东西
I did it to get what we needed.

495
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,620
我们已经有了
We already had what we needed.

496
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,510
不  没有
No, we didn't.

497
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,420
听证会七个礼拜后才召开
We had a hearing on it in seven weeks,

498
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,030
那该死的剖腹产只是冰山一角
and that C-section bullshit was just the tip of the iceberg.

499
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,940
在此期间  他们会想出别的办法
Between now and then, they'd have figured out a way

500
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,400
再把听证会推迟个两年
to put it off for another two years.

501
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,370
-这可未必  -绝对是这样
- You don't know that. - Yes, I do.

502
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,680
我说过会按你的方法试试  但行不通
I said I would try it your way, and it didn't work.

503
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,360
现在邮件就要来了
Well, now those emails are coming.

504
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,200
你要不要帮我
Are you gonna help me or not?

505
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,350
路易  我得跟你谈谈  有麻烦了
Louis, I need to talk to you--we have a problem.

506
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,640
-什么麻烦  -麻烦是
- What's wrong? - What's wrong

507
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,870
肯尼斯・杰克森的律师
is Kenneth Jackson's lawyer.

508
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,140
她叫莉斯贝・韦克斯勒
Her name's Lisbeth Wexler,

509
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,580
这不是她的第一件恶意诉讼
and this isn't her first frivolous suit.

510
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,720
这些人都是这样
Well, it never is with these people.

511
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
这不意味着我们不能和解
That doesn't mean we can't settle.

512
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,790
好吧  你不明白
Okay. You don't understand.

513
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,180
我调查了她经手的数十件案子
I went through dozens of her cases.

514
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,420
每次她拿到开价
Every time she gets an offer,

515
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,430
就威胁说要公之于众
she threatens to go public with it.

516
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,780
-该死  -怎么了
- Shit. - What?

517
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,640
我怕的就是这个
That's exactly what I was afraid of.

518
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,890
好吧  那你该知道  这没什么大不了
Okay, well, then you know it's not a big deal.

519
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,180
我们搞得定  但我们不能开价
We can handle it, but we can't give them an offer.

520
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,120
不  你不明白
No, you don't understand.

521
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,690
我告诉过埃斯特可能会发生这种事
I tried to tell Esther this might happen,

522
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,730
可她逼我保证
but then she made me promise

523
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,560
我得不惹麻烦把事情摆平
that I would make this thing go away without any trouble.

524
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,700
好吧  如果我们不做点什么  选择和解
Okay, well, if we don't do something other than settle,

525
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,810
她的麻烦可就大了
she's in for a hell of a lot more trouble.

526
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,450
他没这么说
He didn't really say that.

527
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,480
他不仅这么说了  我还得跟着录音机
Oh, not only did he say it, but I had to transcribe it

528
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,040
逐字逐句抄录下来
word for word off his dictaphone.

529
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,750
-怎么了  -我刚意识到
- What? - No, I just realized

530
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,140
我已经两个小时没有去想
I haven't thought about Jack Soloff

531
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,190
杰克・索罗夫和他的破事了
and his bullshit for two hours.

532
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,960
真高兴我们出来吃饭了  哈维
Glad we did this, Harvey.

533
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,680
我也是  我们应该多出来玩玩
Me, too. We should do it more often.

534
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,100
我不知道米歇尔会怎么想
Well, I'm not sure how Mitchell would feel about that.

535
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,160
米歇尔是谁
Who's Mitchell?

536
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,400
我这六周以来
He's the man that I've been seeing

537
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,700
一直在跟他约会
for the last six weeks.

538
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,860
他...
He's...

539
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,510
他很聪明  风趣
He's smart and he's funny and...

540
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,270
最重要的是  他跟律师行业一点关系都没有
Best of all, he has nothing to do with the practice of law.

541
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,610
我真为你高兴  唐娜
I'm happy for you, Donna.

542
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,790
谢谢
Thanks.

543
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,460
我之所以告诉你
And the reason I told you

544
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,520
是想让你知道我没吃醋
is so that you'll know that I'm not jealous

545
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,670
我想说
when I say...

546
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,690
你得告诉路易
you need to tell Louis

547
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,330
你一直在跟埃斯特上床
you've been sleeping with Esther.

548
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,370
-什么  -得了
- What? - Oh, please.

549
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,170
我今早看到你俩在那里相互对视
It took me all of two seconds to put it together

550
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,660
不出两秒我就想明白了
after I saw you two mooning over each other this morning.

551
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,840
不是你想的那样
It's not what you think.

552
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,910
我处理她的离婚诉讼时  我们相处融洽
We bonded together during her divorce proceedings.

553
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,250
哈维  你说你想跟我做朋友
Harvey, you said you wanted to be friends.

554
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,940
我这么做就是做朋友该做的事
This is me being your friend.

555
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,750
朋友才不会污蔑对方
Friends don't accuse each other of things.

556
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,870
我没有污蔑你  我是想帮你
I'm not accusing you. I'm looking out for you.

557
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,010
这怎么会是帮我
How is that looking out for me?

558
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,450
因为  我说了  你必须告诉他
Because, like I said, you need to tell him.

559
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,630
告诉你  我不用这么做
Well, you know what? I don't need to do that

560
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,980
因为这次  你感觉错了
because, for once, your radar is off.

561
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,350
我没一直跟她上床
We haven't been sleeping together.

562
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,650
我们只睡了一次
We slept together one time.

563
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,500
有什么区别呢
What difference does that make?

564
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,160
你向他承诺了你不会这么做
You promised him you wouldn't do it at all.

565
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,710
唐娜  路易心情好的时候
Donna, Louis isn't rational on his best days

566
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,310
对待与他妹妹无关的事情都不理智
with issues that don't involve his sister,

567
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,660
如果我按你说的做了他会作何反应
Now, how is he going to take it if I do what you're asking?

568
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,810
那你觉得如果被他发现
And how do you think he's gonna react

569
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,130
你做了这事还瞒着他他又会作何反应
when he finds out you kept this from him?

570
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,300
-他不会发现的  -他会的
- He's not gonna find out. - Yes, he is.

571
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,590
是个人都能看得出你俩
Because I didn't have to be me to see the way

572
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,930
对视的时候含情脉脉
you two looked at each other.

573
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,150
总有一天路易也会看出来
And someday Louis is gonna see that, too.

574
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,040
唐娜  我很感激你作为朋友提的建议
Donna, I appreciate you telling me this as a friend.

575
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,900
现在作为朋友  我也告诉你
Now, as a friend, I'm telling you

576
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,420
管好你自己的事就行
to mind your own business.

577
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,900
我说对了  你跟他们做了边线交易
I was right. You cut them some side deal.

578
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,520
你在说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

579
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,670
我看了他们所有的邮件
I went through all their emails

580
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,840
但没有找到任何把柄
and I found them nothing tying them to anything.

581
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,500
也就是说你早知道他们会隐瞒一些邮件
Which means you knew they would leave some emails out

582
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,150
而你利用此事想从中牟利
and you let it go to get something out of it.

583
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,940
我并不知道他们会隐瞒邮件
I didn't know they would leave anything out,

584
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,100
但我确实认为他们会如此
but I thought they might

585
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,720
我也确实打算利用此事
and I am gonna get something out of it,

586
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,920
但并非你想的那样
but it's not what you think.

587
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,830
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

588
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,180
你以进监狱威胁他们是对的
Your idea of threatening prison was right,

589
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,040
但从来就没有人曾因为
but nobody ever went to jail

590
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,780
销售劣质证券入狱过
for selling shitty securities.

591
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,790
但可以以销毁证据的罪名起诉他们
They go to jail for destroying evidence.

592
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,880
所以  我没有选择向几位
So, instead of proving to some jury

593
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,200
不懂证券法的陪审团成员
that doesn't understand securities law

594
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,210
解释他们早知道这个投资的风险
that these guys knew the risks of their investments--

595
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,610
只要我们证明他们删除了邮件就行
All we have to do is prove they deleted some emails.

596
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,670
对不起
I'm sorry.

597
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,770
请坐
Take a seat.

598
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,750
这可是你两天来第二次
You know that's the second time in two days

599
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,690
贸然断定我是坏人了
that you jumped right to me being the bad guy?

600
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,390
你得承认  在我和路易
Well, you have to admit, my experience

601
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,570
和你的接触中
with how you treated me and louis

602
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,070
你扮演的就是坏人的角色
was you being the bad guy.

603
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,830
有道理
Fair enough.

604
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,600
但你又知道路易当面骗我说
But were you there when Louis lied to my face

605
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
要在一个会议中支持我的事吗
about backing me in a meeting?

606
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,910
你又知道他骗杰西卡
Or when he told Jessica

607
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,290
把他自己干的坏事安在我头上
that I did something awful that he, in fact, did?

608
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,750
我不知道
No, I wasn't.

609
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,230
但你也了解他
But you do know him

610
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,050
你知道他能做出什么事来
and what he's capable of.

611
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,510
但你还是做到了和他和睦相处
And you're somehow on good terms with him.

612
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,590
我能跟他和睦相处
I'm on good terms with him

613
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,300
是因为我见过他好的一面
because I've seen other sides of him.

614
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,840
我也有好的一面
Well, I have other sides, too.

615
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,490
也许我是在律所耍了些龌龊手段
I may have done some office backstabbing,

616
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,890
但我从来没干过什么让你觉得
but I have never done anything to indicate to you

617
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,420
我会犯法的事吧
that I would do something illegal.

618
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,290
而这正是你今天对我的指责
Which is what you came in here accusing me of.

619
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,740
好吧  杰克
Okay, Jack.

620
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,670
我给你一个机会向我展示你好的一面
You can have a chance to show me another side of yourself, too.

621
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,450
我说了让你和解
I told you to settle this thing!

622
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,590
我也想和解啊
And I'm trying to.

623
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,530
那我为什么得到通知说食品及药物管理局
Then why did I just get a notice that the FDA

624
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,150
要调查我的公司
is investigating my company?

625
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,480
-什么  -你干了什么
- What? - What did you do?

626
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,060
我本来是要和解  但瑞秋发现
I was gonna settle, but then Rachel found out

627
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,920
他们的律师经常勒索公司
their lawyer has history of blackmailing companies

628
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,530
所以我只能反诉他了
so our only option was to counter-sue.

629
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,590
你违背了我的明确指示进行了反诉
You filed a counter-suit against my explicit instructions?

630
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,780
埃斯特  是你来找我帮忙
You know what, Esther? You came to me for help,

631
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,400
而我也不会在做松饼的事上对你指手画脚
and I don't tell you how to bake your muffins.

632
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,440
因为你并不了解我的生意的第一要务
Because you don't know the first thing about my business.

633
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,600
而你也不懂我这行的第一要务
And you don't know the first thing about mine.

634
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,390
我不需要懂  我了解你就够了
I don't have to. I know you.

635
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,300
你就是心里埋着满满的
And you've got a chip on your shoulder

636
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,820
自卑感  一旦触发
the size of Montana and when it comes out,

637
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,160
你就会把所有事都搞砸
you make everything worse.

638
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,830
我告诉你  埃斯特
You know what, Esther?

639
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,590
我这么做没有错
I was right to do what I did.

640
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,550
而且这次  我不要接受
And, for once, I'm not gonna let you

641
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,180
你这副居高临下的样子
treat me like I'm less than you.

642
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,500
我对你居高临下
Less than me?

643
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,930
没错  你就是有
Yes, less than you!

644
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,530
我从来都是你的傻哥哥
I'm always your buffoon brother.

645
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,640
这次我决不允许
Well, not this time.

646
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,540
你根本没有权利不跟我商量就这么做
You had no right to do this without asking me!

647
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,130
我不跟你商量是因为你肯定不听我的
I didn't ask you because you wouldn't have listened.

648
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,380
是你从来不听我说话
No, you never listen!

649
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,250
所以我一开始才想去找哈维
Which is why I wanted to go to Harvey in the first place!

650
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,370
-什么  -你没听错
- What? - You heard me.

651
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,820
你怎么可以这样背叛我
How could you betray me like that?

652
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,880
我没有背叛你
I wasn't betraying you.

653
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,200
我只是为自己考虑
I was looking out for myself.

654
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,080
如果你是为了自己考虑
If you were looking out for yourself,

655
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,710
那为什么又骗我说你没去找他
then why did you lie to me about going to him?

656
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,970
因为你一定会嫉妒
Because you're always jealous

657
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,510
只要我去找别人帮忙
whenever I ask anyone else to do anything.

658
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,540
你是我哥哥  路易  不是我男朋友
You're my brother, Louis, not my boyfriend.

659
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,200
你这么想用哈维  你现在就可以去找他
If you wanted Harvey so much, why don't you go to him right now?

660
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,690
我不能
I can't.

661
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,130
因为我去找他的时候
Because when I went to him,

662
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,460
他跟我说我应该信任你
he told me I should trust you.

663
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,460
-他真这么说了  -不仅如此
- He really said that? - He didn't just say that.

664
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,850
他说你是个出色的律师
He said you were a damn good lawyer.

665
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,370
我是个出色的律师
I am a damn good lawyer.

666
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,310
但我确实应该提前告诉你的
But I should have told you.

667
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,930
那么...
Well...

668
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,020
我们现在该怎么办
What are we gonna do now?

669
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,630
那取决于你是不是信任我
That depends on if you think you can trust me or not.

670
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,980
我信任你
I can.

671
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,930
-早上好  路易  -早上好
- Morning, Louis. - Good morning.

672
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,590
你去哪了  我都给你发了八百条短信了
Where the hell were you? I text you like 18 times.

673
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,460
是的  如果真的有紧急情况
Yes, and if it had been an emergency,

674
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,330
我就会给你回电话的
I would have called you back.

675
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,300
那确实是紧急情况
It was an emergency.

676
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,540
路易  曲别针用完了可不叫紧急情况
Louis, running out of paper clips is not an emergency.

677
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,200
我知道  只是我...
I know, it's just that I...

678
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,750
需要你的时候  却找不到你
needed you, and I couldn't reach you,

679
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,500
这种情况从来没发生过
and that's never happened before.

680
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,770
我和哈维吃晚餐去了
I was having dinner with Harvey.

681
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,520
-哈维  -是的
- Harvey? - Yes.

682
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,170
我们希望继续保持朋友关系
We're trying to stay friends.

683
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,160
-朋友  -是的  只是朋友
- Friends? - Yes, friends.

684
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,000
我不会回去为他工作的  路易
I'm not going back to him, Louis.

685
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,300
什么  这我知道
What? I know that.

686
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,960
晚餐怎么样
How'd it go?

687
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,600
还不错
It was fine.

688
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,210
他没有碰巧提起埃斯特吧
He didn't happen to bring up Esther, did he?

689
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,360
什么  为什么要提
What? Why would he do that?

690
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,000
因为很显然  她在来找我之前
Because apparently, she went to him

691
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,310
先去找过他
before she came to me.

692
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,120
是他帮她解决了她的离婚案
Well, he did handle her divorce.

693
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,350
我知道  只是...
I know, it's just...

694
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,170
你觉得他们两个之间
You don't think it's possible that

695
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,770
没发生什么事吧
anything happened between them, do you?

696
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,550
我不知道  路易  我是说...
I don't know, Louis, I mean...

697
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,400
我只知道我们昨晚聊了很多事
Look, I do know that we talked about a lot of things last night,

698
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,080
但并没有提到埃斯特
and Esther wasn't one of them.

699
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,930
你是对的
You're right.

700
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,710
哈维绝对不会答应了我
Harvey would never make a promise like that to me

701
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,620
然后又食言的
and then break it.

702
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,910
我很高兴你晚餐吃得很开心  唐娜
I'm glad you had a nice dinner, Donna.

703
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,770
这是什么
What the hell is this?

704
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,800
他们没有交出来的一摞电子邮件
It's a stack of emails they left out.

705
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,550
你怎么拿到的
How did you get them?

706
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,340
我怎么拿到的并不重要  重要的是我拿到了
Doesn't matter how I got them. It matters that I got them.

707
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,200
这很重要  因为如果你是非法拿到的
It does matter, because if you got them illegally,

708
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,520
那我们就不能用它们  这你是知道的
then we can't use them, and you know it.

709
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,870
我不是非法拿到的
I didn't get them illegally.

710
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,020
那你为什么不告诉我你是从哪拿到的
Then why won't you tell me where you got them?

711
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,870
因为有些事情我不想告诉别人
Because there are some things I like to keep to myself.

712
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,220
而且你不是跟我说什么
And didn't you give me a speech

713
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,200
要了解你的另一面吗
about getting to know different sides of you?

714
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,830
这就是我的另一面
Well, this is a different side of me.

715
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,100
要不要相信由你
Are you gonna trust it or not?

716
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,210
先生们
Gentlemen,

717
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,610
很高兴你们能出席如此仓促的会面
I'm so glad you could see us on such short notice.

718
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,230
你给我们一个面子
Well, you scratched our backs.

719
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,900
我觉得我们也可以还你一个面子
I think we can scratch yours.

720
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,830
你们打算提出什么样的和解方案
What kind of settlement are you looking for?

721
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,210
我们不打算和解
We're not looking for a settlement.

722
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,340
我们希望你能供出你的总裁
We're looking for you to give up your CEO.

723
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,530
-什么  -他不会供出任何人的
- What? - He's not giving anyone up.

724
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,480
你们已经放弃了
You've waived your rights

725
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,040
对这个案子提出刑事指控的权利
to criminal charges in this matter.

726
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,380
对  我们说的不是这个案子
Yeah, we're not talking about this matter.

727
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,710
我们说的是共谋隐瞒证据
We're talking about conspiracy to hide evidence.

728
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,050
这是你的分析师发送的两百封电子邮件
That's 200 e-mails from your analyst

729
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,660
嘲笑你们一起洗劫的那些傻瓜们
laughing about the suckers that you all ripped off.

730
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,060
见鬼
Shit.

731
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,270
别着急  他们肯定不是用合法手段弄到的
Relax. There's no way he got those legally.

732
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,070
-你说得对  这不是合法弄到的  -什么
- You're right, we didn't. - What?

733
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,710
该死  你跟我说...
God damn it, you told me--

734
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,060
我知道我是怎么跟你说的  杰克
I know what I told you, Jack,

735
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,050
但如果我告诉你真相
but you wouldn't have let me come here

736
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,380
你就不会让我来开这个会了
if I told you the truth.

737
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,580
而真相...
And the truth...

738
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,570
是我们还通过非法手段拿到了这封邮件
is that we also got this one illegally.

739
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,270
你的总裁在上面说如果事态变得严重
That's your CEO saying that if push comes to shove,

740
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,930
他就会把你推出来当替罪羊
he's gonna throw you under the bus.

741
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,160
你真的愿意冒险
And you really want to take a chance

742
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,210
赌我们没法合法拿到其它那些电子邮件吗
that we won't figure out a way to find these others legally?

743
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,890
你们公司差不多有两百个人吧
You've got 200 people in your firm?

744
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,650
我们会给每个人提供豁免权以换取他们承认
We're gonna offer every single one of them immunity

745
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,930
这些邮件的存在
to admit they exist.

746
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,370
等他们承认时  你和你的总裁中总有一个人
And when they do, either your CEO is going down,

747
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,190
会为此负责
or you are.

748
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,800
很高兴你们终于清醒过来同意叫我们来和解
Glad you came to your senses and called us to settle.

749
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,890
显然杰克森先生
Well, clearly, Mr. Jackson

750
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,600
已经经受了很多生理上的痛苦
has suffered great physical harm.

751
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,700
我只是希望不会再有人受到伤害
I just don't want anyone else to be hurt.

752
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,790
是啊  那就太可惜了
Yeah, that'd be a shame.

753
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,780
那样你还能告谁去
Then who would you have to sue?

754
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,340
-你说什么  -坐下
- Excuse me? - Sit down.

755
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,760
我们开这个会是因为我妹妹
Now, we're here because my sister

756
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,580
想给你五万来了结这件事
wanted to give you $50,000 to make this thing go away,

757
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,570
但我没有听她的
but I didn't listen to her.

758
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,450
所以现在我自掏腰包再加五万
So I'm gonna throw in an extra $50,000 of my own.

759
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,420
无所谓了
It doesn't matter.

760
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,370
因为如果你们以为我们会同意拿十万和解
Because if you think we're gonna settle for $100,000,

761
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,360
那你们这是在浪费我们的时间
you're wasting our time.

762
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,990
十万不是用来和解的
The $100,000 isn't to settle this.

763
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,900
是为了让你的委托人承认
It's to have your client admit that you approached him

764
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,490
他在公共场所发病后你联系了他
after he had a public episode

765
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,910
教唆他宣称自己是在吃了我们的松饼后
and then instructed him to say that it was within five minutes

766
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,390
五分钟内发病的
of eating one of our muffins.

767
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,000
-你没有证据证明这一点  -我们确实没有
- You have no proof of that. - No, we don't.

768
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,650
但他对一个联邦机构所做的虚假陈述
But he's on record for making a false statement

769
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,670
会被记录下来
to a federal agency,

770
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,050
这就意味着等我们真找到证据
which means when we do have proof,

771
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,550
你就要坐很久很久的牢了
you're gonna be in prison for a very, very long time.

772
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,110
十万吗
$100,000?

773
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,320
肯尼斯  等我们打赢官司
Kenneth,You'll get 20 times

774
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,260
你能拿到的钱会是这个的二十倍
that when we win.

775
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,010
或许这能帮你做决定  肯尼斯
Maybe this'll help you decide, Kenneth.

776
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,760
那是什么
What's that?

777
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
你使用过这种手段的客户名单
It's a list of all the other people you've done this with.

778
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,040
-什么  -你以为你是她的第一个客户吗
- What? - Oh, did you think you were her first?

779
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,020
你不是
You were not.

780
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,640
排在第一个的能拿到钱
Whoever rolls over first gets the money,

781
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,730
剩下来的只能排队领橙色狱服了
then the rest get to line up for orange jump suits.

782
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,020
够了  我们要走了
That's enough. We're leaving.

783
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,330
我要怎么做
What do I have to do?

784
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,900
埃斯特  你来做什么
Esther, what are you doing here?

785
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,160
我来给你这个
I came to give you this.

786
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,490
这是张十万的支票
This is a $100,000 check.

787
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,850
是给肯尼斯・杰克森的
It's for Kenneth Jackson.

788
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,690
-我们平摊吧  -不要
- We're splitting this. - No, we're not.

789
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,950
你说得对
You were right.

790
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,200
我一开始就不该试图跟他和解
I never should have tried to settle with him in the first place.

791
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,050
你帮我省了不止十万
You saved me more than that.

792
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,770
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

793
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,400
说你会原谅我
Say you'll forgive me.

794
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,480
我不觉得你是个傻瓜  路易
I don't think you're a buffoon, Louis,

795
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,490
从来没有
and I never have.

796
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,160
但在亲眼见到之前  我并没意识到
But I didn't realize how good a lawyer you were

797
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,180
你是个如此出色的律师
until I saw it myself.

798
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,830
谢谢你的肯定
I appreciate that.

799
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,030
但我知道你为了生意
But I know how hard you worked

800
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,080
有多么努力
to make your business happen,

801
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,510
我也知道你为此放弃了什么
and I know what you gave up,

802
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,890
所以我绝不会让任何人
and there wasn't a snowball's chance in hell

803
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,940
有丝毫的机会占你便宜
that I was gonna let someone take advantage of you.

804
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,090
谢谢你  路易
Thanks, Louis.

805
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,870
我谢你才对
Thank you.

806
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,270
今晚和我一起吃晚餐吗
Do you wanna get dinner tonight?

807
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,060
今晚不行  明晚如何
I can't tonight. How about tomorrow night?

808
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,520
明晚正好
Tomorrow night is perfect.

809
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,430
我们也邀请唐娜一起如何
What do you say we also invite Donna?

810
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,730
那太棒了
That'd be really nice.

811
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,270
你是过来告诉我今天我表现很棒吗
Come by just to tell me how impressive I was today?

812
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,410
我是过来问你为什么还不信任我
I came by to ask you why you still don't trust me.

813
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,710
谁说我不信任你
Who says I don't trust you?

814
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,470
你没告诉我那份证据是非法得来的
You didn't tell me that evidence was obtained illegally.

815
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,260
杰克  我跟你说的是真话
Jack...I told you the truth.

816
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,690
那些邮件不是非法得来的  因为...
Those emails weren't obtained illegally because...

817
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,900
它们根本不是真的
they weren't even real.

818
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,250
什么
What?

819
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,010
我知道交易员们怎么交流
I know how traders talk.

820
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,930
我很清楚他们会说什么话  所以...
I know exactly what they'd say, so...

821
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,260
那是我自己写的
I just wrote them myself.

822
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,020
你在开玩笑吗
Are you shitting me?

823
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,820
看看吧
Take a look.

824
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,800
我之所以骗你
I lied to you

825
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,780
是因为如果要让他们相信证据是非法的
because to get them to believe they were illegal

826
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,660
就得先让他们相信它是真的
I had to get them to believe they were real.

827
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,670
你需要我发火  帮你增强说服力
And you needed me to be pissed to help you do that.

828
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,950
告诉过你要信任我了
Told you to trust me.

829
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,200
你知道吗
You know what?

830
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,740
我信任你
I do.

831
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,870
跟你说实话
So to tell you the truth,

832
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,520
一开始
when we started this thing,

833
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,210
我只是为了拍你的马屁
I was just doing it to kiss your ass

834
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,750
好让杰西卡原谅我
so Jessica would forgive me.

835
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,710
但是
But...

836
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,410
你是个真正的人才
you're the real deal.

837
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,610
我看到了哈维在你身上看到的品质
I see what Harvey sees in you.

838
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,050
谢谢你  杰克
Thanks, Jack.

839
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,930
或许现在你也可以再给哈维一次机会
Maybe now you can give Harvey a second chance too.

840
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,900
他得到的一切都来得太容易了
It's just everything comes so easy to him.

841
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,290
杰西卡把他从邮件室挑了出来
Jessica plucks him from the mailroom.

842
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,700
史上最年轻的高级合伙人
Youngest senior partner ever.

843
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,660
我努力工作了二十年
I been busting my ass for 20 years.

844
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,610
从来没人为我这样做过
Nobody ever does anything like that for me.

845
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,930
告诉你件事  杰克
Well, I'll tell you something, Jack.

846
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,060
他跟其他所有人一样有自己的烦恼
He's got his own problems just like everyone else.

847
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,480
如果你想跟我友好相处
And if you want to get along with me,

848
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,720
最好也能找到跟他和平共处的方式
you better figure out a way to get along with him.

849
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,680
格蕾琴  卡布里洛索赔案进展到哪了
Gretchen, where were we at with the Cabrillo Claim?

850
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,430
-我得走了  -我不是格蕾琴
- I have to go. - I'm not Gretchen.

851
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,520
这对你来说可不妙
And that's too bad for you,

852
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,550
因为她仍旧习惯帮你遮掩
because she's still in the habit of covering for you.

853
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,940
帮我遮掩什么
Covering for me for what?

854
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,830
我告诉过你路易会发现埃斯特的事
I told you Louis was gonna find out about Esther.

855
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,470
我也告诉过你这跟你没关系
And I told you it's none of your business.

856
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,480
在昨天路易问到我
Well, it became my business

857
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,470
而我为了让他别管这件事
when Louis asked me about it yesterday,

858
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,660
只能当面对他撒谎的时候
and I had to lie to his face

859
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,850
这事就跟我有关系了
just to get him to leave it alone.

860
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,170
我可没要求你那么做
I didn't ask you to do that.

861
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,810
你要求了  你自己心里清楚
Yes, you did, and you know it.

862
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,060
唐娜  我没时间讨论这事
Donna, I don't have time for this.

863
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,920
-我有个约会  -什么约会
- I have an appointment-- - What appointment?

864
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,980
我已经问过格蕾琴了
I checked with Gretchen

865
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,120
所以你别想编个约会借机逃跑
so you couldn't get out of this with some made-up thing.

866
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,780
-你的日程表是空的  -你知道吗  唐娜
- Your calendar's empty. - You know what, Donna?

867
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,210
我历尽艰辛学到的一件事
One thing I learned the hard way

868
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,530
就是不要什么都告诉你的秘书
is not to tell your secretary everything.

869
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,770
小心点  哈维
Be careful, Harvey.

870
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,540
因为你要吃点苦头才能了解
Because you're about to learn the hard way

871
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,530
也许这次我向路易说了谎
that I may have lied to Louis about this once,

872
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,290
但我再也不会这么做了
but I am never, never gonna do it again.

873
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,880
哈维
Harvey?

874
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,350
哈维  这四十分钟你神游去哪了
Harvey, where have you been for the last 40 minutes?

875
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,180
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

876
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,700
你安排了这次咨询
I mean, you scheduled a session

877
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,240
来跟我谈谈你母亲
so that we could explore your mother,

878
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,910
但你一直在跟我说
and you've been telling me some meaningless story

879
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,580
被蜜蜂蜇的无聊故事
about when you got stung by a bee.

880
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,840
我跟唐娜吵架了
I got in a fight with Donna.

881
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,910
为什么吵架
Fight about what?

882
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,890
她想让我告诉路易我跟他妹妹上床了
She wants me to tell Louis that I slept with his sister.

883
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,450
她希望你这么做的目的何在
Why, exactly, does she want you to do that?

884
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,570
因为我向路易保证过不会那么做
Because I promised Louis that I wouldn't,

885
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,570
她觉得他迟早会发现
and she thinks he's gonna find out.

886
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,390
如果你无意遵守承诺
Why would you make a promise like that to Louis

887
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,890
为什么还向路易保证呢
if you had no intention of keeping it?

888
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,700
我原本一心一意想遵守承诺
I had every intention of keeping it.

889
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,080
那毕竟是路易的妹妹
It's Louis's sister.

890
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,000
但后来我见到她  然后...
But then I met her, and...

891
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,670
该发生的就发生了
It happened.

892
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,300
那你为什么不就这么告诉他
Well, why don't you just tell him that?

893
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,630
因为他就像个四岁小孩
Because he's like a four-year-old,

894
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,150
再说了  她又不属于他
and on top of that, he doesn't own her.

895
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,240
她是他的妹妹
She's his sister.

896
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,170
但这与他和她妹妹的关系无关
But this isn't about his relationship with his sister.

897
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,170
这是他和你的关系
It's about his relationship with you.

898
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,490
你对他承诺了
You made him a promise.

899
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,410
对  只要他没发现我打破承诺
Yeah, and as long as he doesn't find out I broke it,

900
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,120
那就没关系
it doesn't matter.

901
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,840
鉴于你那天告诉我的事
And in light of the story you told me the other day,

902
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,050
这可能也是某个你熟悉的人对她自己说的
that's probably what someone you know very well said to herself.

903
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,800
你放什么狗屁  拿我和她比
Are you shitting me? You're comparing me to her?

904
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,830
没错
I most certainly am.

905
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,280
就好像你把唐娜置于
Right down to you putting Donna in a position

906
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,280
必须隐瞒的处境
not to say anything.

907
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,680
唐娜不是八岁小孩
Donna is not an eight-year-old boy,

908
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,910
我也没有对我老婆劈腿
and I'm not cheating on my wife.

909
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,900
没错  但你让两个你关心的人
No, but you're putting two people you care about

910
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,400
感到被背叛了
in positions to feel betrayed.

911
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,480
-背叛  -没错
- Betrayed? - Yes.

912
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,590
就像某人和另外一个人有了外遇
Like when someone has an affair with someone else.

913
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,080
够了  你没资格这么对我说话
Okay--you don't get to say that to me.

914
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,710
我的工作就是这么对你说话
It's my job to say things like that to you.

915
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,910
那你就是胡说八道
Then you don't know what you're talking about,

916
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,870
因为我整个人生就是不去
because I've lived my whole life

917
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,130
-重蹈她的覆辙  -当一个人那么做
- not to be her. - And when people do that,

918
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,830
常常会以另一种方式成为了那样的人
they very often become that very thing in a different way.

919
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,330
我才不是她呢
Well, I'm not goddamn her!

920
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,940
好吧  那你最好照照镜子
Well, then, you better take a look in the mirror.

921
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,100
因为你许下承诺又偷偷背着别人
Because you made a promise, snuck behind someone's back

922
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,890
打破承诺  当要面对事实时
to break it, and when confronted with that fact,

923
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,580
你就推脱掉所有责任
you're denying all responsibility.

924
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,410
在我看来  这就像是外遇
That sounds like an affair to me.

925
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,400
你找我吗
You wanted to see me?

926
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,500
你知道我多努力才走到今天这一步
Do you know how hard I worked to get a view like this?

927
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,540
瓦萨学院全额奖学金
Full scholarship to Vassar.

928
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,670
三年哈佛法学院
Three years Harvard law,

929
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,290
作为第三巡回法庭的首位黑人女性
and one year as the first black woman

930
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,070
做了一年的书记员
to clerk in the third circuit.

931
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,600
我不会轻易让别人夺走
And I'm not going to waste all that hard work

932
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,990
我辛辛苦苦争取到的一切
just to let someone take everything away.

933
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,460
杰西卡  在我看来
Jessica, as far as I can tell,

934
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,780
杰克・索罗夫遵守了他的承诺
Jack Soloff is holding up his end of the bargain.

935
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,170
不只这样  他还发了一封邮件
He's doing more than that. He just sent out an email

936
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,100
提名你作为初级合伙人
nominating you for junior partner.

937
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,590
你得想办法拒绝
And you're gonna figure out a way to turn it down.

938
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,520
-什么  -没事  消化一下
- What? - Go ahead, take a minute.

939
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,730
恭喜你  你应得的
Congratulations. You've earned it.

940
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,320
你是我见过最优秀的助理律师
You are the best associate I have ever seen.

941
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,150
现在你有如下选择
Now, these are your options.

942
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,760
医疗事故  家庭问题
Medical issues. Family emergency.

943
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,240
你还没有准备好
You're just not ready.

944
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,320
无论如何  这一次你就是不能接受
Whatever it is, you simply cannot accept

945
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,850
初级合伙人这个职位
a junior partnership at this time.

946
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,660
杰西卡  没有人会拒绝当合伙人
Jessica, no one turns down partner.

947
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,650
现在有了
Well, they do now.

948
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,250
因为我不会发一篇通讯稿
Because I'm not sending out a press release

949
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,090
宣布哈佛毕业的迈克・罗斯升职了
announcing Mike Ross of Harvard just got promoted.

950
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,090
-那就不要发稿  -你没听我说的话
- Then don't send one out. - You're not hearing me.

951
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,440
不  是你没在听我说话
No, you're not hearing me.

952
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,690
如果有消息传出去
What do you think is gonna happen

953
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,860
我得到了每个助理律师梦寐以求的职位
when word gets out that I was offered the one thing

954
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,870
却拒绝了  你觉得之后会发生什么事
that every associate dreams of, and I turned it down?

955
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,320
没什么事会发生
Nothing's going to happen.

956
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,560
因为你要绞尽脑汁
Because you're going to put your mind

957
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,290
像当初你无比热忱地糊弄到这个职位那样
to finding a good reason with as much enthusiasm as you did

958
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,800
去找一个好理由
bullshitting your way into this job

959
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,840
来回绝这个提议
in the first place.

960
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,980
-这是什么  -你明知故问
- What is this? - You know what it is.

961
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,370
我希望你替我给
Portfolio of business I want you to take

962
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,570
皮尔逊-斯佩克特的案子
to Pearson Specter for me.

963
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,560
我不会那么做的
I'm not doing it.

964
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,850
这是你的机会  杰克
This is an opportunity for you, Jack.

965
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,170
不  丹尼尔  这对你来说是机会
No, Daniel, it's an opportunity for you,

966
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,460
我没兴趣再替你趟浑水了
and I'm not interested in carrying your water.

967
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,780
是我记错了  还是我们没讨论过这事
Am I mistaken, or did we not have this discussion?

968
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,410
我们以前讨论过...一次
We discussed it...Once.

969
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,220
我记得
I remember.

970
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,100
那次是你跑来找我
It was during that same conversation we had

971
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,550
讨教如何在背后
when you came to me for advice on the best way

972
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,600
捅哈维刀子
to stab Harvey in the back.

973
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,940
受教了  你帮了我一个忙
I get it. You did me a favor.

974
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,150
但我罢手了
But I'm finished.

975
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,150
我不需要你的建议或者捷径了
I don't want your advice or your shortcuts anymore,

976
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,390
因为那差点害我被解雇
because all it did was almost get me fired.

977
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,770
所以请你...拿着这个
So please... Just take this.

978
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,180
你总是这么兢兢业业  杰克
Ah, you've always been a grinder, Jack.

979
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,720
这话是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

980
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,800
我很欣赏
I admire it.

981
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,190
但你不只是那种书呆子律师
But you're not just a grinder.

982
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,910
你是一个不安分的人
You have a chip on your shoulder.

983
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,850
有件事我清楚
And the thing I've noticed

984
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,920
像你这样不安分的人
about people with chips on their shoulder

985
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,270
总有一天
is that somewhere along the way

986
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,920
会想方设法找别人的茬
they went to great lengths to get 'em off.

987
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,860
我已经找过茬了
I got the chip off my shoulder.

988
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,140
我得到了杰西卡的尊重
I got Jessica's respect.

989
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,850
她并不尊重你
She doesn't respect you.

990
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,180
而且我指的也不是那件事
And that's not the chip I'm talking about.

991
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,770
别再打给我了
Don't call me again.

992
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,080
埃斯特  你在这里做什么
Esther, what are you doing here?

993
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,810
我其实是来和路易唐娜吃晚餐的
I'm actually going out to dinner with Louis and Donna.

994
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,110
感谢邀请
Well, thanks for the invitation,

995
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,320
但我现在最不想做的就是这件事
but that's the last thing in the world I want to do right now.

996
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,920
我来这里不是为了这个
That's not why I'm here.

997
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,250
我在考虑你说的
I was thinking about what you said

998
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,540
我为什么先给你打电话
about why I called you first

999
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,150
而你是怎么看的
and then about how you handled it.

1000
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,780
我想...
And I thought...

1001
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,130
也许你这周可以约我出去
maybe you might want to take me out this weekend.

1002
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,340
埃斯特  你觉得我们是什么关系呢
Esther, what do you think's going on between us?

1003
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,990
-我不知道  我只是...  -你不知道吗
- I don't know, I just-- - You don't know?

1004
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,370
那我告诉你  我们曾共度良宵
Well, I'll tell you. We had a moment.

1005
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,550
很美好  但我无意再偷偷摸摸下去了
It was nice, but I'm not interested in sneaking around.

1006
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,010
谁说什么偷偷摸摸了吗
Who said anything about sneaking around?

1007
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,990
我说的  你才刚离婚
I did. And you just got divorced.

1008
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,740
你是两个孩子的母亲
And you're a mother of two,

1009
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,710
我不想导致...
and I'm not gonna be the reason that--

1010
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,020
-导致什么  -没什么
- That what? - That nothing.

1011
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,550
你为什么不出去吃晚饭
Why don't you just go out to your dinner?

1012
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,000
哈维  告诉我这是什么情况
Harvey, tell me what's going on.

1013
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,430
情况就是  你请我去吃饭被我拒绝了
What's going on is, you asked me out and I said no,

1014
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,340
所以请你别再吵我了
so please just leave me alone.

1015
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,620
哈维
Harvey--

1016
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,150
我说别吵我了
I said leave me alone.

1017
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,380
你在莎拉贝思餐厅订座了吗
Did you make the reservation at Sarabeth's?

1018
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,030
你都问第七次了  订了
For the seventh time, yes.

1019
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,970
这餐厅为什么重要到非得去那里
And why was it so important that it be there anyway?

1020
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,850
因为他们做的松饼比埃斯特的好吃十倍
Because their muffins are ten times better than Esther's,

1021
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:36,770
我想让她知道
and I just want her to know it.

1022
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,260
我以为你俩关系改善了
I thought you two made progress.

1023
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,250
她依然是我姐姐啊
She's still my sister.

1024
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,980
我不能让她以为她在一些事情上是最厉害的
And I can't let her think that she's the best at something.

1025
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,420
好吧
Okay.

1026
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,880
等等  出什么事了吗  你很沮丧的样子
Wait--what's wrong? You look upset.

1027
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,830
没什么事  我只是不太舒服
Nothing's wrong. I'm just not feeling very well.

1028
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,820
看来今晚似乎不太合适
It looks like tonight's not a good night after all.

1029
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,190
不不不  你很沮丧
No, no, no, you're upset.

1030
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,500
不是那样的  路易
It's not that, louis.

1031
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,950
我就是不太舒服
I just don't feel well.

1032
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,820
拜托  改天再约吧
Please, let's just reschedule.

1033
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,780
我给餐厅打电话  然后
I'm gonna just call the restaurant and--

1034
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,390
等一下  等一下
Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.

1035
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,360
她跑这么老远  就为了取消约会吗
She came all the way down here just to cancel?

1036
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,180
我不知道  路易  可能是她
I don't know, Louis, I mean, maybe she was

1037
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,440
已经往这里来了  然后...
already on her way over here and--

1038
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,810
她是从哈维的办公室过来的吗
Did she just come from Harvey's office?

1039
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,170
因为她是从那里过来的
Because that's the direction she came from,

1040
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,390
不是从电梯那里
Not the elevators.

1041
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,650
我不知道  路易  你想让我说什么
I don't know, Louis. What do you want me to say?

1042
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,930
"我不知道"
"I don't know"

1043
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,280
我之前问你
is exactly what you said

1044
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,460
哈维和埃斯特之间
when I asked you if you thought

1045
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,130
有没有发生什么时  你就是这么回答的
there was anything going on between Harvey and Esther,

1046
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,530
现在你又这么说
and now you're saying it again.

1047
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,290
但你是唐娜  你什么都知道
But you're Donna, and you know everything.

1048
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,880
抱歉  路易  我确实知道
I'm sorry, Louis. I do know.

1049
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,410
-你要干什么  -跟你没关系
- What are you gonna do? - None of your business.

1050
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,990
别管了  你已经做得够多的了
Stay out of it. You've done enough.

1051
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,570
你和我现在得谈谈
You and I are gonna have a talk right now.

1052
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,270
无论是什么  都等一下
Hey, whatever it is... it can wait.

1053
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,790
我得告诉你一件事
I need to tell you something.

1054
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,960
跟我姐姐很沮丧地离开这里
Does it have something to do with why my sister

1055
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,010
都不去吃晚饭有关吗
just left here too upset to go out to dinner?

1056
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,240
你个混蛋  我就知道
You piece of shit. I knew it.

1057
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,250
你对她做了什么
What'd you do to her now?

1058
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,260
我没对她做什么  路易
I didn't do anything to her, Louis.

1059
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,570
我说现在
And when I say now,

1060
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,350
指的是相对于你跟她睡过的以前
I mean as opposed to before when you slept with her.

1061
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,870
没错  是唐娜  就是前几天晚上你从我这里偷走
That's right--Donna, the one you tried to steal from me

1062
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,950
拉去吃晚饭的人告诉我
at dinner the other night told me--

1063
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,440
冷静点  我没想偷任何...
Calm down, I didn't try to steal any--

1064
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,990
你向我保证过的
You made a promise to me!

1065
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,180
即便我告诉过你
And even after I told you

1066
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,490
埃斯特和我小时候
about when Esther and I were kids

1067
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,990
男孩子们都利用我接近她
and the boys used me to get to her,

1068
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,760
你依然义无反顾地背叛我
you still went ahead and betrayed me.

1069
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,270
路易  已经发生了
Louis, it had already happened,

1070
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,260
我正要告诉你
and I was just now about to tell you.

1071
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,460
瞎说  你根本没打算要告诉我
Bullshit! You were never gonna tell me.

1072
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,340
你打算把这个秘密
You were gonna keep it to yourself

1073
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,280
-带进棺材里  -路易  你必须相信我
- till the day you died. - Louis, you have to believe me.

1074
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,300
我发誓我正要去告诉你
I swear I was just about to tell you.

1075
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,190
你要做的是准备好被暴揍一顿
What you're about to do is get your ass kicked.

1076
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,550
好吧  你小心点
All right, watch yourself.

1077
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,320
别威胁你对付不了的人
Don't threaten something you can't handle.

1078
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,610
你觉得我对付不了你吗
You don't think I can handle you?

1079
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,520
你还以为我会蠢到发现不了呢
You also thought I was too stupid to find out,

1080
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,780
但我发现了
but I did find out.

1081
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,760
我发现你不过是个撒谎...
I found out that you're nothing but a lying, cheating--

1082
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,340
我没有欺骗埃斯特
I did not cheat with Esther.

1083
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,600
那是两个成年人
It was two grown people

1084
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,450
自己做出的一个决定
making a goddamn decision for themselves.

1085
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,470
那个决定却以
Well, that decision ended

1086
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,270
她哭着走出这里结束
with her walking out of here near tears

1087
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,180
因为她不清楚全部真相
because she didn't have all the facts,

1088
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,870
比如你是个玩弄女人的惯犯
like the fact that you're a serial womanizer

1089
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,020
别的女人一撩拨
who can't stand when anyone else

1090
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,930
-就不能自持  -快闭嘴
- has anything. - Shut the hell up!

1091
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,750
所以能到手的女人他都要
So he takes whatever woman's in sight...

1092
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,240
-我告诉你  -因为他在可怜的童年时期
- I'm telling you. - Because he's so messed up

1093
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,050
遭受了什么破事  导致他现在
from whatever goddamn thing happened to him

1094
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,990
-这么人渣...  -闭嘴
- in his pathetic childhood... - Shut the hell up!

1095
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,050
他不能
He can't--

1096
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,210
哈维
Harvey.

1097
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,550
滚开
Get away from me.

1098
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,330
你滚出去
You get the hell out of here.
