《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on Suits

8
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,130
-杰夫  -杰西卡  你说的对
- Jeff... - Jessica, you were right.

9
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,080
要么两者兼得  要么两者皆失
We either need to have both, or it's not going to work.

10
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,140
此刻起  我提出辞职
Effective immediately, I'm tendering my resignation.

11
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,950
傅滋曼可不会做没有回报
Forstman doesn't throw money around

12
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,510
白白撒钱的亏本生意
without getting something in return.

13
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,140
他会赚到钱
He's gonna get money in return.

14
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,580
他的心中钱只排在第三位
Money is third on his list.

15
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,460
前两位是报复人
The first two are getting back at people

16
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,860
和控制人
and getting control of people.

17
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,430
你这个混蛋
Son of a bitch.

18
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,140
你让我来不是为了让你签字
You didn't bring me here for you to sign on the arrows.

19
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,120
而是为了让我签字
You brought me here for me to sign on the arrows.

20
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,060
没错
Yep.

21
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,590
伍德尔失去工作后
After Woodall lost his job,

22
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,600
傅滋曼把他安排到了证监会
Forstman got him installed at the S.E.C.,

23
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,410
证据在哪里
Where's the proof?

24
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,890
在埃里克·伍德尔的银行账户里
In Eric Woodall's bank accounts.

25
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,110
太可笑了
This is ridiculous.

26
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,510
我是你上司
I'm your boss.

27
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,030
先生们  给我一分钟
Gentlemen, give me a minute.

28
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,610
你就是逼我
You're forcing me to turn you in 

29
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,320
检举你12年前做的事情
for what you did 12 years ago.

30
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,580
你不会的
You're not gonna do that,

31
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,100
因为你也牵涉其中了  伙计
because you did it too, pal.

32
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,230
其他人对我失去信心
Anyone else every loses faith in me,

33
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
我根本不在乎
it doesn't matter.

34
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,480
但你不行
But with you, it's different.

35
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,080
我该走了
I should go.

36
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,550
为什么
Why?

37
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,820
你知道我爱你  唐娜
You know I love you, Donna.

38
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,980
敬哈维
To Harvey.

39
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,970
敬哈维  干杯
To Harvey. Cheers.

40
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,360
杰伊  给我杯麦卡伦18年
Jay, can I get a Macallan 18?

41
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,870
要知道  一般来说第一次胜诉
You know, usually when someone wins their first trial,

42
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,740
至少会假装把助理地检官
they at least pretend to finish the drink

43
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,310
同事们买的酒喝完
their fellow ADAs bought them.

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,540
抱歉  我们...
I'm sorry, do we--

45
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,800
认识吗  还不呢
Know each other? Not yet.

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,280
但今天你走运
But today's your lucky day.

47
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,480
为什么
And why is that?

48
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,360
因为你今天能结识唐娜
Because it's the day you get to meet Donna.

49
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,330
我猜猜  你是唐娜吗
And let me guess. You're Donna.

50
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,730
你可不知道我有多唐娜呢
Oh, you have no idea how Donna I am.

51
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,330
-好吧  唐娜  我是哈维...  -斯佩克特
- Well, Donna, I'm Harvey-- - Harvey Specter.

52
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,480
你觉得我要是不知道你是谁
You really think I'd be talking to you

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,540
还会跟你说话吗
if I didn't know who you were?

54
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,500
你究竟怎么知道我的
And how exactly do you know about me?

55
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,600
我知道所有人
I know about everybody.

56
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,360
我不知道的是
What I don't know is

57
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,450
为什么选这个案子作为你的法庭处子秀
why this is the first case you ever took to trial.

58
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,080
因为是白领犯罪
Because it was a white-collar crime,

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,590
不是街角的毒贩
not some drug dealer on a corner,

60
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,880
所以这种案子
which makes it the kind of case--

61
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,200
能让你上报纸
That puts your name in the paper.

62
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,850
你不仅是长得美  是吧
You're not just a pretty face, are you?

63
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,990
的确
No, I'm not.

64
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,660
所以或许你该请我一杯酒
So maybe you should buy me a drink,

65
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,620
我们可以去角落里继续对话
and we can continue this conversation in the corner.

66
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,720
杰伊
Jay?

67
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,290
肖恩  你大晚上的
Sean, what are you doing in my building

68
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,280
跑来我公寓楼做什么
in the middle of the night?

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,820
你不是不再跟踪我了吗
I thought we were done with you following me.

70
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,860
我没跟踪你
I'm not following you.

71
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,570
我在等你
I'm waiting for you.

72
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,630
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

73
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,450
你  还是证监会
You need my help, or the SEC needs my help?

74
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,130
都是
We both do.

75
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,620
但现在  我更在乎我自己
But at the moment, I care more about me

76
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,850
而不是证监会
than I do about the SEC.

77
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,210
我找不到那笔钱了
I can't find the money.

78
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,450
什么意思
What do you mean you can't find the money?

79
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,070
你这三个月都在做什么
What the hell have you been doing for the last three months?

80
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,860
找钱
Looking for the money.

81
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,910
那就再使劲点找
Then look harder,

82
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,060
伍德尔可不是做慈善的
because Woodall isn't in the charity business.

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,310
傅兹曼贿赂人
Forstman buys people,

84
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,330
我们把那人双手奉上了
and we handed them to you on a silver platter.

85
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,550
我为你冒了险
And I stuck my neck out for you,

86
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,280
指控我朋友受贿
and I accused my friend of being on the take.

87
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,080
如果我不能把事做到底
Now, if I can't follow through with that, 

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,930
埃里克·伍德尔就要逃脱罪责了
Eric Woodall walks.

89
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,160
查尔斯·傅兹曼也是
Charles Forstman walks.

90
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,650
你都找不到钱  为什么认为
Well, what makes you think I can find the money

91
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,460
我能
when you couldn't?

92
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,680
我不知道你能不能
I don't know if you can or not,

93
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,370
但这个案子我只剩五天时间了
but they're gonna shut me down in five days,

94
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,920
我需要一切的帮助
and I need all the help I can get.

95
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,090
不说我了  说说你吧
Okay, enough about me. Let's talk about you.

96
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,220
我最喜欢的话题呢
Ooh, my favorite subject.

97
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,080
你知道我怎么想吗
You know what I think? 

98
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,690
我觉得你最喜欢的话题找到我
I think your favorite subject didn't come up to me

99
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,560
不是为了问我为什么上庭
just to find out why I went to trial.

100
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,730
你有所求
You want something.

101
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,310
是啊
I sure do.

102
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,200
我觉得我或许能给你
And I think I might be ready to give it to you.

103
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,260
不是性
It's not sex.

104
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,740
那当我没说
Then never mind.

105
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,760
你还真是坦诚啊
Wow, you're gonna be that honest about it.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,020
省时间嘛
Saves time.

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,430
那我也不绕弯  我要做你的秘书
Well, in that case, I want to move to your desk.

108
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,100
为什么
And why is that?

109
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,760
因为人人知道  你再过几年
Because it's no secret that in a few years,

110
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,560
就要回高登·施密特·范·戴克律所
you're going back to Gordon, Schmidt, and Van Dyke.

111
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,890
我猜猜  你到时想一起来
And let me guess, you want to come with me when I do.

112
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,140
不
No, I don't.

113
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,590
那为什么
Then why?

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,600
因为我要做个演员
Because I'm gonna be an actress,

115
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,200
我想要一个知道
and I want somebody who understands

116
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,600
人生不止局限于地检官办公室的人
that there's more to life than just the DA's office.

117
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,810
而且我能付出一切
And that I can give my all to them

118
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,980
但偶尔还能去试镜
but still step out for the occasional audition.

119
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,380
你这就要抛弃我啊
So you're stepping out on me already?

120
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,250
是的  但重点是
Yes, but the important thing is,

121
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,110
我提前告诉你了啊
I'm telling you about it in advance.

122
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,510
麦卡伦36年
Macallan 36.

123
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,930
我没点这个啊
I didn't order a Macallan 36.

124
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,250
那边的先生送的
It's from the gentleman over there.

125
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,430
我不知道那人是谁
Okay, I don't know who that is,

126
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,190
但我现在就告诉你  他是麻烦
but I'm telling you right now, he is bad news.

127
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,190
你看上去不一样了
You look different.

128
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,470
我就当是夸我了
I will take that as a compliment.

129
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,610
我是说我没想到会见到你这样子...
I meant I wasn't expecting to see you like that--

130
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,860
我知道你什么意思
I-I know what you meant.

131
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,550
你的意思是  你根本没想到
What you really meant is that you weren't expecting

132
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,850
会看到我
to see me at all.

133
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,490
什么
Excuse me?

134
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,930
拜托  哈维
Come on, Harvey.

135
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,650
自从迈克回到律所
Ever since Mike came back to the firm,

136
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,720
你就一直视我不存在
I've basically been nonexistent to you.

137
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,390
怎么了
What's going on?

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,230
卡荷尔找不到那笔钱
Cahill can't find the money.

139
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,380
什么叫找不到那笔钱
What do you mean he can't find the money?

140
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,620
他这么长时间都在做什么啊
What's he been doing this whole time?

141
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,420
-我也这么说的  -他怎么说的
- Yeah, that's what I said. - And what did he say?

142
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,470
他说他遇到麻烦了  需要我们帮忙
He said he's in trouble and he needs our help.

143
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,260
我要告诉你一些不能告诉他的事
And I'm gonna tell you what I couldn't tell him.

144
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,430
他找不到钱
He can't find the money

145
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,490
是因为他找错了地方
because he's been looking in the wrong place.

146
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,740
那应该去哪里找
So where's the right place?

147
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,020
我也不太清楚
I don't know exactly.

148
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,670
但就在某处存在着一个埃里克·伍德尔在乎的人
But somewhere, there's a person Eric Woodall cares about,

149
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,010
那里就是钱的去处
and that's where the money went.

150
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,800
我们为什么不能跟卡荷尔这么说
And why can't we tell Cahill that?

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,600
因为我不想让他知道我是如何知道这件事的
Because I don't want him to know how I know it.

152
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,090
-那你是怎么知道的  -我就是知道
- How do you know it? - Because I know.

153
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,690
你想要个存在的机会
You want a chance to exist?

154
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,290
那就想出方法解决这件事
Figure out a way to get this done.

155
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,220
{\an8}我需要你  路易

156
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,920
路易  我收到你的便签了
Louis, I got your note,

157
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,840
我也知道诺玛还没回来
and I know that Norma's still out,

158
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,350
但我真的没时间
but I really don't have time to--

159
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,190
诺玛死了
Norma's dead.

160
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,520
什么
What?

161
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,640
她今早照顾她姐姐时去世了
She died this morning taking care of her sister.

162
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,320
路易  我很抱歉
Oh, Louis, I'm so sorry.

163
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,700
不用装了  唐娜
You don't need to fake it, Donna.

164
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,350
我没有在装
I'm not faking it.

165
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,130
她是个不错的人
She was a sweet woman.

166
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,150
她就是个母老虎
She was a frickin' battle-ax is what she was.

167
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,050
过去的每一天
There wasn't a day that went by 

168
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,290
我都想把她曲张的静脉拽出来
that I didn't want to rip out

169
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,270
然后用它来勒死她
one of her varicose veins and strangle her with it.

170
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,560
好吧  我觉得你现在
Okay, I don't think you're in touch with 

171
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,770
无法认清自己的真实想法
how you're really feeling right now.

172
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,380
我现在的感觉就是她像往常一样
How I'm feeling is that she left me high and dry

173
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,660
留我在这里孤立无援
just like she always did.

174
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,410
你还想让她继续工作
You expect her to keep working?

175
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,500
看看这个
Look at this.

176
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,720
这是她全部的财产清单
It's her entire estate laid out on paper.

177
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,830
她没办法管理我的日程
She couldn't manage my calendar,

178
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,050
却对自己的生活确精细到极致
but this crap that she plans within an inch of her life.

179
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,160
你希望我确保这些
And you want me to make sure

180
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,510
资产得到妥善安置
these things are bequeathed properly?

181
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,980
你把它们拿去填充玩具我也不管
You can stuff them in a giant pinata for all I care.

182
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,120
我还得去找个像样的罐子
I have to go find the perfect urn

183
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,790
装着她的骨灰从楼顶扔下去
to throw her ashes off the top of the building.

184
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,690
她这么要求的
She requested that?

185
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,160
没有  她想把骨灰放在这里
No, she wanted them to be in here with me,

186
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,440
但我绝不会那么做的
but like hell I'm gonna do that.

187
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,280
好吧  路易  我帮你处理这件事
Okay, Louis, I will take care of this for you,

188
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,390
但你不能在我不在的时候去撒她的骨灰
but you're not throwing her ashes anywhere without me.

189
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,090
好吧
Okay, fine.

190
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,690
那你需要我去和哈维打个招呼吗
Do you want me to smooth things over with Harvey for you?

191
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,630
不用
No.

192
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,400
哈维现在自己靠自己就很好
Harvey will be just fine on his own.

193
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,940
我知道你是谁  我不感兴趣
I know who you are, and I'm not interested.

194
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,580
就因为我的名声不好吗
Just 'cause I got a bad reputation?

195
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,930
我不想因为把你的对手关起来了
Because I'm not accepting a drink

196
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,640
就和你喝酒
for putting your rival behind bars.

197
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,070
你想错了  伙计
You got the wrong idea, pal.

198
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,360
我请你喝酒不是因为你把我的敌人关起来了
I didn't buy you that for putting my enemy away.

199
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,540
而是因为你把他关进去的方法
I bought you that for how you put my enemy away.

200
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,700
好吧  你得到我的注意了
Okay, you got me.

201
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,470
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

202
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,340
你
You.

203
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,160
你身上有些特别的东西
You've got something special.

204
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,540
我希望这样的人
And I want people with something special

205
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,530
为我工作
working for me.

206
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,460
我为什么会想要为你工作
Why exactly would I want to work for you?

207
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,740
我可以想到一百万个理由
I can think of a million reasons,

208
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,510
那正是我要给你的签约奖金
'cause that's the signing bonus I'm gonna give you,

209
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,050
那个数额也远超过
and that's a hell of a lot more money

210
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,420
你做一辈子律师能挣到的钱
than you're ever gonna make as a lawyer.

211
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,090
那我如果告诉你
And what if I told you

212
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,520
我当律师不是为了钱呢
I don't practice law to make money?

213
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,680
那我就会问你  你当律师是为了什么
Then I'd ask you, what do you practice it for?

214
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,770
为了让人们按我的意愿行事
To bend people to my will.

215
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,040
那就为我让别人按你的意愿行事
Then bend people to your will for me

216
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,250
除此之外再大赚一笔
and make a lot of money on top of it.

217
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,490
但傅滋曼先生  事情是这样的
Well, here's the thing, Mr. Forstman.

218
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,950
虽然这跟你没什么关系
Not that it's any of your business,

219
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,400
但我马上就可以每年挣五十万
but I'll be making 1/2 million a year in no time.

220
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,920
每年挣五十万算个屁
1/2 million a year is dick.

221
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,170
我的园丁都挣那么多
My gardener makes that.

222
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,480
那就去找你的园丁吧
Then go offer your gardener a job,

223
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,660
因为我不感兴趣
because I'm not interested.

224
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,460
顺便说一句
Just so you know, 

225
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,550
如果你改变主意想来找我了
if you change your mind and come back to me,

226
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,470
那时候情况可就不一样了
it's not gonna be the same conversation.

227
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
谢谢你的酒  祝你好运  傅滋曼先生
Thanks for the drink. Good luck, Mr. Forstman.

228
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,560
你在干什么
What are you doing?

229
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,830
你觉得我在干什么
What do you think I'm doing?

230
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,490
如果傅滋曼把钱给了伍德尔亲近的人
If Forstman gave the money to someone Woodall's close to,

231
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,840
我们需要开始画家谱了
we need to start by compiling a family tree.

232
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,580
我是说你今天怎么不去上学
I meant why aren't you at school today?

233
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,330
因为我要向哈维证明我确实存在
Because I'm gonna prove to Harvey that I exist.

234
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,180
好吧
Okay.

235
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,110
既然你提起了  昨晚是怎么回事
Now that you mention it, what was that last night?

236
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,290
自从你回来
Ever since you came back,

237
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,810
就好像你和哈维在说着某种秘密语言
it's like you and Harvey speak this secret language,

238
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,700
而我却参与不进去
and I'm not a part of it.

239
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,150
瑞秋  别这样  我们有感情基础的
Rachel, come on. We have history.

240
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,240
我说的不是感情基础  我说的是尊重
I'm not talking about history. I'm talking about respect.

241
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,870
好吧  如果你认为哈维不尊重你
Okay, you don't know what you're talking about

242
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,420
那你一定是想错了
if you think Harvey doesn't respect you.

243
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,480
你是想跟我说昨晚
Are you gonna tell me that last night

244
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,420
他没有给你个表情暗示
he didn't give you a look that said,

245
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,050
"你不用全告诉她
"You don't need to tell her the full story

246
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,660
因为她没必要知道"
because she doesn't need to know"?

247
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,880
瑞秋  他用眼神示意
Rachel, he didn't give me that look

248
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,070
不是因为他不尊重你
because he doesn't respect you.

249
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,100
而是因为他觉得羞耻
He gave me that look because he's ashamed.

250
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,560
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

251
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,740
这么说吧  被查尔斯·傅滋曼耍过的
Let's just say that I'm not the only one

252
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,130
并不是只有我一个
that Charles Forstman duped.

253
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,520
-哈维也被傅滋曼摆了一道  -是的
- Harvey got taken by Forstman? - Yes.

254
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,370
他只告诉了我  因为他没选择
And he only told me because he had to

255
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,240
那时正时收购战激战正酣的时候
when we were in the middle of that takeover battle.

256
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,170
所以哈维才谁都不在乎
That's why Harvey's so slow to care about anybody.

257
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,150
傅滋曼利用了他在意的人
Forstman used somebody he cared about.

258
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,590
该死  我怎么没想到过
Holy shit. I never even thought about that.

259
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,120
你觉得会是谁
Who do you think it was?

260
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,290
我不知道  但我有个不错的猜想
I don't know, but I have a pretty good guess.

261
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,760
你觉得怎么样
Well, what do you think?

262
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,800
我觉得这地方很逊  而且我很忙
I think this place is a dump, and I'm busy,

263
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,540
所以为什么不直说  叫我来干什么
so why don't you tell me why we're here?

264
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,580
我想在这开餐厅
I want to open a restaurant here.

265
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,680
马库斯  这里已经是一家餐厅了
Marcus, there's already a restaurant here.

266
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,010
而且买卖不好
And it isn't working.

267
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,870
所以他们租不下去了
Which is why they're gonna lose their lease.

268
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,530
看看这个
Take a look.

269
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,390
我已经找到了厨师
I've got a chef.

270
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,800
取得了酒类许可证
I've got a liquor license.

271
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,150
还有改造计划
I've got renovation plans.

272
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,400
我万事俱备
I have everything I need.

273
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,180
只差资金
Except the money.

274
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,360
我需要十五万美元
I need $150,000.

275
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,400
-你疯了  -拜托  哈维
- Are you crazy? - Come on, Harvey.

276
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,450
这是我的梦想
This is my dream.

277
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,030
我知道我能干好
I know I can make this work.

278
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,070
我不是说你不能
And I'm not saying you can't,

279
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,290
但我没有这笔钱
but I don't have that kind of money.

280
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,320
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

281
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,020
你是大牌律师
You're the big-time lawyer 

282
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,460
而且刚刚上了报纸
who just got his name in the paper.

283
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,210
上了报纸  也没人多给我钱
My name in the paper doesn't pay me extra money.

284
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,290
我每年收入是五万美元
I make $50,000 a year.

285
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,230
你说过你要当企业律师了
And you said you were gonna be a corporate lawyer.

286
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,420
是的  我当了之后可以帮助你  但现在...
Yeah, and when I am, I can help you, but right now...

287
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,920
我才不管你现在怎样
I don't give a shit about right now.

288
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,430
我只在乎你什么时候才能
I give a shit about when you were supposed to be

289
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,060
有个大哥的样子  可你呢  做了什么
my big brother, but instead, what did you do?

290
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,030
我知道我做了什么
I know what I did.

291
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,820
那你知道  我这辈子
Then you know I can never get a loan

292
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,080
都贷不到款吧
for as long as I live.

293
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,710
马库斯  你什么时候才能对自己
Marcus, when are you gonna take responsibility

294
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,460
负起责任呢
for your own shit?

295
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,060
你以为我这是在努力干什么
What the hell does it look like I'm trying to do?

296
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,150
我第一个来找你  是因为我知道你希望我成功
I came to you first because I know you'd want me to,

297
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,990
但如果你不想帮我
but if you don't come through,

298
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,590
我就去找妈妈
I'm gonna go to Mom.

299
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,100
你说的不是妈妈
You don't mean Mom.

300
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,170
你说的是他
You mean him.

301
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,650
你一份钱也不许跟那个男人要
And you're not taking a nickel from that man.

302
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,240
拿他的钱  也不会
Taking his money isn't gonna make

303
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,550
让他对爸爸做出的事变得更糟
what he did to Dad any worse.

304
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,120
这是胡扯  你心知肚明
That's bullshit, and you know it,

305
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,490
我不会让你这么干的
and I'm not gonna let you do it.

306
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,740
哈维
Hey, Harvey.

307
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,830
你要怎么阻止我
How the hell are you gonna stop me?

308
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,680
我疯了吗
Am I crazy,

309
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,360
还是你确实穿了
or is that the same dress you were wearing

310
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,590
上次见面时的那条裙子
the last time I saw you?

311
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,840
肯定是你疯了
You must be crazy,

312
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,770
因为我从不穿同一件衣服
because I don't wear the same dress ever.

313
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,050
那你的衣橱肯定投入了巨资
Then you must spend a fortune on wardrobe.

314
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,400
但我必须说  这很值得
But I have to say, it's worth it.

315
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,590
我突然觉得  你不是顺路来拜访那么简单
I suddenly get the feeling this isn't just a drop-by.

316
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,710
我想加快速度
I want to move up our timeline.

317
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,110
哈维  我们说好的
Harvey, we have a deal.

318
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,960
我亲自为你而努力
I put myself on the line for you,

319
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,080
而这个约定不能改
and our deal is not going to change.

320
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,120
我可以把钱还你  自己另谋高就
I could just pay you the money back and move on.

321
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,220
如果你能那么做  你就不会到这来
And if you could do that, you wouldn't be here

322
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,500
要求回来
asking to come back.

323
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,210
这次马库斯又输了多少钱
How much money did Marcus lose this time?

324
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,270
他没输钱  他想开一家餐厅
He didn't lose anything. He wants to start a restaurant.

325
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,920
他不能这么做
He doesn't want to start shit.

326
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,600
他肯定还欠别人什么东西
He owes somebody something.

327
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,650
你不了解情况  他已经浪子回头了
You don't know that. He's turned his life around.

328
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,770
在我看来  他有问题
What I know is, he has a problem,

329
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,710
而且他希望从你这里拿钱
and he's looking to get money from you.

330
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,200
而你不会从我这里拿到钱的
And you're not gonna get it from me.

331
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,880
那我就从别的地方弄
Then I'll get it somewhere else.

332
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,590
这话什么意思
And what's that supposed to mean?

333
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,610
查尔斯·傅滋曼要我去为他工作
I got a job offer from Charles Forstman.

334
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,750
看着我
Look at me.

335
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,380
我不管他向你许诺了什么
I don't care what he's offering you.

336
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,660
不要接受
Don't take it.

337
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,060
是因为他名声很差吗
Because he's got a bad reputation?

338
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,960
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know that?

339
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,780
我觉得你自以为知道很多事
I think there are a lot of things

340
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,390
但其实你并不了解
you think you know that you don't.

341
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,160
我只知道  要么你帮助我
What I know is, you're either gonna help me

342
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,650
要么查尔斯·傅滋曼帮我
or Charles Forstman is.

343
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,630
都取决于你
It's up to you.

344
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,240
哈维  我无法强迫你听我的
Harvey, I can't make you listen to me,

345
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,020
但我不会让你到这来
but what I'm not going to do is let you come here

346
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,650
用一个卑鄙的银行家
and leverage me with some bullshit offer

347
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,920
来威胁我给你些什么  所以随你便
from a shady banker, so do what you're gonna do.

348
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,190
别说我没有警告过你
But don't say I didn't warn you.

349
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,860
你要买多少"奇迹面包"都行  埃里克
You can buy all the Wonder Bread you want, Eric,

350
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,320
但你没法带进监狱
but you can't take it with you to prison.

351
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,380
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

352
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,720
我来提醒你一旦他们找到那笔钱
I'm here to remind you that once they find the money,

353
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,450
事情就全败露了
it's all gonna come tumbling down.

354
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,990
他们找不到的
Well, they're not gonna find the money,

355
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,200
因为根本没有那笔钱
'cause there is no money.

356
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,620
不在你的账户  卡荷尔不知道但我知道
Not in your accounts, but I know what Cahill doesn't.

357
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,110
傅滋曼把钱交给你在乎的人
Forstman gave it to somebody you care about,

358
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,920
等我告诉他  那一切就太晚了
and if I tell him that, it'll be too late.

359
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,180
我知道你想干什么
I know what you're trying to do.

360
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,900
你想引我把钱转走
You're trying to bait me into moving the body.

361
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,910
我们都知道你没那么傻
We both know you're not dumb enough to do that.

362
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,640
我是来给跟你做个交易
I'm here to get you to cut a deal

363
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,440
让你供出傅滋曼
and turn Forstman in.

364
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,890
你没资格跟我谈交易
You don't have the authority to cut a deal.

365
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,360
确实  但你雇我当你律师后
No, but I can get Cahill to

366
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,600
我可以让卡荷尔来谈交易
after you hire me to represent you.

367
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,020
你说雇只狐狸来看鸡舍
You mean hire the fox to watch the henhouse?

368
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,350
门都没有
Not a chance.

369
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,720
埃里克  他们就要查到你了
Eric, they're closing in,

370
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,480
一旦查到  你就需要找我了
and when they do, you're gonna want to call me.

371
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,240
不如你先收下我的名片
So why don't you take my card?

372
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,600
太可笑了
This is ridiculous.

373
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,730
伍德尔有30个值得怀疑的人
Woodall's got 30 people it could be,

374
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,860
也可能根本不在这30人里
or it could be none of them.

375
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,470
我知道  但这是我们的任务
I know that, but this is our job.

376
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,650
不  我们的任务是帮哈维打败傅滋曼
No, our job is to help Harvey get Forstman.

377
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,660
如果我们的想法一致
If you're thinking what I think you're thinking--

378
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,550
-一致  -瑞秋  因为12年前的事
- I am, and you are too. - Rachel, we are never gonna get Harvey

379
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,910
我们没办法让哈维去追究傅滋曼
to go after Forstman for what they did 12 years ago.

380
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,610
为什么  因为他弟弟
Why, because of his brother?

381
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,220
对  因为他弟弟或者因为他惭愧
Yes, because of his brother, or because he's ashamed.

382
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,070
不管怎么说  他知道有种可能性
Either way, he knows it's a possibility.

383
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,960
他用不着我去告诉他
He doesn't need me to tell him about it.

384
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,570
不  他只是不要我去告诉他
No, he just doesn't need me to tell him about it.

385
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,510
-瑞秋  -这与那个无关
- Rachel-- - This is not about that.

386
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,880
我不能告诉他
Look, I can't tell him

387
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,100
因为我不该知道这件事  但你可以
because I'm not supposed to know, but you can.

388
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,080
我说了他根本不想听
And I just told you, he doesn't want to hear it.

389
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,410
但他什么时候阻止过你说呢
And when has that ever stopped you before?

390
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,070
-这不一样  -为什么
- This is different. - Why?

391
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,660
因为他为此惭愧
Because he's ashamed.

392
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,050
那他现在的想法就有问题
Then he's not thinking right,

393
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,970
他比任何时候都需要你
and he needs your help more than ever.

394
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,820
那我们一起告诉他
Then we're both telling him.

395
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,850
迈克  我不需要那份功劳
Mike, I don't need the credit.

396
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,160
不  这无关功劳  这与我们有关
No, this isn't about credit. This is about us.

397
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,210
他不能指望我会对你有所隐瞒
He can't tell me something and expect me not to tell you.

398
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,880
你想见我
You wanted to see me?

399
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,650
没错  你这一整天去哪儿了
Yes. Where have you been all day?

400
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,400
怎么了  你有事要跟我说吗
Why? Is there something you want to talk about?

401
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,430
对啊  你去哪里了
Yeah, where you've been.

402
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,300
肖恩·卡荷尔昨晚到我门口
Sean Cahill was at my door last night--

403
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,540
哈维  诺玛去世了
Harvey, Norma passed away.

404
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,950
我在帮路易的忙
I've been helping Louis.

405
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,280
诺玛死了
Norma died?

406
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,460
真糟糕
That's terrible.

407
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,490
我还以为你受不了她呢
I thought you couldn't stand her.

408
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,870
我是受不了  但我以为路易爱她...
I couldn't, but I assume Louis loved her, so...

409
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,990
该干什么干什么去吧
Do what you need to do. 

410
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,780
因为她是他的秘书  所以他肯定爱她
Because she was his secretary, he must have loved her.

411
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,080
-我不是这意思  -但你就是这么说的
- That's not what I meant. - But it is what you said.

412
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,090
好吧  唐娜  怎么了
Okay, Donna. What's wrong?

413
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,600
那我们先来谈谈这个吧
How about we start with the fact

414
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,590
过去的十个小时里我都在想
that I have been wondering for the last ten hours

415
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,080
你会不会承认昨晚发生的事
if you're going to acknowledge what happened last night.

416
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
但你还是这样  所以你肯定不会承认了
But you're you, so of course you're not.

417
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,180
我不会承认什么
I'm not gonna acknowledge it

418
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,500
因为昨晚什么都没发生
because nothing happened last night.

419
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
为什么  别说我知道
Why? And don't tell me I know why.

420
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,280
因为你知道那会是一个错误
Because it would have been a mistake, and you know it.

421
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,850
我知道的是昨晚有事发生了
What I know is something happened,

422
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,750
但在你告诉我你爱我之后就跑掉了
and you ran away, but not before you told me you loved me.

423
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,090
我之所以那么说是为了让你好受点
I did that because I wanted to make you feel better.

424
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,230
你刚才说了什么
What did you just say to me?

425
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,870
我不是这个意思  我不是说...
That's not what I meant. I didn't say that--

426
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,540
因为你可怜我  你说了
Because you pity me? Yeah, you did.

427
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,460
不是  我那么说是因为我爱你
No, I said it because I love you,

428
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,500
我希望你知道
and I wanted you to know it.

429
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,710
怎么爱我了
Love me how?

430
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,420
-为什么非得...  -怎么爱我了
- Why does that have to-- - Love me how?

431
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,380
跟我想的一样
That's what I thought.

432
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,830
你要么无法回答要么不想回答
You either can't answer or you won't,

433
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,740
简直胡扯  因为显然
which is bullshit, because obviously,

434
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,350
你根本不是那么看我的
you don't just look at me this way.

435
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,250
你可以那么看待我
You're capable of looking at me that way,

436
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,780
但你不想让世界崩溃
but you don't want to let those worlds collide

437
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,450
因为你害怕失去一切
because you're afraid to risk anything.

438
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,670
因为我们拥有一切
Because we have everything.

439
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,610
不  哈维  是你拥有一切
No, Harvey. You have everything.

440
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,380
那你想要拥有一切吗
So you're saying you want everything?

441
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,090
我不知道  哈维
I don't know, Harvey,

442
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,730
但我知道  我不需要你的怜悯
but what I do know is I don't want your pity.

443
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,040
你在这里做什么  没人知道我住这里
What are you doing here? Nobody finds out where I live.

444
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,160
我知道
I do.

445
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,540
稍等  我把这个关掉
Hold on a second. Let me turn this off.

446
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
你开玩笑吧  你在看《华尔街》
You got to be kidding me. You're watching Wall Street?

447
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
{\an8}《华尔街》为1987年奥利弗·斯通导演的电影

448
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,740
每月一次提醒自己
A monthly ritual to remind myself.

449
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,780
提醒什么
Of what?

450
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,260
戈登.盖可有多胆小
Of what a pussy Gordon Gekko is.

451
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,260
{\an8}戈登·盖可为电影《华尔街》中臭名昭著的金融家

452
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,810
说说你怎么改变主意了吧
Now, you want to tell me what changed your mind?

453
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,860
我认为我还是需要钱
I decided I wanted the money.

454
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,960
你拒绝过我
And you turned me down,

455
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,060
现在你该告诉我为什么需要钱
so now you're gonna tell me why you want the money.

456
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,510
我弟弟需要十五万开餐馆
My brother needs $150,000 for a restaurant.

457
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,790
现在有的谈了
Now we're getting somewhere.

458
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,610
-说吧  -好吧  你想听吗
- Let's have it. - Okay, you want it?

459
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,260
是这样的
Here it is.

460
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,780
这不只是个餐馆  还是个洗心革面的机会
It's not just a restaurant. It's a second chance.

461
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,300
马库斯赌博成瘾
Marcus has a gambling problem,

462
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,260
我帮他戒掉了
and I gave it to him.

463
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,780
你觉得这是他重新做人的机会
And you think this is his way out?

464
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,040
这确实是
I know it is.

465
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,260
咱俩不怎么对路呀
We're not a good fit,

466
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,210
餐馆经常倒闭
'cause restaurants fail,

467
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,640
一旦他的餐馆倒闭  你就会离开
and when this one does, you'll leave.

468
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,740
所以你还是现在就离开的好
So you might as well leave right now.

469
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,320
不如我们赌一把
Then how about we bet on it?

470
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,400
你要靠赌博
You're gonna gamble on something

471
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,760
帮你弟弟摆脱赌瘾吗
to get your brother out of a gambling problem?

472
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,710
-我又没说我有赌瘾  -说不定你有呢
- I didn't say I had a problem. - I think maybe you do.

473
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,020
如果总赢不输  这就不是问题了
When you always win, it's not a problem.

474
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,650
我觉得我会喜欢你的  伙计
I think I might like you, pal.

475
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,640
路易
Louis.

476
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,910
我收到你的短信  怎么了
I got your message. What's going on?

477
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,350
怎么了  他们想糊弄我
What's going on is, they're trying to screw me,

478
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,630
我要你来唱白脸
and I need you to be bad cop.

479
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,530
什么
What?

480
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,120
您选好了吗  先生
Have you made a decision, sir?

481
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,190
没有  没选好  你个赚死人钱的奸商
No, I haven't made a decision, you shyster dealer of death.

482
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,490
我想我们还需要点时间
Okay, I think maybe we're gonna need another minute.

483
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,830
不  不需要
No, we don't.

484
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,910
我才不需要再选
I don't need another minute to see

485
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,730
这个跟家得宝的水壶似的
that this looks like a pot from Home Depot,

486
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,570
这个像是六号汽车旅馆的台灯
this looks like a lamp from Motel 6,

487
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,510
这个像见鬼的榴弹壳
and this looks like a goddamn howitzer shell.

488
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,710
你真幸运
You are lucky that I don't 

489
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,810
我没把这破罐子
take this mockery of a final resting place

490
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,970
买下来塞你屁眼里
and shove it up your ass.

491
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,860
-路易  够了  -不够
- Louis, that's enough. - No, it's not enough.

492
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,890
我为这破事折腾两天了
I've been handling this bullshit for two days

493
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,940
还是为了那个本应该来帮我做事的女人
for a woman who's supposed to be handling things for me.

494
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,300
路易  你发脾气不是因为骨灰瓮
Louis, this isn't about the urn.

495
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,050
少跟我煽情
Oh, please don't give me that touchy-feely shit.

496
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,690
你为什么不给我唱白脸
And why the hell are you not being bad cop?

497
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,730
因为现在需要的不是这个
Because that's not what's needed.

498
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,640
去他的不是这个
Oh, bullshit it's not what's needed.

499
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,120
-路易  -你一点不关心我
- Louis. - You don't care about me.

500
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,670
你从来不关心我
You never cared about me.

501
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,440
你只关心你自己
All you care about is yourself...

502
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,060
还有你那个蠢姐姐  和你的赫梅尔陶俑
and your stupid sister and your Hummel figurines

503
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,560
还有你的《女作家与谋杀案》重播
and your Murder, She Wrote reruns.

504
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,160
路易  我不是诺玛
Louis, I'm not Norma.

505
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,650
她走了
She's gone...

506
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,010
一切会好起来的
and it's gonna be okay.

507
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,620
她就是个母老虎
She was a battle-ax!

508
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,600
可她是我的母老虎
But she was my battle-ax.

509
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,010
我知道
I know.

510
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,650
她不只抛弃了我
Oh, she didn't just leave me high and dry.

511
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,340
还永远离开了我
She left me for good.

512
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,990
我好伤心
I'm so sorry.

513
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,500
没事了
It's okay.

514
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,670
怎么两个一起来了
Both of you?

515
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,710
我俩都为你工作
We both work for you.

516
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,940
所以我们一起来跟你说
Which is why we're both here to say

517
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,520
也许是时候换个调查方向
maybe it's time we explore other options.

518
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,520
你在开玩笑吧
You got to be kidding me.

519
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,580
你在这上面花了两天
You spent two days on this,

520
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,770
就打算缴械投降了吗
and you're ready to throw in the towel?

521
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,450
我们花了五天中的两天来调查
We've spent two of our five days on it,

522
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,590
依旧一无所获
and we still don't have a name,

523
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,730
-所以我们觉得是时候考虑...  -什么
- so we think it's time to consider-- - What?

524
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,750
调查傅滋曼
Going after Forstman

525
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,650
十二年前对你做的事
for whatever he did to you 12 years ago.

526
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,840
-你告诉她了  -是的
- You told her? - Yes, I did.

527
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,860
正如我刚才所说  我俩都为你工作
Because like I said, we both work for you.

528
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,920
也就是说我俩都想帮忙
Which means we both want to help.

529
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,060
你们以为过去十几年
You think I haven't wondered how to go after Forstman

530
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,770
我就没想过怎么对付傅滋曼吗
100 times in the last dozen years?

531
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,580
那为什么不动手
Then why don't you?

532
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,180
因为有危险的不只我一个
Because I'm not the only one at risk.

533
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,370
你是说你弟弟
You mean your brother.

534
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,390
对
Yes, I do.

535
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,790
我不会把他牵扯进来
And I'm not gonna bring him into this,

536
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,360
因为他什么都没做错
because he didn't do anything wrong.

537
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,780
哈维  我不是说...
Harvey, I'm not saying--

538
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,020
你没听到吗
Did you hear me?

539
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,630
他不只有我的把柄
He doesn't just have a gun to my head, okay?

540
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,550
还有我弟弟的
He's got one to my brother's.

541
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,740
你告诉过我多少遍
And how many times have you told me

542
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,160
当别人有你的把柄
that when someone has a gun to your head,

543
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,370
就换个方式解决问题
you figure a different way out?

544
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,430
这可是查尔斯·傅滋曼
This is Charles Forstman.

545
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,060
-没别的办法  -哈维  有...
- There is no other way out. - Harvey, there's--

546
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,790
我已经派给你活儿了  赶快去干活
I gave you a job to do. Now do your goddamn job.

547
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,050
撞墙了吧
Well, that was a bust.

548
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,380
-总要试试  -是吗
- We had to try. - Did we?

549
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,760
我就说他会生气  他果然生气了
I told you he'd be pissed off, and he was.

550
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,450
你还说他得听听
Yeah, and you also told me he needed to hear things

551
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,350
不想听的事
that he didn't want to hear.

552
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,600
好吧  现在他只听到
Okay, well, now all he heard is,

553
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,470
自己不光不能信任我  你也不可信任
not only can't he trust me, he can't trust you either.

554
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,380
不是这样  你知道的
That's not what he heard, and you know it.

555
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,190
他听到的是  你是我在这个世界上
What he heard was that you're the closest person

556
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,000
最亲近的人
in the world to me,

557
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,550
我永远不会瞒着你
I am never gonna keep things from you,

558
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,410
为他干活的也不只我一个
and I'm not the only one in his corner.

559
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,800
我是你在这个世界上最亲近的人
I'm the closest person in the world to you.

560
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,050
当然了  你怎么可以...
Of course you are. How can you even--

561
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:48,850
我不是在质疑这个
I'm not questioning it.

562
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,430
我是你在这个世界上最亲近的人
I'm the closest person in the world to you,

563
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,380
而我不会上你的族谱
and I wouldn't be on your family tree.

564
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,470
-你是说伍德尔  -没错  我是在说伍德尔
- You're talking about Woodall. - Yes, I'm talking about Woodall.

565
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,410
伍德尔结婚了
Woodall's married.

566
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,550
我们查了他的妻子  什么也没发现
We checked his wife. Nothing.

567
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,110
这就是关键  我们没结婚
That's the thing. We're not married.

568
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,820
好吧  我真的不觉得现在是时候提这个
Okay, I really don't think this is the time to bring that up.

569
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,480
我是认真的
I'm being serious.

570
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,590
我们彻查了每个和他有关系的人
We've exhausted every person that's related to him.

571
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,810
也许是时候找个和他没关系的人了
Maybe it's time we found someone who isn't.

572
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,240
-太天才了  -谢谢
- That's genius. - Thank you.

573
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,930
现在我是真不明白为何哈维不尊重你了
Now I really don't understand why Harvey doesn't respect you.

574
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,780
说早了
It's too soon.

575
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,600
这个玩笑开早了
It's too soon for that joke.

576
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,870
早了
Too soon.

577
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,230
我可以随便选吗
I can have any one?

578
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,450
随便选
Take your pick.

579
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,620
没关系  反正你都会输
It doesn't matter, 'cause you're gonna lose.

580
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,600
真是有趣了
That's funny.

581
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,570
我倒觉得我会赢两次呢
I look at it like I'm gonna win twice.

582
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,890
我要开辆很叼的车  狠狠赢你一把
I get to drive a badass car, and I get to kick your ass.

583
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,670
自大  我喜欢
Cocky. I like that.

584
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,720
像你这种人  我很惊讶你居然可以忍受
A guy like you, I'm surprised you could stand working

585
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,790
替卡梅隆·丹尼斯工作
for Cameron Dennis in the first place.

586
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,810
-什么意思  -他不喜欢自大的人
- What do you mean? - He doesn't like cocky.

587
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,840
就拿那谁  什么名字来着...杜彭
Take, for instance, what's-his-name--DuPont?

588
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,620
他是怎么回事  偷税漏税吗
What's he up for? Tax evasion?

589
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,190
-内幕交易  -是的  随便啦
- Insider trading. - Yeah, whatever.

590
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,160
重点是  在你那天立功了之后
The point is, after what you did the other day,

591
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,240
为什么不是你主导那个案子
why aren't you leading that?

592
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,720
因为这是卡梅隆的案子
Because this is Cameron's case.

593
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,260
假如我是他的话  案子就是你的了
If I were him, it'd be yours.

594
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,240
哈维  你是他的明星选手
Harvey, you are his star player,

595
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
而他却连场都不让你上
and he's not even putting you in the game.

596
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,260
更重要的是
And on top of that,

597
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,570
他没胆量宣告他到底要不要查杜彭
he didn't have the balls to announce whether he's going after DuPont or not.

598
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,110
你就不操心卡梅隆·丹尼斯了
Don't you worry about Cameron Dennis.

599
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,050
杜彭会罪有应得的
DuPont's gonna get what's coming to him.

600
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,130
我就是想听这句话
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

601
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,760
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

602
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,310
你忠于的雇主
Well, you're loyal to the guy you work for.

603
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,480
我喜欢
I like that.

604
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,780
所以你刚刚就说他坏话
So you were just talking shit about him

605
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,440
看看我会不会上钩吗
to see if I'd jump on board?

606
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,820
而你没上钩...
And you didn't...

607
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,210
因此我们也没必要赛车了
which is why we don't have to race anymore.

608
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,300
你是说我得到了这份工作吗
You're saying I got the job?

609
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,060
欢迎加入
I'm saying welcome to the team.

610
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,740
这一切都很棒  查尔斯
Well, that's all well and good, Charles,

611
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,790
但我们还是要赛一场
but we're still racing.

612
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,090
当然要赛
We sure as hell are.

613
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,290
只不过需要另寻一个赌注了
We just have to find something else to bet on.

614
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,460
你好啊  肖恩  见到你真高兴
Hey, Sean. Good to see you.

615
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,660
别给我来这套
Don't give me that shit.

616
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,690
你昨天早上在埃里克·伍德尔的超市里
Did you confront Eric Woodall yesterday morning

617
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,790
遇见他了吗
at his supermarket?

618
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,340
我们偶然碰上了
I ran into him by accident.

619
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,780
我喜欢那家超市的农产品
I like the produce there.

620
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,050
我现在没心情开玩笑  哈维
I'm not in the mood, Harvey.

621
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,150
你是接近了证监会调查中的涉案人员
Did you approach the subject of an SEC investigation

622
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,340
特意为了恐吓他吗
with the express purpose of intimidating him?

623
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
我接近他是为了
I approached him with the express purpose

624
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,260
让他雇我做他的律师
of hiring me as his lawyer.

625
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,170
你到底为什么要那样做
Why the hell would you do that?

626
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,420
你应该是来帮我的
You're supposed to be helping me.

627
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,500
假如他愿意承认自己做了什么
And if he's willing to admit what he did,

628
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,340
那就帮到你了
that is helping you.

629
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,300
相反  他声称我派你去那里恐吓他
And instead, he's claiming that i sent you there to intimidate him.

630
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,440
我猜这就是突破的方式
Then I guess that's the way it's breaking.

631
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,570
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

632
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,230
他要么选择买我的帐
He's either gonna buy what I'm selling

633
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,540
要么掩饰自己留下的痕迹
or cover his tracks.

634
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,390
假如他要掩饰痕迹  你就得在他身边
And if he covers his tracks, you need to be there.

635
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,110
你是叫我跟踪他吗
Are you asking me to follow him?

636
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,010
不  我是告诉你要跟踪他
No, I'm telling you to follow him.

637
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,950
我不能那样做  我没有权限
I can't do that. I don't have authorization.

638
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,940
那你还跟踪我
Didn't stop you following me.

639
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,090
够了
Enough.

640
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,320
他要控告我骚扰
He's filing charges of harassment against me.

641
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,320
我们这样做根本没用
We do this, nothing sticks.

642
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,390
那也许我们没办法抓到他了
Then we might not get him,

643
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,460
因为我手上什么也没有
because I have nothing.

644
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,080
让我给你一点额外的动力
Well, let me give you a little extra motivation.

645
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,910
记住  伍德尔知道一切关于路易·利特的
Remember, Woodall knows all about

646
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,370
那点和傅滋曼有关的小罪行
Louis Litt's little Forstman transgression.

647
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,460
所以假如他被证明无罪
So if he gets exonerated,

648
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,800
你觉得他第一个会找谁报仇
who do you think's gonna be the first person he goes after?

649
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,770
所以  与其去新泽西买你的农产品
So, instead of going to Jersey for your produce,

650
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,440
还不如弄点我能用得上的东西
go get me something I can use.

651
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,410
怎么在一个人喝闷酒
You're having a drink by yourself?

652
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,690
发生什么事情了
What's going on?

653
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,460
发生的事情是
What's going on is,

654
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,680
我刚刚让人把杰夫的名字从他门上刮下来了
I just finished having them scrape Jeff's name off his door.

655
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,650
你不说说你为什么在这里吗  哈维
So why don't you tell me why you're here, Harvey?

656
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,340
卡荷尔找不到证据
Cahill's having trouble getting evidence

657
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,840
指控傅滋曼和伍德尔
against Forstman and Woodall.

658
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,910
我知道
I'm aware of that.

659
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,240
那你也应该知道
Then you should also be aware that

660
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,320
假如伍德尔保住了他的工作
if Woodall keeps his job,

661
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,640
他就会去找路易的麻烦了
he's likely to go after Louis.

662
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,440
我能想明白那点  你也可以
I could've done that math, and so could you,

663
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,420
所以...
so...

664
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,210
我也许可以帮他们抓到傅滋曼...
I might be able to help them get Forstman...

665
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,610
通过别的事情
on something else.

666
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,070
这和他12年前
Does this have something to do

667
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,580
给你那份工作的事有关系吗
with when he offered you that job 12 years ago?

668
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,920
有关
Yes.

669
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,640
我说了那人是个大麻烦
I told you that man was trouble.

670
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,890
我也说了我不会放弃马库斯
And I told you I wouldn't abandon Marcus

671
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,580
而且你看错他了
and you were wrong about him.

672
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,070
所以这事还和马库斯有关
So this has something to do with Marcus.

673
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,360
是的
Yes, it does.

674
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,480
如果你是想让我在
Well, if you are asking me to choose

675
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,820
你弟弟和路易之间做选择  你知道结果
between your brother and Louis, you know who I'm choosing.

676
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,110
我没让你做选择
I'm not asking you to do that.

677
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,930
那你想让我干什么
Then what are you asking?

678
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,090
我想让你帮我整理思路
I want your help to get my mind right.

679
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,610
问题在于  哈维
Here's the thing, Harvey.

680
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,940
杰夫走了
Jeff's gone,

681
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,720
而他离开是我做的选择导致的
and he's gone because of the choices I made.

682
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,170
所以我不知道我能否为你整理思路
So I'm not sure if I can help you get your mind right,

683
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,380
因为眼下
'cause right now...

684
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,840
我的也是一团糟
mine's not right.

685
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,640
失陪一下
Hang on a sec.

686
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,200
你来这儿不只是为了通知我上班时间吧
You didn't come down here just to give me my start date.

687
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,300
我来是为了告诉你
I came down here to tell you

688
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,810
我觉得你很特殊
I think you have something special,

689
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,000
我也很愿意让你为我工作
and I'd love nothing more than to have you on my desk,

690
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,690
但我就要辞去检察官的职位了
but I'm leaving the DA's office.

691
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,990
这和那天请你喝酒的那个
Does this have something to do with that Forstman guy

692
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,670
傅滋曼有关吗
buying you a drink the other night?

693
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,400
你不是不认识他吗
I thought you didn't know who he was.

694
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,670
我查了查他的底细
Well, I looked him up

695
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,940
因为我以为以后要为你工作了
because I thought I was gonna be working for you.

696
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,350
而且我告诉你  他很坏
And I'm telling you, he's shady.

697
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,130
就因为他名声不好吗
Because he's got a bad reputation?

698
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,060
我才不在乎他的名声
I don't care what his reputation is.

699
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,770
你还不了解我  我很会看人
You don't know this about me yet, but I know people...

700
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,300
我对他们的了解有时比他们自己还透彻
usually better than they know themselves.

701
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,360
所以我知道你是个好人
And the same way I know you are a good person,

702
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,660
我还可以告诉你那个人可坏到家了
I can tell you that man is rotten to the core.

703
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,890
你只是为了说服我
You're just trying to get me to stay

704
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,310
让你做我的秘书
so you can work at my desk.

705
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,440
听着
Listen to me.

706
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,080
我不在乎你要不要雇我
I don't care whether I work on your desk or not.

707
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,170
为那个人干活绝对是个大错误
You're making a mistake if you take a job with that man.

708
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,510
那恐怕我在犯大错误了
Then I guess I'm making a mistake,

709
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,780
因为我已经接受了他的邀请
because I already did.

710
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,010
认识你很高兴  唐娜
It was nice knowing you, Donna.

711
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,990
所以你最终还是决定留下她了
So you're keeping her here after all.

712
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,350
在你把我弄哭后  我也没办法
Yeah, I couldn't throw her off the roof

713
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,840
把她从屋顶撒下去了
after you got me to cry.

714
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,040
太好了
I'm glad.

715
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,770
唐娜  我都不知道该怎么感谢你
Donna, I can't thank you enough for what you did.

716
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,830
不用客气  路易
Oh, you're welcome, Louis.

717
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,260
事实是  这让我也好了很多
The truth is, I needed this more than you know.

718
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,770
我理解
Well, I get it.

719
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,220
你需要分分神
You needed a distraction

720
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,920
因为刚刚过去的这些麻烦事
after everything you just went through.

721
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,450
是啊  算是吧
Uh, yeah. Something like that.

722
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,660
老实说
Truth is,

723
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,940
我自己也需要分分神
I could use a distraction myself.

724
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,440
还有件事你需要做
Well, there is one thing that you still need to do.

725
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,260
你得开始想着找新秘书了
You need to start thinking about a new secretary.

726
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,330
唐娜  我知道我已经问过你了
Donna, I know I've asked you this before,

727
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,260
但现在我们的关系比当时近多了  而且
but we're so much closer now than we were then, and--

728
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,780
路易  我为哈维工作
Louis, I work for Harvey.

729
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,770
你知道我不能当你的秘书
You know I can't be your secretary.

730
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,730
但我们心意相通啊
But we have this bond...

731
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,070
你和我
you and I.

732
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,030
我们都喜欢莎士比亚  喜欢射击俱乐部
Shakespeare, the gun club.

733
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,130
我们一向有共同语言  你自己也知道的
We've always spoken the same language, and you know it.

734
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,100
路易  我不能这么做
Louis, I can't.

735
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,390
我理解
I get it.

736
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,140
我们还是当朋友更好些
We're better as friends.

737
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,820
不如我为诺玛办场小型告别会吧
How about I set up a little farewell for Norma

738
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,120
作为你临时秘书的最后一项工作
as my last official act as your interim secretary?

739
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,630
谢谢你  唐娜
Thank you, Donna.

740
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,690
你确定地址没错吗
Are you sure we've got the right address?

741
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,000
确定
I'm positive.

742
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,650
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

743
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,570
有什么能帮您的吗
Can I help you?

744
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,500
我们想找玛丽·安·玛葛拉
Uh, yes, is there a Mary Ann McGrath here?

745
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,570
请问您是哪位
Who can I say is asking?

746
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,790
我们来自皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特
We're with Pearson Specter Litt.

747
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,220
我们想就一桩调查中的案子和她谈谈
We'd like to speak with her in regards to an ongoing case.

748
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,700
我想这恐怕不行
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

749
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,120
你刚说她在的  我不明白
You just said she was here. I don't understand--

750
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,460
玛丽·安得了老年痴呆症
Mary Ann has advanced Alzheimer's.

751
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,250
但她才55岁
But she's 55.

752
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,290
是早发性的  而且她的症状尤其严重
It's early onset, and hers is particularly aggressive.

753
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,090
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

754
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,550
能告诉我们她患病多久了吗
Can I ask how long she's been a patient?

755
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,560
我们不能透露病人信息
We're not supposed to disclose any--

756
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,430
拜托  这事很重要
Please. It's really important.

757
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,010
她是一年半左右前被转来这里的
She was moved her about a year and a half ago.

758
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,160
那之前呢
And before that?

759
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,550
我不太清楚
I don't really know,

760
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,160
但我想之前她受到的治疗不怎么好
but I don't think she was getting the best care.

761
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,070
谢谢
Thank you.

762
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,900
我妈妈才55岁
My mother's 55.

763
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,030
如果她能来这里是因为傅滋曼的资助
You know, and if she's only here because Forstman pays for it--

764
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,920
我知道
I know.

765
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,910
哈维要我们找到
Harvey wants us to find

766
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,450
伍德尔亲近的人
the person Woodall's close to.

767
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,400
我们也没什么能做的
That's all we can do.

768
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,350
我们没什么能做的
Well, "All we can do"

769
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,420
意味着再送她回一个条件很差的医院
is gonna send her back to some horrible facility.

770
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,160
-那也不一定  -肯定的
- We don't exactly know that. - Yes, we do.

771
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,360
瑞秋  这确实很糟糕
Rachel, it's terrible.

772
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,490
我跟你一样不喜欢这样
I don't like it any more than you do,

773
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,080
但这不取决于我们
but it's not up to us.

774
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,860
我知道
I know.

775
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,910
糟透了
It just sucks.

776
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,350
你个该死的骗子
You goddamn liar.

777
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,620
别生气
Oh, don't be mad.

778
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,080
没错  肯奇塔告诉大家我不在家
Yeah, Conchita tells everybody I'm not home.

779
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,710
你知道我在说什么
You know what I'm talking about.

780
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,950
杜彭投资今天跌停了
DuPont Investments dropped through the floor today,

781
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,860
而你抛空了
and you sold short

782
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,380
根据我私下告诉你的信息
based on something that I told you in confidence.

783
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,880
我不记得你告诉过我什么
I don't recall you telling me anything at all.

784
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,990
你个婊子养的
You son of a bitch.

785
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,050
这次交易你赚了1亿多美元
You made over $100 million on that trade.

786
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,380
是啊  没错
Yeah, I did.

787
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,110
欢迎来到现实世界  伙计
Welcome to the real world, pal.

788
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,780
我的现实世界里可不会跟年轻检察官交友
My real world doesn't involve befriending young attorneys

789
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,370
以获得内幕信息
to get inside information.

790
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,700
也许你跟我真的合不来
Maybe you're not the right man for me after all.

791
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,360
你觉得发生了这些事我还想为你工作吗
You think I still want to work for you after this?

792
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,270
你想要赢得竞争和钱
You wanted competition and money.

793
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,120
你赢得了竞争
You got the competition.

794
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,850
这里还有你的钱
Here's your money.

795
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,620
你自己留着那100万吧
You can shove that $1 million up your ass,

796
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,960
因为我不仅不会接受你的工作
because I'm not only not taking your job,

797
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,190
我还要起诉你
I'm gonna prosecute you.

798
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,590
那你在起诉书里也得写上你的名字
Then you might as well add your name to the indictment

799
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,420
既然你已经跟我共享收益
since you've already shared in the profits.

800
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,910
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

801
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,480
看看这张支票吧
Take a look at this check.

802
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,150
不是100万
It's not $1 million.

803
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,060
是85万
It's 850,000.

804
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,510
我猜你知道另外15万上哪儿去了
Bet you can guess where the other $150,000 went.

805
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,000
你干了什么
What did you do?

806
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,610
你知道我干了什么
You know what I did.

807
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,450
马库斯跟这事毫无关系
Marcus had nothing to do with this.

808
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,590
如果你马上答应了  他确实是没关系
He wouldn't have had you said yes right away.

809
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,800
但你没有
But you didn't.

810
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,510
我们会把钱还给你
We're giving you the money back.

811
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,410
你会伤透了他的心的
You're gonna break his little heart.

812
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,590
他以为这钱是你给的
He thinks that money came from you.

813
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,930
你从赌徒手里把钱抢走
And you snatch cash out of an addicted gambler's hands,

814
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,440
夺走他的梦想
take away his dream,

815
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,400
那这个故事只有一个结局
only one way that story ends.

816
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,320
所以你要么继续生气
So you can either pout about it...

817
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,430
要么接受现实  然后向大家证明
or you can embrace it and prove to everyone I was right

818
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,920
我说你有特别之处  是对的
when I said I saw something special in you.

819
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,170
风水轮流转  查尔斯
Someday the shoe's gonna be on the other foot, Charles.

820
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,290
我见过的每个输家都这么说
Words spoken by every loser I've ever met.

821
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,930
回见  伙计
See you around, pal.

822
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,530
是伍德尔的发妻
It's Woodall's first wife.

823
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,800
她名叫玛丽·安  他们一起长大
Her name's Mary Ann. They grew up together.

824
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,000
21岁时结婚
They got married when they were 21

825
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,850
6个月后离婚
and had it annulled six months later.

826
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,240
那笔钱是做什么用的
And what's the money for?

827
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,620
-她得了老年痴呆症  -别告诉我
- She has Alzheimer's. - Don't tell me.

828
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,080
他让她住进高级疗养院
He moved her to a high-end facility

829
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,360
支付24小时监护费
and pays for round-the-clock care.

830
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,960
问题是  我们给处理账单的
And the problem is, we called the company

831
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,860
公司打了电话  然后
that handles the billing, and--

832
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,630
全用现金支付
And everything's in cash up front,

833
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,290
可能还预支了五年的费用
probably paid five years in advance.

834
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:34,930
但玛丽·安没法告诉你  因为她不能说话
And Mary Ann couldn't tell you because she doesn't speak.

835
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,010
所以我们根本没有证据
Which mean we don't have any proof.

836
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,640
你要去哪
Where are you going?

837
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,560
我去找证据
I'm gonna go get us some proof.

838
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,820
这是你发现的吗
You did this?

839
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,020
迈克和我一起
Mike and I both did.

840
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,570
那他为什么没来
Then why isn't he here?

841
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,900
你知道原因
You know why.

842
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,630
因为功劳大半在你
Because it was more you than him.

843
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,740
干得不错  瑞秋
You did a good job, Rachel.

844
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,000
购物  租碟
Shopping, renting videos.

845
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,320
你一定快被逼疯了吧
You must be going stir-crazy.

846
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,980
没关系
That's all right.

847
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,480
我停职期快满了
My suspension is about to expire.

848
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,710
对啊  换作是我可不敢指望
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.

849
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,220
我们发现玛丽·安了
We found Mary Ann.

850
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,240
我听说她在新疗养院过得不错
I'm told she's doing well at the new facility--

851
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,170
傅滋曼的公司付钱的那家
you know, the one Forstman's paying for.

852
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,090
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

853
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,850
我不是来利用你的悲剧  埃里克
I'm not here to exploit your tragedy, Eric.

854
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,100
我是来告诉你  一切都结束了
I'm here to tell you it's over.

855
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,250
如果真的结束了
Well, if this were over,

856
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,310
你现在会跟跟肖恩·卡荷尔在一起
you'd be with Sean Cahill right now,

857
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,600
所以你是来找我达成协议的
which means you're still looking for me to cut a deal.

858
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,550
我是来找你对付傅滋曼的
I'm looking for you to turn on Forstman.

859
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,650
你三天内两次来找我
You accost me for the second time in three days

860
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,270
还搬出了玛丽·安的名字
and throw Mary Ann's name around

861
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,120
作为你的谈判筹码
like a bargaining chip,

862
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,820
你觉得我会帮你吗
and you think I'm gonna help you?

863
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,560
去死吧
Drop dead.

864
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,050
埃里克  拜托了
Eric, please.

865
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,260
我知道要找一个你在乎的人
The reason I knew to look for someone that you cared about

866
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,340
是因为傅滋曼也那样对过我
was that Forstman did the same thing to me.

867
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,020
他发现你的弱点  然后利用弱点
He finds your weakness and presses down

868
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,590
直到你不愿再对抗他
until you don't have the will to stand up to him.

869
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,440
你的弱点是得了老年痴呆症的前妻
With you, it was an ex-wife with Alzheimer's.

870
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,660
而我
With me...

871
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,520
就是有赌瘾的弟弟
it was a little brother addicted to gambling.

872
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,650
我才不管
I don't care.

873
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,840
你没证据
You don't have proof,

874
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,010
再过一天你也找不到
and you're not gonna get it in the next 24 hours.

875
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,290
你说得对  我没有
You're right. I don't.

876
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,770
可问题是
But here's the thing.

877
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,740
卡荷尔可能有截止日期  但我没有
Cahill may have a deadline, but I don't,

878
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,610
我也不在乎要花多长时间
and I don't care how long it takes,

879
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,220
要是你不去对付傅滋曼的话
because I'm gonna find that proof

880
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,040
我一定会对那份证据追查到底
if you don't turn on Forstman.

881
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,590
很多人不知道这事
A lot of you don't know this,

882
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,100
但实际上  我恨死诺玛了
but the truth is, I hated Norma.

883
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,920
我讨厌她的木屐
I hated her clogs,

884
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,290
她的胡子
her mustache,

885
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,590
又丑又傻的应季毛衣
her stupid seasonal sweaters.

886
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,960
但我最讨厌的是
But the thing I hated most about her

887
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,590
她老是喜欢炫耀
was her favorite story

888
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,520
1975年阿贝·维高达[美国演员]向她求过婚
about how Abe Vigoda asked her to marry him in 1975.

889
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,970
大家都懂的
I mean, we get it.

890
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,490
你美丽又性感
You were hot.

891
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,620
拒绝他的求婚
You turned him down,

892
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,590
是你这辈子最后悔的事
and it was the biggest regret of your life.

893
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,950
就像你说过的所有事一样
And like everything you ever said,

894
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,100
当时令我难以忍受
I couldn't stand it at the time.

895
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,440
但现在你不在了
But now that you're gone,

896
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,470
我终于明白你话里的含义
I understand what you meant.

897
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,570
莫错过光阴
Don't let the moment pass.

898
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,130
莫在未表白心意前
Don't let the people you love walk by you

899
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,480
就放手爱人  任其离开
without letting them know how you feel about them,

900
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,330
因为放手一瞬  后悔一生
because life slips by, and then it's over.

901
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,180
现在我要告诉你  你对我来说有多重要
And I'm not gonna let another minute pass me by

902
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,680
不会再让一分一秒从身边溜走
without letting you know how much you mean to me.

903
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,300
诺玛  我爱你
I love you, Norma.

904
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,090
谢谢  路易
Thank you, Louis.

905
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,740
致辞很感人
That was a lovely ceremony.

906
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,810
说的真好  路易
That was beautiful, Louis.

907
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,420
没有你我做不到的
I couldn't have done it without you.

908
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,680
-你就别谦虚了  -本来就是
- Oh, that's not true. - Yeah, it is.

909
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,710
没有你点醒我  我都不知道自己的感受
I couldn't even see how I felt without you showing me.

910
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,550
事实是  唐娜
And the truth is, Donna,

911
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,120
你比我自己还要了解我
you know me better than I know myself.

912
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,030
就像我之前说的  哈维根本不知道
Like I said, Harvey has no idea

913
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,460
拥有你是多幸运的一件事
how lucky he is to have you.

914
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,990
是在找我可能给埃里克·伍德尔的那笔钱吗
Looking for the money I supposedly gave Eric Woodall?

915
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,290
你是来直接认罪  帮我省事的吗
You want to save me the trouble and just admit what you did?

916
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,790
不是  要是那样还有什么意思
No, where would be the fun in that?

917
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,160
好  你继续玩吧
Fine. Keep playing your games,

918
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,930
但这一次  你必败无疑
but this time, you're gonna lose.

919
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,050
为什么  你以为你说服了伍德尔供出我吗
Why, because you think you convinced Woodall to give me up?

920
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,760
没错  他来找我了
Yeah, he came to see me.

921
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,320
说你想让他出卖我
Said you tried to get him to turn me in.

922
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,220
我说的是  你是个傲慢的混蛋
What I said was, you're an arrogant bastard

923
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,490
整天盘算着怎么利用别人
who's spent his life manipulating people.

924
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,890
那你就是个只关心输赢的废柴
And you're the loser who only cares about competition.

925
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,910
赢不了我  怪我咯
Not my fault you can't beat me.

926
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,100
这次我可以
I can this time.

927
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,620
我不觉得  伙计  因为...
Oh, I don't think so, pal, because...

928
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,440
他卖我  我就卖你
he turns on me, I turn on you.

929
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,850
如果你说的是十二年前的那件事  容我提醒下
If you're talking about 12 years ago, let me remind you.

930
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,240
我们都参与其中了
We were both part of that deal.

931
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,650
是的
Yes, we were.

932
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,760
我们三个都参与了  我  你  和你弟弟
All three of us were-- you, me, and your brother.

933
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,230
你别把我弟弟搅和进来
You leave my brother out of this.

934
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,330
想都别想
Not a chance.

935
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,420
要是你非让伍德尔搅和进来
And you don't leave this Woodall thing alone,

936
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,250
那么我完蛋的那天
by the time I'm done,

937
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,640
所有人都会知道十二年前
all anybody will know about 12 years ago

938
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,190
是你给了条建议
is you gave me a tip

939
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,410
确保你的弟弟能从中获利
and made sure your little brother profited from it.

940
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,160
我屁都没有给过你
I didn't give you shit.

941
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,950
你骗我给你透内部消息
You tricked me into giving you inside information

942
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,150
然后给马库斯
and then blackmailed me

943
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,980
他自己都不知道是赃款的钱来勒索我
by giving Marcus money he didn't even know was dirty.

944
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,530
那或许是真相
That may be the truth,

945
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,310
但他们不会从我这里听到
but they're never gonna hear it from me.

946
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,520
恐怕他们刚刚就听到了
I'm afraid they just did.

947
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,680
你好啊  查尔斯
Hi, Charles.

948
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,600
我是肖恩·卡荷尔  很高兴见到你
Sean Cahill. Nice to meet you.

949
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,450
你他妈是谁
Who the hell are you?

950
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,400
我是证监会里还没被你收买的人
I'm the guy from the SEC that isn't in your pocket.

951
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,610
我让肖恩去跟踪伍德尔
I asked Sean to follow Woodall.

952
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,360
做不到  我没有权限
Couldn't. No authorization.

953
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,490
但是要获得跟踪你的授权
But I had no problem getting authorization

954
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,490
就没什么难度
to follow you.

955
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,750
所以我才知道什么时候该把它打开
Which is how I knew when to turn this on.

956
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,750
你竟然戴了窃听器
You're wearing a goddamn wire?

957
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,520
某人还说自己最爱的电影是《华尔街》呢
For someone whose favorite movie is Wall Street,

958
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,200
这都没发现  真是丢人啊
that's got to be pretty embarrassing.

959
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,240
你个混蛋
Son of a bitch.

960
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,200
查尔斯  十二年前你或许赢了我
You may have gotten the better of me 12 years ago, Charles,

961
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,930
但这次  你没有
but this time, you didn't.

962
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,080
记住这种感觉  因为我知道我会的
So remember what it feels like, because I know I will.

963
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,250
哈维  这事没完
Harvey, this isn't over.

964
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:14,020
我见过的每个输家都这么说
Words spoken by every loser I've ever met.

965
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,570
回见  伙计
See you around, pal.

966
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,120
二换二
Two for two.

967
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,470
他没碰我的球
He didn't touch my balls.

968
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,100
黑咖  两块方糖  再加一点香草
Black, two sugars, splash of vanilla.

969
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,640
你怎么知道我喝咖啡的习惯
How do you know that's how I take my coffee?

970
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,660
我也知道你不会接受这份工作的
The same way I know you're not taking that job.

971
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,970
你知道我不会接是因为我今天来上班了
You know I'm not taking that job because I came into work today.

972
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,300
不  斯佩克特先生
No, Mr. Specter.

973
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,520
那天晚上你从我身边走开的时候
I knew you weren't taking that job

974
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,970
我就知道你不会接那份工作
the second you walked away from me the other night.

975
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,550
早跟你说过我对别人的了解比他们自己还透彻
I told you I know people better than they know themselves.

976
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,000
那蒂娜怎么办
Well, what did you do with Tina?

977
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,580
我让贝莎重新分配了
Oh, I had Big Bertha reassign her.

978
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,360
-分给谁了  -你真的关心吗
- To who? - Do you really care?

979
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,040
-毫不关心  -很好
- Not a bit. - Good.

980
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,400
条件是这样
Here's the deal.

981
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,720
我可以为你挡子弹
I will take a bullet for you.

982
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,990
当然不是在说真的子弹
And I don't mean that literally.

983
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,040
但是你要为我做的是
But what you do for me is,

984
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,800
我需要什么的时候  你也要给我
when I need something, you give it to me.

985
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,540
我们的合作是互相的
It's not just a one-way street.

986
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,130
此外你还会真正做秘书的工作吗
Will you also do some actual secretarial work?

987
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,100
看我是怎么安排你的日程表的  牛人
Take a look at what I did with your calendar there, hotshot.

988
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,590
老天啊
Holy shit.

989
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,120
你什么时候做好的
When'd you get that done?

990
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,230
我说过我不是一般的秘书
I told you I'm not like every other secretary.

991
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,330
我可是唐娜
I'm Donna.

992
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,220
那我们开始工作吧
Then let's get to work.

993
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,490
不过顺便说一句  我喝咖啡不加香草
But for the record, I don't take vanilla with my coffee.

994
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,280
你尝过以后就会加了
You will after you taste that.

995
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,360
天呐  真好喝
Oh, my God, this is awesome.

996
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,340
这些人什么时候才会明白
When will they learn?

997
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,770
正是时候
Perfect timing.

998
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,540
而我们要庆祝什么
And what are we celebrating?

999
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,830
我们的胜利
Our win.

1000
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,470
"我们的胜利"
"Our win."

1001
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,320
-我喜欢这说法  -我也喜欢
- I like the sound of that. - Me too.

1002
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,630
你去哪了
Where were you?

1003
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,290
我一会再说
I'll get into that in a minute.

1004
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,120
我想先和你谈谈
I want to talk to you for a second.

1005
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,330
怎么了
What is it?

1006
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:10,660
瑞秋  你知道我告诉过你我爱你
Rachel, you know I told you I loved you

1007
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,170
第一次见面我就说过
from the second I met you.

1008
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,110
你爱我的铅笔裙
Well, you loved my pencil skirt.

1009
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,660
我爱你的面容
I loved your face.

1010
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,910
你是我见过的最出色的女人
You're the most amazing woman I have ever met,

1011
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,170
你不止美貌
and you're not just beautiful,

1012
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:34,310
而且还甜美  善良  关心人
but you're sweet and caring and kind

1013
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,970
而且聪明坚强
and brilliant and tenacious.

1014
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,250
迈克  你...
Mike, are--

1015
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,110
你是在做我认为你在做的那件事吗
are you doing what I think you're doing?

1016
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,330
我今天给你父亲打过电话了
I called your father today.

1017
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,880
然后我又把奶奶的戒指送去清洗干净了
And then I went to get Grammy's ring cleaned.

1018
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,120
天...
Oh, my--

1019
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,270
我不想花四十年时间
I don't want to go 40 years

1020
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,490
后悔自己为什么没早一天这样做
wondering why I didn't do this one day sooner.

1021
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,490
瑞秋·伊丽莎白·赞恩
Rachel Elizabeth Zane...

1022
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,720
我爱你
I love you...

1023
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,500
永生永世
and I always will.

1024
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,320
你是我生命的全部
You're my whole life.

1025
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,070
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

1026
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,100
愿意
Yes.

1027
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,700
-愿意吗  -愿意
- Yes? - Yes.

1028
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,110
好  来
All right, here...

1029
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,610
天呐
Oh, my God.

1030
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,730
太漂亮了
It's beautiful.

1031
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,660
她一直戴了近六十年
She wore it every day for almost 60 years.

1032
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,550
我也会的
So will I.

1033
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,460
你好啊  蠢货
What's up, dickhead?

1034
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,400
你好啊  笨蛋
What's up, loser?

1035
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,320
哈维  听到你的声音真好
Hey, Harvey. Good to hear from you.

1036
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,940
怎么了  一切都还好吗
What's going on? Everything okay?

1037
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,570
没事  一切都很好
Yeah, everything's okay.

1038
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,010
我只是有段时间没和你说话了
I just haven't talked to you in a while

1039
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,430
想看看你怎么样
and wanted to see how you were doing.

1040
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,910
我很好  凯蒂也很好
I'm great. Katie's good.

1041
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,690
孩子们都很好  一切都好
The kids are good. Everything's good.

1042
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,390
太棒了
Great.

1043
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,790
我就想听到这个
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

1044
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,770
你确定没有别的事吗
You sure there's nothing going on?

1045
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,950
没有
Nothing.

1046
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,080
就像我刚才说的  我有段时间没跟你说话了
Like I said, I just haven't talked to you in a while,

1047
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,370
我想你了
and I miss you.

1048
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,440
我也想你  哈维  但除非你还有别的事
I miss you too, Harvey, but unless you got something else,

1049
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,310
我得挂了
I've got to go.

1050
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,730
我在给孩子们洗澡呢
The kids are in the bath.

1051
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,360
没别的事了
Nothing else.

1052
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,740
爱你  哈维
Love you, Harvey.

1053
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,160
我也爱你
I love you too.

1054
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,410
听我说  我考虑过你说的话了
Listen, I was thinking about what you said,

1055
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,150
关于我同情你
about me pitying you.

1056
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,510
我不是同情你
And I don't.

1057
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,790
绝对不是那回事
Nothing could be further from the truth.

1058
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,820
我认为你是我认识的最出色的女人之一
I think you're one of the most amazing women I've ever met,

1059
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,020
而仅仅因为我不...
and just because I don't--

1060
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,780
-我要离开你了  哈维  -什么
- I'm leaving you, Harvey. - What?

1061
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,640
你的甜言蜜语对我不管用了
This isn't working for me anymore.

1062
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,910
唐娜  我明白你的感受
Donna, I know how you're feeling,

1063
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,880
但你刚经历过太多大事
but you just went through something huge,

1064
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,650
受审什么的
with being on trial, and, uh...

1065
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,510
你需要过些时间再说
you need to give it time.

1066
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,440
不能就这样辞职
You can't just quit.

1067
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,260
我不是要辞职
I'm not quitting.

1068
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,490
我要去为路易工作
I'm going to work for Louis.

1069
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,500
唐娜
Donna.

1070
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,730
唐娜  拜托
Donna, please.

1071
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,220
我爱你  哈维
I love you, Harvey.
