《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on Suits

8
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,030
-杰夫  -杰西卡  你说的对
- Jeff... - Jessica, you were right.

9
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,980
要么两者兼得  要么两者皆失
We either need to have both, or it's not going to work.

10
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,030
此刻起  我提出辞职
Effective immediately, I'm tendering my resignation.

11
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,840
傅滋曼可不会做没有回报
Forstman doesn't throw money around

12
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,400
白白撒钱的亏本生意
without getting something in return.

13
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,030
他会赚到钱
He's gonna get money in return.

14
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,470
他的心中钱只排在第三位
Money is third on his list.

15
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,360
前两位是报复人
The first two are getting back at people

16
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,750
和控制人
and getting control of people.

17
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,320
你这个混蛋
Son of a bitch.

18
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,030
你让我来不是为了让你签字
You didn't bring me here for you to sign on the arrows.

19
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,010
而是为了让我签字
You brought me here for me to sign on the arrows.

20
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:24,950
没错
Yep.

21
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,490
伍德尔失去工作后
After Woodall lost his job,

22
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,500
傅滋曼把他安排到了证监会
Forstman got him installed at the S.E.C.,

23
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,300
证据在哪里
Where's the proof?

24
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,780
在埃里克·伍德尔的银行账户里
In Eric Woodall's bank accounts.

25
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,000
太可笑了
This is ridiculous.

26
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,410
我是你上司
I'm your boss.

27
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,930
先生们  给我一分钟
Gentlemen, give me a minute.

28
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,500
你就是逼我
You're forcing me to turn you in 

29
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,210
检举你12年前做的事情
for what you did 12 years ago.

30
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,480
你不会的
You're not gonna do that,

31
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,990
因为你也牵涉其中了  伙计
because you did it too, pal.

32
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,130
其他人对我失去信心
Anyone else every loses faith in me,

33
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,210
我根本不在乎
it doesn't matter.

34
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,370
但你不行
But with you, it's different.

35
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,970
我该走了
I should go.

36
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,440
为什么
Why?

37
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,710
你知道我爱你  唐娜
You know I love you, Donna.

38
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,880
敬哈维
To Harvey.

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,860
敬哈维  干杯
To Harvey. Cheers.

40
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,250
杰伊  给我杯麦卡伦18年
Jay, can I get a Macallan 18?

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,760
要知道  一般来说第一次胜诉
You know, usually when someone wins their first trial,

42
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,630
至少会假装把助理地检官同事们
they at least pretend to finish the drink

43
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,210
买的酒喝完
their fellow ADAs bought them.

44
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,440
抱歉  我们...
I'm sorry, do we--

45
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,690
认识吗  还不呢
Know each other? Not yet.

46
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,180
但今天你走运
But today's your lucky day.

47
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,370
为什么
And why is that?

48
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,250
因为你今天能结识唐娜
Because it's the day you get to meet Donna.

49
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,230
我猜猜  你就是唐娜
And let me guess. You're Donna.

50
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,630
你可不知道我有多唐娜
Oh, you have no idea how Donna I am.

51
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,220
-好吧  唐娜  我是哈维...  -斯佩克特
- Well, Donna, I'm Harvey-- - Harvey Specter.

52
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,380
你觉得我要是不知道你是谁
You really think I'd be talking to you

53
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,440
还会跟你说话吗
if I didn't know who you were?

54
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,390
那你究竟怎么知道我的
And how exactly do you know about me?

55
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,490
我知道所有人
I know about everybody.

56
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,250
我不知道的是
What I don't know is

57
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,350
为什么选这个案子作为你的法庭处子秀
why this is the first case you ever took to trial.

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,970
因为是白领犯罪
Because it was a white-collar crime,

59
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,490
不是街角的毒贩
not some drug dealer on a corner,

60
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,780
所以这种案子
which makes it the kind of case--

61
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,100
能让你上报纸
That puts your name in the paper.

62
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,740
你不仅是长得美  是吧
You're not just a pretty face, are you?

63
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,880
的确
No, I'm not.

64
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,550
所以或许你该请我一杯酒
So maybe you should buy me a drink,

65
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,510
我们可以去角落里继续对话
and we can continue this conversation in the corner.

66
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,610
杰伊
Jay?

67
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,190
肖恩  你大晚上的
Sean, what are you doing in my building

68
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,170
跑来我公寓楼做什么
in the middle of the night?

69
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,720
我以为你不跟踪我了
I thought we were done with you following me.

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,760
我没跟踪你
I'm not following you.

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,470
我在等你
I'm waiting for you.

72
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,520
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

73
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,340
你需要  还是证监会
You need my help, or the SEC needs my help?

74
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,030
都需要
We both do.

75
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,510
但现在  我更在乎我自己
But at the moment, I care more about me

76
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,750
而不是证监会
than I do about the SEC.

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,100
我找不到那笔钱了
I can't find the money.

78
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,340
什么意思
What do you mean you can't find the money?

79
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,970
你这三个月都在做什么
What the hell have you been doing for the last three months?

80
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,750
找钱
Looking for the money.

81
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,800
那就再使劲点找
Then look harder,

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,960
伍德尔可不是做慈善的
because Woodall isn't in the charity business.

83
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,200
傅兹曼贿赂人
Forstman buys people,

84
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,220
我们把那人双手奉上了
and we handed them to you on a silver platter.

85
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,440
我为你冒了险
And I stuck my neck out for you,

86
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,180
指控我朋友受贿
and I accused my friend of being on the take.

87
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,970
如果我不能把事做到底
Now, if I can't follow through with that, 

88
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,830
埃里克·伍德尔就要逃脱罪责了
Eric Woodall walks.

89
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,060
查尔斯·傅兹曼也是
Charles Forstman walks.

90
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,540
你凭什么觉得  你都找不到那笔钱
Well, what makes you think I can find the money

91
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,360
我却能找到呢
when you couldn't?

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,580
我不知道你能不能
I don't know if you can or not,

93
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,260
但这个案子我只剩五天时间了
but they're gonna shut me down in five days,

94
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,820
能获得的帮助我都需要
and I need all the help I can get.

95
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,980
不说我了  说说你吧
Okay, enough about me. Let's talk about you.

96
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,110
这是我最喜欢的话题
Ooh, my favorite subject.

97
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,970
你知道我怎么想吗
You know what I think? 

98
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,590
我觉得你最喜欢的话题找上我
I think your favorite subject didn't come up to me

99
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,450
不是为了弄清楚我为什么上庭
just to find out why I went to trial.

100
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,630
你有所求
You want something.

101
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,200
是啊
I sure do.

102
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,100
我觉得我或许能给你
And I think I might be ready to give it to you.

103
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,160
不是性
It's not sex.

104
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,630
那当我没说
Then never mind.

105
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,650
你还真是坦诚啊
Wow, you're gonna be that honest about it.

106
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,910
省时间嘛
Saves time.

107
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,320
那我也不绕弯  我要做你的秘书
Well, in that case, I want to move to your desk.

108
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,000
为什么
And why is that?

109
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,660
因为人人知道  你再过几年
Because it's no secret that in a few years,

110
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,450
就要回高登·施密特·范·戴克律所
you're going back to Gordon, Schmidt, and Van Dyke.

111
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,790
我猜猜  你到时想一起来
And let me guess, you want to come with me when I do.

112
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,040
不
No, I don't.

113
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,480
那为什么
Then why?

114
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,500
因为我要做个演员
Because I'm gonna be an actress,

115
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,100
我想要一个知道
and I want somebody who understands

116
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,500
人生不止局限于地检官办公室的人
that there's more to life than just the DA's office.

117
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,710
而且我能付出一切
And that I can give my all to them

118
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,880
但偶尔还能去试镜
but still step out for the occasional audition.

119
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,270
你这就要抛弃我啊
So you're stepping out on me already?

120
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,150
是的  但重点是
Yes, but the important thing is,

121
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,010
我提前告诉你了啊
I'm telling you about it in advance.

122
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,400
麦卡伦36年
Macallan 36.

123
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,820
我没点这个啊
I didn't order a Macallan 36.

124
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,140
那边的先生送的
It's from the gentleman over there.

125
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,320
我不知道那人是谁
Okay, I don't know who that is,

126
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,080
但我现在就告诉你  他是麻烦
but I'm telling you right now, he is bad news.

127
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,080
你看上去很不一样
You look different.

128
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,360
我就当是夸我了
I will take that as a compliment.

129
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,510
我是说我没想到会见到你这样子...
I meant I wasn't expecting to see you like that--

130
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,760
我知道你什么意思
I-I know what you meant.

131
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,450
你的意思是  你根本没想到
What you really meant is that you weren't expecting

132
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,750
会看到我
to see me at all.

133
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,390
什么
Excuse me?

134
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,830
拜托  哈维
Come on, Harvey.

135
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,540
自从迈克回到律所
Ever since Mike came back to the firm,

136
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,610
你就一直视我不存在
I've basically been nonexistent to you.

137
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
怎么了
What's going on?

138
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,120
卡荷尔找不到那笔钱
Cahill can't find the money.

139
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,280
什么叫找不到那笔钱
What do you mean he can't find the money?

140
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,510
他这么长时间都在做什么啊
What's he been doing this whole time?

141
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,320
-我也这么问的  -那他怎么说
- Yeah, that's what I said. - And what did he say?

142
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,360
他说他遇到麻烦了  需要我们帮忙
He said he's in trouble and he needs our help.

143
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,150
我要告诉你一些不能告诉他的事
And I'm gonna tell you what I couldn't tell him.

144
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,320
他找不到钱
He can't find the money

145
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,380
是因为他找错了地方
because he's been looking in the wrong place.

146
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,630
那应该去哪里找
So where's the right place?

147
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,910
我也不太清楚
I don't know exactly.

148
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,570
但就在某处存在着一个埃里克·伍德尔在乎的人
But somewhere, there's a person Eric Woodall cares about,

149
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,900
那里就是钱的去处
and that's where the money went.

150
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,690
我们为什么不能跟卡荷尔这么说
And why can't we tell Cahill that?

151
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,490
因为我不想让他知道我是如何知道这件事的
Because I don't want him to know how I know it.

152
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,980
-那你是怎么知道的  -我就是知道
- How do you know it? - Because I know.

153
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,590
你想要个存在的机会
You want a chance to exist?

154
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,180
那就想出方法解决这件事
Figure out a way to get this done.

155
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,110
{\an8}我需要你  路易

156
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,430
路易  我收到你的便条了
Louis, I got your note,

157
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,350
我也知道诺玛还没回来
and I know that Norma's still out,

158
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,860
但我真的没时间...
but I really don't have time to--

159
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,700
诺玛死了
Norma's dead.

160
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,030
什么
What?

161
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,150
她今早照顾她姐姐时去世了
She died this morning taking care of her sister.

162
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,830
路易  我很遗憾
Oh, Louis, I'm so sorry.

163
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,210
不用装了  唐娜
You don't need to fake it, Donna.

164
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,860
我没有在装
I'm not faking it.

165
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,640
她是个不错的人
She was a sweet woman.

166
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,660
她就是个母老虎
She was a frickin' battle-ax is what she was.

167
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,560
过去的每一天
There wasn't a day that went by 

168
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,800
我都想把她曲张的静脉拽出来
that I didn't want to rip out

169
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,780
然后用它来勒死她
one of her varicose veins and strangle her with it.

170
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,070
好吧  我觉得你现在
Okay, I don't think you're in touch with 

171
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,280
无法认清自己的真实想法
how you're really feeling right now.

172
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,890
我现在的感觉就是她一如既往地
How I'm feeling is that she left me high and dry

173
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,170
留我在这里孤立无援
just like she always did.

174
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,920
你还想让她继续工作
You expect her to keep working?

175
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,020
看看这个
Look at this.

176
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,230
这是她全部的财产清单
It's her entire estate laid out on paper.

177
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,340
她没办法管理好我的日程
She couldn't manage my calendar,

178
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,560
自己的生活倒管得细致入微
but this crap that she plans within an inch of her life.

179
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,670
你希望我确保这些
And you want me to make sure

180
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,030
资产得到妥善安置吗
these things are bequeathed properly?

181
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,490
你把它们全拿去填充玩具我也没意见
You can stuff them in a giant pinata for all I care.

182
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,630
我还得去找个像样的罐子
I have to go find the perfect urn

183
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,300
装着她的骨灰从楼顶扔下去
to throw her ashes off the top of the building.

184
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,200
她这么要求的
She requested that?

185
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,670
没有  她想把骨灰放在我这里
No, she wanted them to be in here with me,

186
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,950
但我绝不会那么做的
but like hell I'm gonna do that.

187
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,790
好吧  路易  我帮你处理这件事
Okay, Louis, I will take care of this for you,

188
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,910
但你不能在我不在的时候去撒她的骨灰
but you're not throwing her ashes anywhere without me.

189
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:46,600
好吧
Okay, fine.

190
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,200
那你需要我去和哈维打个招呼吗
Do you want me to smooth things over with Harvey for you?

191
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,140
不用
No.

192
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,910
哈维现在自己靠自己就很好
Harvey will be just fine on his own.

193
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,450
我知道你是谁  我不感兴趣
I know who you are, and I'm not interested.

194
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,090
就因为我的名声不好吗
Just 'cause I got a bad reputation?

195
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,440
是我不想因为把你的对手关起来了
Because I'm not accepting a drink

196
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,160
就和你喝酒
for putting your rival behind bars.

197
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,580
你想错了  伙计
You got the wrong idea, pal.

198
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,870
我请你喝酒不是因为你把我的敌人关起来了
I didn't buy you that for putting my enemy away.

199
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,050
而是因为你把他关进去的方法
I bought you that for how you put my enemy away.

200
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,210
好吧  你得到我的注意了
Okay, you got me.

201
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,980
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

202
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,850
你
You.

203
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,670
你身上有些特别的东西
You've got something special.

204
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,050
我希望这样的人
And I want people with something special

205
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,040
为我工作
working for me.

206
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,970
我为什么会想要为你工作
Why exactly would I want to work for you?

207
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,250
我可以想到一百万个理由
I can think of a million reasons,

208
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,020
那正是我要给你的签约奖金
'cause that's the signing bonus I'm gonna give you,

209
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,560
那个数额也远超过
and that's a hell of a lot more money

210
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,930
你做一辈子律师能挣到的钱
than you're ever gonna make as a lawyer.

211
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,600
那我如果告诉你
And what if I told you

212
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,030
我当律师不是为了钱呢
I don't practice law to make money?

213
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,190
那我就会问你  你当律师是为了什么
Then I'd ask you, what do you practice it for?

214
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,280
为了让人们按我的意愿行事
To bend people to my will.

215
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,550
那就为我让别人按你的意愿行事
Then bend people to your will for me

216
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,760
除此之外再大赚一笔
and make a lot of money on top of it.

217
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,000
但傅滋曼先生  事情是这样的
Well, here's the thing, Mr. Forstman.

218
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,460
虽然这跟你没什么关系
Not that it's any of your business,

219
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,920
但我马上就可以每年挣五十万
but I'll be making 1/2 million a year in no time.

220
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,430
每年挣五十万算个屁
1/2 million a year is dick.

221
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,680
我的园丁都挣那么多
My gardener makes that.

222
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,990
那就把这工作给你园丁把
Then go offer your gardener a job,

223
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,180
因为我不感兴趣
because I'm not interested.

224
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,970
顺便说一句
Just so you know, 

225
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,060
如果你改变主意想来找我了
if you change your mind and come back to me,

226
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,980
那时候情况可就不一样了
it's not gonna be the same conversation.

227
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,150
谢谢你的酒  祝你好运  傅滋曼先生
Thanks for the drink. Good luck, Mr. Forstman.

228
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,080
你在干什么
What are you doing?

229
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,340
你觉得我在干什么
What do you think I'm doing?

230
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,000
如果傅滋曼把钱给了伍德尔亲近的人
If Forstman gave the money to someone Woodall's close to,

231
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,350
我们需要开始画家谱了
we need to start by compiling a family tree.

232
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,090
我是说你今天怎么不去上学
I meant why aren't you at school today?

233
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,840
因为我要向哈维证明我确实存在
Because I'm gonna prove to Harvey that I exist.

234
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,700
好吧
Okay.

235
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,620
既然你提起了  昨晚是怎么回事
Now that you mention it, what was that last night?

236
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,800
自从你回来
Ever since you came back,

237
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,320
就好像你和哈维在说着某种秘密语言
it's like you and Harvey speak this secret language,

238
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,210
而我却参与不进去
and I'm not a part of it.

239
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,660
瑞秋  别这样  我们有感情基础的
Rachel, come on. We have history.

240
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,750
我说的不是感情基础  我说的是尊重
I'm not talking about history. I'm talking about respect.

241
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,380
好吧  如果你认为哈维不尊重你
Okay, you don't know what you're talking about

242
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,930
那你一定是想错了
if you think Harvey doesn't respect you.

243
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,990
你是想跟我说昨晚
Are you gonna tell me that last night

244
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,930
他没有给你个表情暗示
he didn't give you a look that said,

245
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,560
"你不用全告诉她
"You don't need to tell her the full story

246
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,170
因为她没必要知道"
because she doesn't need to know"?

247
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,390
瑞秋  他用眼神示意
Rachel, he didn't give me that look

248
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,580
不是因为他不尊重你
because he doesn't respect you.

249
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,610
而是因为他觉得羞耻
He gave me that look because he's ashamed.

250
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,070
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

251
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,250
这么说吧  被查尔斯·傅滋曼耍过的
Let's just say that I'm not the only one

252
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,640
并不是只有我一个
that Charles Forstman duped.

253
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,030
-哈维也被傅滋曼摆过一道  -是的
- Harvey got taken by Forstman? - Yes.

254
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,880
他只告诉了我  因为他不得不说
And he only told me because he had to

255
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,750
那时收购战激战正酣
when we were in the middle of that takeover battle.

256
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,680
所以哈维才谁都不在乎
That's why Harvey's so slow to care about anybody.

257
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,660
傅滋曼利用了他在意的人
Forstman used somebody he cared about.

258
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,100
该死  我怎么没想到过
Holy shit. I never even thought about that.

259
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,630
你觉得会是谁
Who do you think it was?

260
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,800
我不知道  但我有个不错的猜想
I don't know, but I have a pretty good guess.

261
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,270
你觉得怎么样
Well, what do you think?

262
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,310
我觉得这地方很逊  而我很忙
I think this place is a dump, and I'm busy,

263
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,050
所以为什么不直说  叫我来干什么
so why don't you tell me why we're here?

264
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,090
我想在这开餐厅
I want to open a restaurant here.

265
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,190
马库斯  这里已经是一家餐厅了
Marcus, there's already a restaurant here.

266
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,520
而且买卖不好
And it isn't working.

267
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,390
所以他们租不下去了
Which is why they're gonna lose their lease.

268
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,040
看看这个
Take a look.

269
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,900
我已经找到了厨师
I've got a chef.

270
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,310
取得了酒类许可证
I've got a liquor license.

271
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,660
还有改造计划
I've got renovation plans.

272
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,920
我万事俱备
I have everything I need.

273
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,690
只差资金
Except the money.

274
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,880
我需要十五万美元
I need $150,000.

275
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,910
-你疯了  -拜托  哈维
- Are you crazy? - Come on, Harvey.

276
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,970
这是我的梦想
This is my dream.

277
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,540
我知道我能干好
I know I can make this work.

278
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,580
我不是说你不能
And I'm not saying you can't,

279
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,800
但我没有这笔钱
but I don't have that kind of money.

280
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,830
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

281
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,540
你是大牌律师
You're the big-time lawyer 

282
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,970
而且刚刚上了报纸
who just got his name in the paper.

283
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,720
上了报纸  也没人多给我钱
My name in the paper doesn't pay me extra money.

284
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,800
我每年收入是五万美元
I make $50,000 a year.

285
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,740
你说过你要当企业律师了
And you said you were gonna be a corporate lawyer.

286
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,930
是的  我当了之后可以帮助你  但现在...
Yeah, and when I am, I can help you, but right now...

287
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,430
我才不管你现在怎样
I don't give a shit about right now.

288
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,940
我只在乎你什么时候才能
I give a shit about when you were supposed to be

289
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,570
有个大哥的样子  可你呢  做了什么
my big brother, but instead, what did you do?

290
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,540
我知道我做了什么
I know what I did.

291
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,330
那你知道  我这辈子
Then you know I can never get a loan

292
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,590
都贷不到款吧
for as long as I live.

293
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,220
马库斯  你什么时候才能对自己
Marcus, when are you gonna take responsibility

294
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,980
负起责任呢
for your own shit?

295
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,570
你以为我这是在干什么
What the hell does it look like I'm trying to do?

296
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,660
我第一个来找你  是因为我知道你希望我成功
I came to you first because I know you'd want me to,

297
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,500
但如果你不想帮我
but if you don't come through,

298
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,100
我就去找妈妈
I'm gonna go to Mom.

299
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,610
你不是想找妈妈
You don't mean Mom.

300
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
是想找他
You mean him.

301
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,160
你一份钱也不许跟那个男人要
And you're not taking a nickel from that man.

302
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,750
拿他的钱  也不会
Taking his money isn't gonna make

303
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,070
让他对爸爸做出的事变得更糟
what he did to Dad any worse.

304
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,630
这是胡扯  你心知肚明
That's bullshit, and you know it,

305
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,000
我不会让你这么干的
and I'm not gonna let you do it.

306
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,250
哈维
Hey, Harvey.

307
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,340
你要怎么阻止我
How the hell are you gonna stop me?

308
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,190
是我疯了吗
Am I crazy,

309
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,870
还是你确实穿了
or is that the same dress you were wearing

310
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,100
上次见你时那条裙子
the last time I saw you?

311
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,350
肯定是你疯了
You must be crazy,

312
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,280
因为我从不穿同一件衣服
because I don't wear the same dress ever.

313
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,560
那你的衣橱肯定投入了巨资
Then you must spend a fortune on wardrobe.

314
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,910
但我必须说  这很值得
But I have to say, it's worth it.

315
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,100
我突然觉得  你不是顺路来拜访那么简单
I suddenly get the feeling this isn't just a drop-by.

316
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,220
我想加快速度
I want to move up our timeline.

317
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,620
哈维  我们说好的
Harvey, we have a deal.

318
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,470
我给你做担保
I put myself on the line for you,

319
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,590
而这个约定不能改
and our deal is not going to change.

320
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,630
我可以把钱还你  自己另谋高就
I could just pay you the money back and move on.

321
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,730
如果你能那么做  你就不会到这来
And if you could do that, you wouldn't be here

322
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,010
要求回来
asking to come back.

323
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,720
这次马库斯又输了多少钱
How much money did Marcus lose this time?

324
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,780
他没输钱  他想开一家餐厅
He didn't lose anything. He wants to start a restaurant.

325
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,430
他什么都不想开
He doesn't want to start shit.

326
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,110
他是又欠债了
He owes somebody something.

327
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,160
你不了解情况  他已经浪子回头了
You don't know that. He's turned his life around.

328
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,280
在我看来  他有问题
What I know is, he has a problem,

329
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,220
而且他想从你这里拿钱
and he's looking to get money from you.

330
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,720
而你不会从我这里拿到钱的
And you're not gonna get it from me.

331
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,400
那我就从别的地方弄
Then I'll get it somewhere else.

332
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,100
这话什么意思
And what's that supposed to mean?

333
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,120
查尔斯·傅滋曼要我去为他工作
I got a job offer from Charles Forstman.

334
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,260
看着我
Look at me.

335
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,890
我不管他向你许诺了什么
I don't care what he's offering you.

336
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,170
不要接受
Don't take it.

337
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,580
是因为他名声很差吗
Because he's got a bad reputation?

338
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,470
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know that?

339
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,290
我觉得你自以为知道很多事
I think there are a lot of things

340
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,900
但其实你并不了解
you think you know that you don't.

341
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,670
我只知道  要么你帮助我
What I know is, you're either gonna help me

342
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,160
要么查尔斯·傅滋曼帮我
or Charles Forstman is.

343
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,140
都取决于你
It's up to you.

344
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,750
哈维  我无法强迫你听我的
Harvey, I can't make you listen to me,

345
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,540
但我不会让你到这来
but what I'm not going to do is let you come here

346
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,160
用一个卑鄙的银行家
and leverage me with some bullshit offer

347
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,430
来威胁我给你些什么  所以随你便
from a shady banker, so do what you're gonna do.

348
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,700
别说我没有警告过你
But don't say I didn't warn you.

349
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,050
你要买多少"奇迹面包"都行  埃里克
You can buy all the Wonder Bread you want, Eric,

350
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,510
但你没法带进监狱
but you can't take it with you to prison.

351
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,580
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

352
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,920
我来提醒你一旦他们找到那笔钱
I'm here to remind you that once they find the money,

353
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,650
事情就全败露了
it's all gonna come tumbling down.

354
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,180
他们找不到的
Well, they're not gonna find the money,

355
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,390
因为根本没有那笔钱
'cause there is no money.

356
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,810
不在你的账户  卡荷尔不知道但我知道
Not in your accounts, but I know what Cahill doesn't.

357
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,300
傅滋曼把钱交给你在乎的人
Forstman gave it to somebody you care about,

358
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,110
等我告诉他  那一切就太晚了
and if I tell him that, it'll be too late.

359
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,370
我知道你想干什么
I know what you're trying to do.

360
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,090
你想引我把钱转走
You're trying to bait me into moving the body.

361
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,110
我们都知道你没那么傻
We both know you're not dumb enough to do that.

362
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,830
我是来给跟你做个交易
I'm here to get you to cut a deal

363
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,630
让你供出傅滋曼
and turn Forstman in.

364
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,090
你没资格跟我谈交易
You don't have the authority to cut a deal.

365
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,550
确实  但你雇我当你律师后
No, but I can get Cahill to

366
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,790
我可以让卡荷尔来谈交易
after you hire me to represent you.

367
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,210
你说雇只狐狸来看鸡舍
You mean hire the fox to watch the henhouse?

368
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,540
门都没有
Not a chance.

369
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,910
埃里克  他们就要查到你了
Eric, they're closing in,

370
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,670
一旦查到  你就需要找我了
and when they do, you're gonna want to call me.

371
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,430
不如你先收下我的名片
So why don't you take my card?

372
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,790
太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

373
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,920
伍德尔找到30个值得怀疑的人
Woodall's got 30 people it could be,

374
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,050
但也可能根本不在这30人里
or it could be none of them.

375
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,660
我知道  但这是我们的任务
I know that, but this is our job.

376
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,840
不  我们的任务是帮哈维打败傅滋曼
No, our job is to help Harvey get Forstman.

377
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,860
如果你确实在想我觉得你在想的事
If you're thinking what I think you're thinking--

378
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,740
-是的  -瑞秋  我们不可能让哈维
- I am, and you are too. - Rachel, we are never gonna get Harvey

379
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,100
去为12年前的事对付傅滋曼
to go after Forstman for what they did 12 years ago.

380
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,800
为什么  因为他弟弟吗
Why, because of his brother?

381
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,410
对  因为他弟弟  也可能因为他惭愧
Yes, because of his brother, or because he's ashamed.

382
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,260
不管怎么说  他知道有种可能性
Either way, he knows it's a possibility.

383
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,150
他用不着我去告诉他
He doesn't need me to tell him about it.

384
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,760
不  他只是不需要我去告诉他
No, he just doesn't need me to tell him about it.

385
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,700
-瑞秋  -跟我存不存在无关
- Rachel-- - This is not about that.

386
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,070
我不能跟他说
Look, I can't tell him

387
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,290
因为我不该知道这件事  但你可以
because I'm not supposed to know, but you can.

388
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,270
我说了他不想听这种话
And I just told you, he doesn't want to hear it.

389
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,600
他的意愿阻止过你开口骂
And when has that ever stopped you before?

390
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,260
-这不一样  -为什么
- This is different. - Why?

391
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,850
因为他为此惭愧
Because he's ashamed.

392
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,250
那他现在就没有正确看待问题
Then he's not thinking right,

393
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,160
他比任何时候都需要你
and he needs your help more than ever.

394
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,010
那我们一起跟他说
Then we're both telling him.

395
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,040
迈克  我不需要那份功劳
Mike, I don't need the credit.

396
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,350
不  这无关功劳  这与我们有关
No, this isn't about credit. This is about us.

397
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,400
他不能指望我会对你有所隐瞒
He can't tell me something and expect me not to tell you.

398
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,070
你想见我
You wanted to see me?

399
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,840
没错  你这一整天去哪儿了
Yes. Where have you been all day?

400
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,590
怎么了  你有事要跟我说吗
Why? Is there something you want to talk about?

401
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,620
对啊  你去哪里了
Yeah, where you've been.

402
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,490
肖恩·卡荷尔昨晚到我门口
Sean Cahill was at my door last night--

403
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,730
哈维  诺玛去世了
Harvey, Norma passed away.

404
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,140
我在帮路易的忙
I've been helping Louis.

405
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,470
诺玛死了
Norma died?

406
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,650
真糟糕
That's terrible.

407
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,680
我还以为你受不了她呢
I thought you couldn't stand her.

408
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,060
我是受不了  但我认为路易爱她...
I couldn't, but I assume Louis loved her, so...

409
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,180
该干什么干什么去吧
Do what you need to do. 

410
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,980
因为她是他的秘书  所以他肯定爱她
Because she was his secretary, he must have loved her.

411
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,270
-我不是这意思  -但你就是这么说的
- That's not what I meant. - But it is what you said.

412
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,280
好吧  唐娜  怎么了
Okay, Donna. What's wrong?

413
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,790
那我们先来谈谈这个吧
How about we start with the fact

414
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,780
过去的十个小时里我都在想
that I have been wondering for the last ten hours

415
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,270
你会不会承认昨晚发生的事
if you're going to acknowledge what happened last night.

416
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,270
但你还是这样  所以你肯定不会承认了
But you're you, so of course you're not.

417
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,370
我不会承认什么
I'm not gonna acknowledge it

418
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,690
因为昨晚什么都没发生
because nothing happened last night.

419
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,690
为什么  别说我知道
Why? And don't tell me I know why.

420
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,470
因为你知道那是个错误
Because it would have been a mistake, and you know it.

421
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,040
我知道的是昨晚有事发生了
What I know is something happened,

422
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,940
但在你告诉我你爱我之后就跑掉了
and you ran away, but not before you told me you loved me.

423
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,280
我之所以那么说是为了让你好受点
I did that because I wanted to make you feel better.

424
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,420
你刚才说了什么
What did you just say to me?

425
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,070
我不是这个意思  我不是说...
That's not what I meant. I didn't say that--

426
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,730
因为你可怜我  你说了
Because you pity me? Yeah, you did.

427
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,650
不是  我那么说是因为我爱你
No, I said it because I love you,

428
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,690
我希望你知道
and I wanted you to know it.

429
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,900
怎么爱我了
Love me how?

430
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,610
-为什么非得...  -怎么爱我了
- Why does that have to-- - Love me how?

431
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,580
跟我想的一样
That's what I thought.

432
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,020
你要么无法回答要么不想回答
You either can't answer or you won't,

433
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,930
简直胡扯  因为显然
which is bullshit, because obviously,

434
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,550
你根本不是那么看我的
you don't just look at me this way.

435
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,440
你可以那么看待我
You're capable of looking at me that way,

436
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,970
但你不想让世界崩溃
but you don't want to let those worlds collide

437
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,650
因为你害怕失去一切
because you're afraid to risk anything.

438
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,860
因为我们拥有一切
Because we have everything.

439
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,800
不  哈维  是你拥有一切
No, Harvey. You have everything.

440
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,570
那你想要拥有一切吗
So you're saying you want everything?

441
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,280
我不知道  哈维
I don't know, Harvey,

442
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,920
但我知道  我不需要你的怜悯
but what I do know is I don't want your pity.

443
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,230
你在这里做什么  没人知道我住这里
What are you doing here? Nobody finds out where I live.

444
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,350
我知道
I do.

445
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,730
稍等  我把这个关掉
Hold on a second. Let me turn this off.

446
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,730
你开玩笑吧  你在看《华尔街》
You got to be kidding me. You're watching Wall Street?

447
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,730
{\an8}《华尔街》为1987年奥利弗·斯通导演的电影

448
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,930
每月一次提醒自己
A monthly ritual to remind myself.

449
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,970
提醒什么
Of what?

450
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,450
戈登.盖可有多娘炮
Of what a pussy Gordon Gekko is.

451
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,450
{\an8}戈登·盖可为电影《华尔街》中臭名昭著的金融家

452
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,000
说说你怎么改变主意了吧
Now, you want to tell me what changed your mind?

453
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,050
我认为我还是需要钱
I decided I wanted the money.

454
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,150
你拒绝过我
And you turned me down,

455
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,250
现在你得告诉我为什么需要钱
so now you're gonna tell me why you want the money.

456
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,700
我弟弟需要十五万开餐馆
My brother needs $150,000 for a restaurant.

457
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,980
现在有的谈了
Now we're getting somewhere.

458
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,800
-说吧  -好吧  你想听吗
- Let's have it. - Okay, you want it?

459
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,450
是这样的
Here it is.

460
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,970
这不只是个餐馆  还是个洗心革面的机会
It's not just a restaurant. It's a second chance.

461
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,490
马库斯赌博成瘾
Marcus has a gambling problem,

462
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,450
是我害他染上的
and I gave it to him.

463
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,970
你觉得这是他重新做人的机会
And you think this is his way out?

464
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,240
这确实是
I know it is.

465
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,450
咱俩不怎么对路呀
We're not a good fit,

466
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,400
餐馆经常倒闭
'cause restaurants fail,

467
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,830
一旦他的餐馆倒闭  你就会离开
and when this one does, you'll leave.

468
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,940
所以你还是现在就离开的好
So you might as well leave right now.

469
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,510
不如我们赌一把
Then how about we bet on it?

470
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,600
你要靠赌博
You're gonna gamble on something

471
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,950
帮你弟弟摆脱赌瘾吗
to get your brother out of a gambling problem?

472
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,900
-我又没说我有赌瘾  -说不定你有呢
- I didn't say I had a problem. - I think maybe you do.

473
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,210
如果总赢不输  这就不是问题了
When you always win, it's not a problem.

474
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,840
我觉得我会喜欢你的  伙计
I think I might like you, pal.

475
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,830
路易
Louis.

476
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,100
我收到你的短信  怎么了
I got your message. What's going on?

477
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,540
怎么了  他们想糊弄我
What's going on is, they're trying to screw me,

478
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,820
我要你来唱白脸
and I need you to be bad cop.

479
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,730
什么
What?

480
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,310
您选好了吗  先生
Have you made a decision, sir?

481
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,380
没有  没选好  你个赚死人钱的奸商
No, I haven't made a decision, you shyster dealer of death.

482
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,690
我想我们还需要点时间
Okay, I think maybe we're gonna need another minute.

483
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,020
不  不需要
No, we don't.

484
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,100
我才不需要再选
I don't need another minute to see

485
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,920
这个跟家得宝的水壶似的
that this looks like a pot from Home Depot,

486
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,760
这个像是六号汽车旅馆的台灯
this looks like a lamp from Motel 6,

487
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,700
这个像见鬼的榴弹炮
and this looks like a goddamn howitzer shell.

488
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,900
你真幸运
You are lucky that I don't 

489
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,000
我没把这破罐子
take this mockery of a final resting place

490
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,160
买下来塞你屁眼里
and shove it up your ass.

491
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,050
-路易  够了  -不够
- Louis, that's enough. - No, it's not enough.

492
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,080
我为这破事折腾两天了
I've been handling this bullshit for two days

493
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,130
还是为了那个本应该来帮我做事的女人
for a woman who's supposed to be handling things for me.

494
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,490
路易  你发脾气不是因为骨灰瓮
Louis, this isn't about the urn.

495
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,240
少跟我煽情
Oh, please don't give me that touchy-feely shit.

496
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,880
你为什么不给我唱白脸
And why the hell are you not being bad cop?

497
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,920
因为现在需要的不是这个
Because that's not what's needed.

498
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,830
去他的不是这个
Oh, bullshit it's not what's needed.

499
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,310
-路易  -你一点不关心我
- Louis. - You don't care about me.

500
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,860
你从来不关心我
You never cared about me.

501
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,630
你只关心你自己
All you care about is yourself...

502
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,250
还有你那个蠢姐姐  和你的赫梅尔陶俑
and your stupid sister and your Hummel figurines

503
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,750
还有你的《女作家与谋杀案》重播
and your Murder, She Wrote reruns.

504
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,350
路易  我不是诺玛
Louis, I'm not Norma.

505
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,840
她走了
She's gone...

506
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,200
一切会好起来的
and it's gonna be okay.

507
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,810
她就是个母老虎
She was a battle-ax!

508
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,790
可她是我的母老虎
But she was my battle-ax.

509
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,200
我知道
I know.

510
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,840
她不只是让我孤立无援
Oh, she didn't just leave me high and dry.

511
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,530
还永远离开了我
She left me for good.

512
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,180
我好伤心
I'm so sorry.

513
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,690
没事了
It's okay.

514
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,860
怎么两个一起来了
Both of you?

515
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,910
我俩都为你工作
We both work for you.

516
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,130
所以我们一起来跟你说
Which is why we're both here to say

517
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,720
也许是时候换个调查方向
maybe it's time we explore other options.

518
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,710
你在开玩笑吧
You got to be kidding me.

519
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,770
你在这上面花了两天
You spent two days on this,

520
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,960
就打算缴械投降了吗
and you're ready to throw in the towel?

521
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,640
我们花了五天中的两天来调查
We've spent two of our five days on it,

522
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,780
依旧一无所获
and we still don't have a name,

523
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,920
-所以我们觉得是时候考虑...  -什么
- so we think it's time to consider-- - What?

524
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,940
追究傅滋曼
Going after Forstman

525
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,840
十二年前对你做的事
for whatever he did to you 12 years ago.

526
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,030
-你告诉她了  -是的
- You told her? - Yes, I did.

527
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,050
正如我刚才所说  我俩都为你工作
Because like I said, we both work for you.

528
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,110
也就是说我俩都想帮忙
Which means we both want to help.

529
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,250
你们以为过去十几年
You think I haven't wondered how to go after Forstman

530
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,960
我就没想过怎么对付傅滋曼吗
100 times in the last dozen years?

531
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,770
那为什么不动手
Then why don't you?

532
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,380
因为有危险的不只我一个
Because I'm not the only one at risk.

533
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,560
你是说你弟弟
You mean your brother.

534
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,580
对
Yes, I do.

535
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,980
我不会把他牵扯进来
And I'm not gonna bring him into this,

536
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,550
因为他什么都没做错
because he didn't do anything wrong.

537
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,970
哈维  我不是说...
Harvey, I'm not saying--

538
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,210
你没听到吗
Did you hear me?

539
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,820
他不只有我的把柄
He doesn't just have a gun to my head, okay?

540
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,740
还有我弟弟的
He's got one to my brother's.

541
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,930
你告诉过我多少遍
And how many times have you told me

542
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,350
当别人有你的把柄
that when someone has a gun to your head,

543
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,560
就换个方式解决问题
you figure a different way out?

544
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,620
这可是查尔斯·傅滋曼
This is Charles Forstman.

545
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,250
-没别的办法  -哈维  有...
- There is no other way out. - Harvey, there's--

546
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,980
我把活儿派给你了  你去做事就行
I gave you a job to do. Now do your goddamn job.

547
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,010
撞墙了吧
Well, that was a bust.

548
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,340
-总要试试  -是吗
- We had to try. - Did we?

549
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,710
我就说他会生气  他果然生气了
I told you he'd be pissed off, and he was.

550
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,400
你还说他得听听
Yeah, and you also told me he needed to hear things

551
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,310
不想听的事
that he didn't want to hear.

552
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,560
好吧  现在他只听到
Okay, well, now all he heard is,

553
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,420
他自己不光不能信任我  你也不可信任
not only can't he trust me, he can't trust you either.

554
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,340
不是这样  你知道的
That's not what he heard, and you know it.

555
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,140
他听到的是  你是我在这个世界上
What he heard was that you're the closest person

556
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,960
最亲近的人
in the world to me,

557
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,510
我永远不会瞒着你
I am never gonna keep things from you,

558
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,360
为他干活的也不只我一个
and I'm not the only one in his corner.

559
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,760
我是你在这个世界上最亲近的人
I'm the closest person in the world to you.

560
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,010
当然了  你怎么可以...
Of course you are. How can you even--

561
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,810
我不是在质疑这个
I'm not questioning it.

562
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,390
我是你在这个世界上最亲近的人
I'm the closest person in the world to you,

563
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,340
而我不会上你的族谱
and I wouldn't be on your family tree.

564
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,430
-你是说伍德尔  -没错  我是在说伍德尔
- You're talking about Woodall. - Yes, I'm talking about Woodall.

565
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,360
伍德尔结婚了
Woodall's married.

566
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,510
我们查了他的妻子  什么也没发现
We checked his wife. Nothing.

567
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,070
这就是关键  我们没结婚
That's the thing. We're not married.

568
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,780
好吧  我真的不觉得现在是时候提这个
Okay, I really don't think this is the time to bring that up.

569
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,440
我是认真的
I'm being serious.

570
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,550
我们彻查了每个和他有关系的人
We've exhausted every person that's related to him.

571
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,770
也许是时候查查和他没关系的人了
Maybe it's time we found someone who isn't.

572
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,190
-太天才了  -谢谢
- That's genius. - Thank you.

573
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,890
现在我是真不明白为何哈维不尊重你了
Now I really don't understand why Harvey doesn't respect you.

574
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,730
说早了
It's too soon.

575
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,550
这个玩笑开早了
It's too soon for that joke.

576
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,830
早了
Too soon.

577
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,180
我可以随便选吗
I can have any one?

578
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,400
随便选
Take your pick.

579
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,580
没关系  反正你都会输
It doesn't matter, 'cause you're gonna lose.

580
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,560
真是有趣了
That's funny.

581
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,520
我倒觉得我会赢两次呢
I look at it like I'm gonna win twice.

582
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,850
我要开辆很叼的车  狠狠赢你一把
I get to drive a badass car, and I get to kick your ass.

583
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,620
自大  我喜欢
Cocky. I like that.

584
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,670
像你这种人  我很惊讶你居然可以忍受
A guy like you, I'm surprised you could stand working

585
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,740
替卡梅隆·丹尼斯工作
for Cameron Dennis in the first place.

586
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,770
-什么意思  -他不喜欢自大的人
- What do you mean? - He doesn't like cocky.

587
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,800
就拿那谁  什么名字来着...杜彭
Take, for instance, what's-his-name--DuPont?

588
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,580
他是怎么回事  偷税漏税吗
What's he up for? Tax evasion?

589
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,150
-内幕交易  -是的  随便啦
- Insider trading. - Yeah, whatever.

590
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,120
重点是  在你那天立功了之后
The point is, after what you did the other day,

591
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,200
为什么不是你主导那个案子
why aren't you leading that?

592
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,670
因为这是卡梅隆的案子
Because this is Cameron's case.

593
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,220
假如我是他的话  案子就是你的了
If I were him, it'd be yours.

594
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,200
哈维  你是他的明星选手
Harvey, you are his star player,

595
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
而他却连场都不让你上
and he's not even putting you in the game.

596
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,210
更重要的是
And on top of that,

597
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,530
他没胆量宣告他到底要不要查杜彭
he didn't have the balls to announce whether he's going after DuPont or not.

598
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,060
你就不操心卡梅隆·丹尼斯了
Don't you worry about Cameron Dennis.

599
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,010
杜彭会罪有应得的
DuPont's gonna get what's coming to him.

600
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,080
我就是想听这句话
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

601
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,720
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

602
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,260
你忠于你的雇主
Well, you're loyal to the guy you work for.

603
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,440
我喜欢
I like that.

604
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,740
所以你刚刚就说他坏话
So you were just talking shit about him

605
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,400
看看我会不会上钩吗
to see if I'd jump on board?

606
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,770
而你没上钩...
And you didn't...

607
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,160
因此我们也没必要赛车了
which is why we don't have to race anymore.

608
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,250
你是说我得到了这份工作吗
You're saying I got the job?

609
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,020
欢迎加入
I'm saying welcome to the team.

610
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,690
这一切都很棒  查尔斯
Well, that's all well and good, Charles,

611
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,750
但我们还是要赛一场
but we're still racing.

612
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,050
当然要赛
We sure as hell are.

613
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,250
只不过需要另寻一个赌注了
We just have to find something else to bet on.

614
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,420
你好啊  肖恩  见到你真高兴
Hey, Sean. Good to see you.

615
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,620
别给我来这套
Don't give me that shit.

616
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,640
你昨天早上在埃里克·伍德尔逛超市时
Did you confront Eric Woodall yesterday morning

617
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,740
去找他了吗
at his supermarket?

618
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,300
我们偶然碰上了
I ran into him by accident.

619
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,730
我喜欢那家超市的农产品
I like the produce there.

620
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,000
我现在没心情开玩笑  哈维
I'm not in the mood, Harvey.

621
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,100
你是接近了证监会调查中的涉案人员
Did you approach the subject of an SEC investigation

622
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,300
并且恐吓他了吗
with the express purpose of intimidating him?

623
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,880
我接近他是为了
I approached him with the express purpose

624
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,210
让他雇我做他的律师
of hiring me as his lawyer.

625
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,120
你为什么要干那种事
Why the hell would you do that?

626
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,370
你应该是来帮我的
You're supposed to be helping me.

627
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,450
假如他愿意承认自己做了什么
And if he's willing to admit what he did,

628
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,300
那就帮到你了
that is helping you.

629
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,260
相反  他声称我派你去那里恐吓他
And instead, he's claiming that I sent you there to intimidate him.

630
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,400
我猜这就是突破的方式
Then I guess that's the way it's breaking.

631
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,520
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

632
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,190
他要么选择买我的帐
He's either gonna buy what I'm selling

633
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,500
要么掩饰自己留下的痕迹
or cover his tracks.

634
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,350
假如他要掩饰痕迹  你得去抓他现行
And if he covers his tracks, you need to be there.

635
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,060
你是请求我跟踪他吗
Are you asking me to follow him?

636
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,970
不  我是要求你要跟踪他
No, I'm telling you to follow him.

637
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,900
我不能那样做  我没有权限
I can't do that. I don't have authorization.

638
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,900
那你还跟踪我
Didn't stop you following me.

639
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,050
够了
Enough.

640
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,280
他要控告我骚扰
He's filing charges of harassment against me.

641
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,270
我们这样做根本没用
We do this, nothing sticks.

642
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,340
那也许我们没办法抓到他了
Then we might not get him,

643
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,410
因为我手上什么也没有
because I have nothing.

644
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,040
让我给你一点额外的动力
Well, let me give you a little extra motivation.

645
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,870
记住  伍德尔知道一切关于路易·利特的
Remember, Woodall knows all about

646
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,330
那点和傅滋曼有关的小罪行
Louis Litt's little Forstman transgression.

647
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,410
所以假如他被证明无罪
So if he gets exonerated,

648
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,760
你觉得他第一个会找谁报仇
who do you think's gonna be the first person he goes after?

649
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,720
所以  与其去新泽西买你的农产品
So, instead of going to Jersey for your produce,

650
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,400
还不如弄点我能用得上的东西
go get me something I can use.

651
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,360
怎么在一个人喝闷酒
You're having a drink by yourself?

652
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,650
发生什么事情了
What's going on?

653
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,420
发生的事情是
What's going on is,

654
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,640
我刚刚让人把杰夫的名字从他门上刮下来了
I just finished having them scrape Jeff's name off his door.

655
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,600
你不说说你为什么在这里吗  哈维
So why don't you tell me why you're here, Harvey?

656
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,290
卡荷尔找不到证据
Cahill's having trouble getting evidence

657
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,800
指控傅滋曼和伍德尔
against Forstman and Woodall.

658
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,870
我知道
I'm aware of that.

659
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,200
那你也应该知道
Then you should also be aware that

660
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,270
假如伍德尔保住了他的工作
if Woodall keeps his job,

661
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,590
就会去找路易的麻烦
he's likely to go after Louis.

662
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,400
我能想明白那点  你也可以
I could've done that math, and so could you,

663
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,370
所以...
so...

664
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,170
我也许可以帮他们抓到傅滋曼...
I might be able to help them get Forstman...

665
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,570
通过别的事情
on something else.

666
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,020
这和他12年前
Does this have something to do

667
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,540
给你那份工作的事有关系吗
with when he offered you that job 12 years ago?

668
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,870
有关
Yes.

669
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,600
我说了那人是个大麻烦
I told you that man was trouble.

670
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,850
我也说了我不会放弃马库斯
And I told you I wouldn't abandon Marcus

671
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,530
而且你看错他了
and you were wrong about him.

672
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,020
所以这事还和马库斯有关
So this has something to do with Marcus.

673
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,320
是的
Yes, it does.

674
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,430
如果你是想让我在
Well, if you are asking me to choose

675
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,770
你弟弟和路易之间做选择  你知道结果
between your brother and Louis, you know who I'm choosing.

676
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,060
我没让你做选择
I'm not asking you to do that.

677
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,880
那你想让我干什么
Then what are you asking?

678
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,040
我想让你帮我整理思路
I want your help to get my mind right.

679
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,560
问题在于  哈维
Here's the thing, Harvey.

680
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,900
杰夫走了
Jeff's gone,

681
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,670
而他离开是我做的选择导致的
and he's gone because of the choices I made.

682
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,120
所以我不知道我能否为你整理思路
So I'm not sure if I can help you get your mind right,

683
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,340
因为眼下
'cause right now...

684
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,800
我的也是一团糟
mine's not right.

685
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,590
失陪一下
Hang on a sec.

686
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,160
你来这儿不只是为了通知我上班时间吧
You didn't come down here just to give me my start date.

687
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,260
我来是为了告诉你
I came down here to tell you

688
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,770
我觉得你很特别
I think you have something special,

689
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,950
我也很愿意让你为我工作
and I'd love nothing more than to have you on my desk,

690
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,640
但我就要辞去检察官的职位了
but I'm leaving the DA's office.

691
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,940
这和那天请你喝酒的那个
Does this have something to do with that Forstman guy

692
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,630
傅滋曼有关吗
buying you a drink the other night?

693
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,350
你不是不认识他吗
I thought you didn't know who he was.

694
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,630
我查了查他的底细
Well, I looked him up

695
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,890
因为我以为以后要为你工作了
because I thought I was gonna be working for you.

696
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,310
而且我告诉你  他很坏
And I'm telling you, he's shady.

697
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,090
就因为他名声不好吗
Because he's got a bad reputation?

698
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,010
我才不在乎他的名声
I don't care what his reputation is.

699
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,730
你还不了解我  我很会看人
You don't know this about me yet, but I know people...

700
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,250
我对他们的了解有时比他们自己还透彻
usually better than they know themselves.

701
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,310
所以我知道你是个好人
And the same way I know you are a good person,

702
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,620
我还可以告诉你那个人可坏到家了
I can tell you that man is rotten to the core.

703
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,840
你只是为了说服我
You're just trying to get me to stay

704
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,260
让你做我的秘书
so you can work at my desk.

705
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,390
听着
Listen to me.

706
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,030
我不在乎你要不要雇我
I don't care whether I work on your desk or not.

707
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,120
为那个人干活绝对是个大错误
You're making a mistake if you take a job with that man.

708
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,460
那恐怕我在犯大错误了
Then I guess I'm making a mistake,

709
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,740
因为我已经接受了他的邀请
because I already did.

710
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,960
认识你很高兴  唐娜
It was nice knowing you, Donna.

711
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,940
所以你最终还是决定留下她了
So you're keeping her here after all.

712
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,300
在你把我弄哭后  我也没办法
Yeah, I couldn't throw her off the roof

713
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,800
把她从屋顶撒下去了
after you got me to cry.

714
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,990
太好了
I'm glad.

715
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,730
唐娜  我都不知道该怎么感谢你
Donna, I can't thank you enough for what you did.

716
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,790
不用客气  路易
Oh, you're welcome, Louis.

717
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,220
事实是  这让我也好了很多
The truth is, I needed this more than you know.

718
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,730
我理解
Well, I get it.

719
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,180
你需要分分神
You needed a distraction

720
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,870
因为刚刚过去的这些麻烦事
after everything you just went through.

721
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,400
是啊  算是吧
Uh, yeah. Something like that.

722
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,620
老实说
Truth is,

723
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,890
我自己也需要分分神
I could use a distraction myself.

724
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,400
还有件事你需要做
Well, there is one thing that you still need to do.

725
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,220
你得开始想着找新秘书了
You need to start thinking about a new secretary.

726
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,290
唐娜  我知道我之前问过你
Donna, I know I've asked you this before,

727
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,220
但现在我们的关系比当时近多了  而且
but we're so much closer now than we were then, and--

728
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,740
路易  我为哈维工作
Louis, I work for Harvey.

729
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,720
你知道我不能当你的秘书
You know I can't be your secretary.

730
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,690
但我们心意相通啊
But we have this bond...

731
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,030
你和我
you and I.

732
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,990
我们都喜欢莎士比亚  喜欢射击俱乐部
Shakespeare, the gun club.

733
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,080
我们一向有共同语言  你自己也知道的
We've always spoken the same language, and you know it.

734
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,050
路易  我不能这么做
Louis, I can't.

735
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,350
我理解
I get it.

736
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,090
我们还是当朋友更好些
We're better as friends.

737
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,770
不如我为诺玛办场小型告别会吧
How about I set up a little farewell for Norma

738
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,080
作为你临时秘书的最后一项工作
as my last official act as your interim secretary?

739
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,580
谢谢你  唐娜
Thank you, Donna.

740
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,370
你确定地址没错吗
Are you sure we've got the right address?

741
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,680
确定
I'm positive.

742
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,330
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

743
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,250
有什么能帮您的吗
Can I help you?

744
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,180
我们想找玛丽·安·玛葛拉
Uh, yes, is there a Mary Ann McGrath here?

745
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,250
请问您是哪位
Who can I say is asking?

746
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,480
我们来自皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特
We're with Pearson Specter Litt.

747
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,900
我们想就一桩调查中的案子和她谈谈
We'd like to speak with her in regards to an ongoing case.

748
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,380
我想这恐怕不行
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

749
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,800
你刚说她在的  我不明白
You just said she was here. I don't understand--

750
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,140
玛丽·安得了老年痴呆症
Mary Ann has advanced Alzheimer's.

751
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,930
但她才55岁
But she's 55.

752
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,970
是早发性的  而且她的症状尤其严重
It's early onset, and hers is particularly aggressive.

753
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,770
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

754
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,230
能告诉我们她患病多久了吗
Can I ask how long she's been a patient?

755
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,240
我们不能透露病人信息
We're not supposed to disclose any--

756
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,120
拜托  这事很重要
Please. It's really important.

757
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,690
她是一年半左右前被转来这里的
She was moved her about a year and a half ago.

758
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,840
那之前呢
And before that?

759
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,230
我不太清楚
I don't really know,

760
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,840
但我想之前她受到的治疗不怎么好
but I don't think she was getting the best care.

761
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,750
谢谢
Thank you.

762
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,580
我妈妈才55岁
My mother's 55.

763
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,720
如果她能来这里是因为傅滋曼的资助
You know, and if she's only here because Forstman pays for it--

764
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,600
我知道
I know.

765
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
哈维要我们找到
Harvey wants us to find

766
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,130
伍德尔亲近的人
the person Woodall's close to.

767
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,080
我们也只能做到这一步
That's all we can do.

768
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,030
我们能做到这一步
Well, "All we can do"

769
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,100
意味着再送她回一个条件很差的医院
is gonna send her back to some horrible facility.

770
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,840
-那也不一定  -肯定的
- We don't exactly know that. - Yes, we do.

771
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,040
瑞秋  这确实很糟糕
Rachel, it's terrible.

772
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,170
我跟你一样不喜欢这样
I don't like it any more than you do,

773
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,760
但这不取决于我们
but it's not up to us.

774
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,540
我知道
I know.

775
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,600
只是这糟透了
It just sucks.

776
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,030
你个该死的骗子
You goddamn liar.

777
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,300
别生气
Oh, don't be mad.

778
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,760
没错  肯奇塔告诉大家我不在家
Yeah, Conchita tells everybody I'm not home.

779
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,390
你知道我在说什么
You know what I'm talking about.

780
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,630
杜彭投资今天跌停了
DuPont Investments dropped through the floor today,

781
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,550
而你抛空了
and you sold short

782
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,060
根据我私下告诉你的信息
based on something that I told you in confidence.

783
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,560
我不记得你告诉过我什么
I don't recall you telling me anything at all.

784
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,670
你个婊子养的
You son of a bitch.

785
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,730
这次交易你赚了1亿多美元
You made over $100 million on that trade.

786
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,060
是啊  没错
Yeah, I did.

787
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,790
欢迎来到现实世界  伙计
Welcome to the real world, pal.

788
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,460
我的现实世界里可不会跟年轻检察官交友
My real world doesn't involve befriending young attorneys

789
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,050
以获得内幕信息
to get inside information.

790
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,380
也许你跟我真的合不来
Maybe you're not the right man for me after all.

791
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,040
你觉得发生了这些事我还想为你工作吗
You think I still want to work for you after this?

792
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,950
你想要赢得竞争和钱
You wanted competition and money.

793
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,800
你赢得了竞争
You got the competition.

794
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,530
这里还有你的钱
Here's your money.

795
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,300
你自己留着那100万吧
You can shove that $1 million up your ass,

796
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,640
因为我不仅不会接受你的工作
because I'm not only not taking your job,

797
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,870
我还要起诉你
I'm gonna prosecute you.

798
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,270
那你在起诉书里也得写上你的名字
Then you might as well add your name to the indictment

799
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,100
既然你已经跟我共享收益
since you've already shared in the profits.

800
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,590
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

801
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,160
看看这张支票吧
Take a look at this check.

802
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,830
不是100万
It's not $1 million.

803
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,740
是85万
It's 850,000.

804
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,190
我猜你知道另外15万上哪儿去了
Bet you can guess where the other $150,000 went.

805
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,690
你干了什么
What did you do?

806
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,290
你知道我干了什么
You know what I did.

807
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,130
马库斯跟这事毫无关系
Marcus had nothing to do with this.

808
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,270
如果你马上答应了  他确实是没关系
He wouldn't have had you said yes right away.

809
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,480
但你没有
But you didn't.

810
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,190
我们会把钱还给你
We're giving you the money back.

811
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,090
你会伤透了他的心的
You're gonna break his little heart.

812
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,270
他以为这钱是你给的
He thinks that money came from you.

813
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,610
你从赌徒手里把钱抢走
And you snatch cash out of an addicted gambler's hands,

814
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,120
夺走他的梦想
take away his dream,

815
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,080
那这个故事只有一个结局
only one way that story ends.

816
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,010
所以你要么继续生气
So you can either pout about it...

817
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,110
要么接受现实  然后向大家证明
or you can embrace it and prove to everyone I was right

818
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,600
我说你有特别之处  是对的
when I said I saw something special in you.

819
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,850
风水轮流转  查尔斯
Someday the shoe's gonna be on the other foot, Charles.

820
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,970
我见过的每个输家都这么说
Words spoken by every loser I've ever met.

821
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,610
回见  伙计
See you around, pal.

822
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,210
是伍德尔的发妻
It's Woodall's first wife.

823
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,480
她名叫玛丽·安  他们一起长大
Her name's Mary Ann. They grew up together.

824
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,680
21岁时结婚
They got married when they were 21

825
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,530
6个月后离婚
and had it annulled six months later.

826
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,930
那笔钱是做什么用的
And what's the money for?

827
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,300
-她得了老年痴呆症  -别告诉我
- She has Alzheimer's. - Don't tell me.

828
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,760
他让她住进高级疗养院
He moved her to a high-end facility

829
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,050
支付24小时监护费
and pays for round-the-clock care.

830
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,640
问题是  我们给处理账单的
And the problem is, we called the company

831
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,540
公司打了电话  然后
that handles the billing, and--

832
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,310
全用现金支付
And everything's in cash up front,

833
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,970
可能还预支了五年的费用
probably paid five years in advance.

834
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,620
但玛丽·安没法告诉你  因为她不能说话
And Mary Ann couldn't tell you because she doesn't speak.

835
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,690
所以我们根本没有证据
Which mean we don't have any proof.

836
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,330
你要去哪
Where are you going?

837
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,240
我去找证据
I'm gonna go get us some proof.

838
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,500
这是你发现的吗
You did this?

839
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,710
迈克和我一起
Mike and I both did.

840
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,260
那他为什么没来
Then why isn't he here?

841
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,580
你知道原因
You know why.

842
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,310
因为功劳大半在你
Because it was more you than him.

843
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,420
干得不错  瑞秋
You did a good job, Rachel.

844
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,680
购物  租碟
Shopping, renting videos.

845
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,000
你一定快被逼疯了吧
You must be going stir-crazy.

846
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,660
没关系
That's all right.

847
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,160
我停职期快满了
My suspension is about to expire.

848
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,390
对啊  换作是我可不敢指望
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.

849
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,900
我们发现玛丽·安了
We found Mary Ann.

850
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,920
我听说她在新疗养院过得不错
I'm told she's doing well at the new facility--

851
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,850
傅滋曼的公司付钱的那家
you know, the one Forstman's paying for.

852
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,770
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

853
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,540
我不是来利用你的悲剧  埃里克
I'm not here to exploit your tragedy, Eric.

854
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,780
我是来告诉你  一切都结束了
I'm here to tell you it's over.

855
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,930
如果真的结束了
Well, if this were over,

856
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,990
你现在会跟跟肖恩·卡荷尔在一起
you'd be with Sean Cahill right now,

857
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,280
所以你是来找我达成协议的
which means you're still looking for me to cut a deal.

858
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,230
我是来找你对付傅滋曼的
I'm looking for you to turn on Forstman.

859
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,330
你三天内两次来找我
You accost me for the second time in three days

860
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,950
还搬出了玛丽·安的名字
and throw Mary Ann's name around

861
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,800
作为你的谈判筹码
like a bargaining chip,

862
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,510
你觉得我会帮你吗
and you think I'm gonna help you?

863
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,240
去死吧
Drop dead.

864
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,740
埃里克  拜托了
Eric, please.

865
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,940
我知道要找一个你在乎的人
The reason I knew to look for someone that you cared about

866
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,020
是因为傅滋曼也那样对过我
was that Forstman did the same thing to me.

867
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,700
他发现你的弱点  然后利用弱点
He finds your weakness and presses down

868
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,270
直到你不再有对抗他的意志
until you don't have the will to stand up to him.

869
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,120
你的弱点是得了老年痴呆症的前妻
With you, it was an ex-wife with Alzheimer's.

870
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,350
而我
With me...

871
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,200
就是有赌瘾的弟弟
it was a little brother addicted to gambling.

872
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,330
我才不管
I don't care.

873
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,520
你没证据
You don't have proof,

874
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,690
再过一天你也找不到
and you're not gonna get it in the next 24 hours.

875
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,970
你说得对  我没有
You're right. I don't.

876
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,450
可问题是
But here's the thing.

877
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,420
卡荷尔可能有时间期限  但我没有
Cahill may have a deadline, but I don't,

878
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,290
我也不在乎要花多长时间
and I don't care how long it takes,

879
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,900
要是你不去对付傅滋曼的话
because I'm gonna find that proof

880
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,720
我一定会对那份证据追查到底
if you don't turn on Forstman.

881
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,040
很多人不知道这事
A lot of you don't know this,

882
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,560
但实际上  我恨死诺玛了
but the truth is, I hated Norma.

883
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,370
我讨厌她的木屐
I hated her clogs,

884
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,750
她的胡子
her mustache,

885
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,040
又丑又傻的应季毛衣
her stupid seasonal sweaters.

886
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,420
但我最讨厌的是
But the thing I hated most about her

887
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,040
她老是喜欢炫耀
was her favorite story

888
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,970
1975年阿贝·维高达[美国演员]向她求过婚
about how Abe Vigoda asked her to marry him in 1975.

889
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,430
大家都懂的
I mean, we get it.

890
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,950
你曾美丽又性感
You were hot.

891
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,080
拒绝他的求婚
You turned him down,

892
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,040
是你这辈子最后悔的事
and it was the biggest regret of your life.

893
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,400
就像你说过的所有事一样
And like everything you ever said,

894
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,550
当时令我难以忍受
I couldn't stand it at the time.

895
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,900
但现在你不在了
But now that you're gone,

896
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,930
我终于明白你话里的含义
I understand what you meant.

897
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,030
莫错过光阴
Don't let the moment pass.

898
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,580
莫在未表白心意前
Don't let the people you love walk by you

899
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,930
就放手爱人  任其离开
without letting them know how you feel about them,

900
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,780
因为放手一瞬  后悔一生
because life slips by, and then it's over.

901
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,630
现在我要告诉你  你对我来说有多重要
And I'm not gonna let another minute pass me by

902
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,140
不会再让一分一秒从身边溜走
without letting you know how much you mean to me.

903
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,760
诺玛  我爱你
I love you, Norma.

904
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,550
谢谢  路易
Thank you, Louis.

905
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,190
致辞很感人
That was a lovely ceremony.

906
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,270
说的真好  路易
That was beautiful, Louis.

907
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,880
没有你我做不到的
I couldn't have done it without you.

908
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,140
-你就别谦虚了  -本来就是
- Oh, that's not true. - Yeah, it is.

909
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,160
没有你点醒我  我都不知道自己的感受
I couldn't even see how I felt without you showing me.

910
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,010
事实是  唐娜
And the truth is, Donna,

911
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,580
你比我自己还要了解我
you know me better than I know myself.

912
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,480
就像我之前说的  哈维根本不知道
Like I said, Harvey has no idea

913
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,910
拥有你是多幸运的一件事
how lucky he is to have you.

914
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,440
是在找我可能给埃里克·伍德尔的那笔钱吗
Looking for the money I supposedly gave Eric Woodall?

915
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,750
你是来直接认罪  帮我省事的吗
You want to save me the trouble and just admit what you did?

916
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,250
不是  要是那样还有什么意思
No, where would be the fun in that?

917
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,610
好  你继续玩吧
Fine. Keep playing your games,

918
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,380
但这一次  你必败无疑
but this time, you're gonna lose.

919
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,510
为什么  你以为你说服了伍德尔供出我吗
Why, because you think you convinced Woodall to give me up?

920
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,220
没错  他来找我了
Yeah, he came to see me.

921
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,770
说你想让他出卖我
Said you tried to get him to turn me in.

922
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,680
我说的是  你是个傲慢的混蛋
What I said was, you're an arrogant bastard

923
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,950
整天盘算着怎么利用别人
who's spent his life manipulating people.

924
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,350
那你就是个只关心输赢的废柴
And you're the loser who only cares about competition.

925
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,360
赢不了我  怪我咯
Not my fault you can't beat me.

926
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,550
这次我可以
I can this time.

927
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,080
我不觉得  伙计  因为...
Oh, I don't think so, pal, because...

928
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,890
他卖我  我就卖你
he turns on me, I turn on you.

929
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,300
如果你说的是十二年前的那件事  容我提醒下
If you're talking about 12 years ago, let me remind you.

930
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,690
我们都参与其中了
We were both part of that deal.

931
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,110
是的
Yes, we were.

932
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,210
我们三个都参与了  我  你  和你弟弟
All three of us were-- you, me, and your brother.

933
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,690
你别把我弟弟搅和进来
You leave my brother out of this.

934
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,780
想都别想
Not a chance.

935
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,870
要是你非不放过伍德尔这事
And you don't leave this Woodall thing alone,

936
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,710
那么我完蛋的那天
by the time I'm done,

937
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,100
所有人都会知道十二年前
all anybody will know about 12 years ago

938
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,650
是你给了条建议
is you gave me a tip

939
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,870
确保你的弟弟能从中获利
and made sure your little brother profited from it.

940
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,610
我屁都没有给过你
I didn't give you shit.

941
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,400
你骗我给你透内部消息
You tricked me into giving you inside information

942
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,600
然后给马库斯一笔
and then blackmailed me

943
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,440
他自己都不知道是赃款的钱来勒索我
by giving Marcus money he didn't even know was dirty.

944
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,980
那或许是真相
That may be the truth,

945
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,770
但他们不会从我这里听到
but they're never gonna hear it from me.

946
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,970
恐怕他们刚刚就听到了
I'm afraid they just did.

947
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,130
你好啊  查尔斯
Hi, Charles.

948
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,050
我是肖恩·卡荷尔  很高兴见到你
Sean Cahill. Nice to meet you.

949
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,900
你他妈是谁
Who the hell are you?

950
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,860
我是证监会里还没被你收买的人
I'm the guy from the SEC that isn't in your pocket.

951
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,060
我让肖恩去跟踪伍德尔
I asked Sean to follow Woodall.

952
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,820
做不到  我没有权限
Couldn't. No authorization.

953
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,940
但是要获得跟踪你的授权
But I had no problem getting authorization

954
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,940
就没什么难度
to follow you.

955
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,200
所以我才知道什么时候该把它打开
Which is how I knew when to turn this on.

956
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,210
你竟然戴了窃听器
You're wearing a goddamn wire?

957
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,980
某人还说自己最爱的电影是《华尔街》呢
For someone whose favorite movie is Wall Street,

958
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,660
这都没发现  真是丢人啊
that's got to be pretty embarrassing.

959
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,700
你个混蛋
Son of a bitch.

960
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,660
查尔斯  十二年前你或许赢了我
You may have gotten the better of me 12 years ago, Charles,

961
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,380
但这次  你没有
but this time, you didn't.

962
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,540
记住这种感觉  因为我知道我会的
So remember what it feels like, because I know I will.

963
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,710
哈维  这事没完
Harvey, this isn't over.

964
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,470
我见过的每个输家都这么说
Words spoken by every loser I've ever met.

965
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,020
回见  伙计
See you around, pal.

966
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,570
二换二
Two for two.

967
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,930
他没碰我的球
He didn't touch my balls.

968
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,560
黑咖  两块方糖  再加一点香草
Black, two sugars, splash of vanilla.

969
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,100
你怎么知道我喝咖啡的习惯
How do you know that's how I take my coffee?

970
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,120
跟知道你不会接受那份工作同样的渠道
The same way I know you're not taking that job.

971
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,420
你知道我不会接是因为我今天来上班了
You know I'm not taking that job because I came into work today.

972
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,760
不  斯佩克特先生
No, Mr. Specter.

973
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,980
那天晚上你从我身边走开的时候
I knew you weren't taking that job

974
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,420
我就知道你不会接那份工作
the second you walked away from me the other night.

975
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,000
早跟你说过我对别人的了解比他们自己还透彻
I told you I know people better than they know themselves.

976
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,450
那蒂娜怎么办
Well, what did you do with Tina?

977
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,030
我让贝莎重新分配了
Oh, I had Big Bertha reassign her.

978
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,810
-分给谁了  -你真的关心吗
- To who? - Do you really care?

979
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,500
-毫不关心  -很好
- Not a bit. - Good.

980
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,850
条件是这样
Here's the deal.

981
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,180
我可以为你挡子弹
I will take a bullet for you.

982
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,440
当然不是在说真的子弹
And I don't mean that literally.

983
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,490
但是你要为我做的是
But what you do for me is,

984
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,250
我需要什么的时候  你也要给我
when I need something, you give it to me.

985
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,990
我们的合作是互相的
It's not just a one-way street.

986
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,580
此外你还会真正做秘书的工作吗
Will you also do some actual secretarial work?

987
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,560
看我是怎么安排你的日程表的  牛人
Take a look at what I did with your calendar there, hotshot.

988
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,040
老天啊
Holy shit.

989
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,570
你什么时候做好的
When'd you get that done?

990
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,690
我说过我不是一般的秘书
I told you I'm not like every other secretary.

991
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,780
我可是唐娜
I'm Donna.

992
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,680
那我们开始工作吧
Then let's get to work.

993
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,950
不过顺便说一句  我喝咖啡不加香草
But for the record, I don't take vanilla with my coffee.

994
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,740
你尝过以后就会加了
You will after you taste that.

995
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,820
天呐  真好喝
Oh, my God, this is awesome.

996
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,790
这些人什么时候才会明白
When will they learn?

997
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,230
正是时候
Perfect timing.

998
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,990
而我们要庆祝什么
And what are we celebrating?

999
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,290
我们的胜利
Our win.

1000
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,930
"我们的胜利"
"Our win."

1001
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,770
-我喜欢这说法  -我也喜欢
- I like the sound of that. - Me too.

1002
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,090
你去哪了
Where were you?

1003
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,750
我一会再说
I'll get into that in a minute.

1004
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,580
我想先和你谈谈
I want to talk to you for a second.

1005
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,780
怎么了
What is it?

1006
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,110
瑞秋  你知道我告诉过你我爱你
Rachel, you know I told you I loved you

1007
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,630
第一次见面我就说过
from the second I met you.

1008
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,560
你爱我的铅笔裙
Well, you loved my pencil skirt.

1009
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,120
我爱你的面容
I loved your face.

1010
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,370
你是我见过的最出色的女人
You're the most amazing woman I have ever met,

1011
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,630
你不止美貌
and you're not just beautiful,

1012
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,760
而且还甜美  善良  关心人
but you're sweet and caring and kind

1013
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,430
而且聪明坚强
and brilliant and tenacious.

1014
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,710
迈克  你...
Mike, are--

1015
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,570
你是在做我认为你在做的那件事吗
are you doing what I think you're doing?

1016
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,780
我今天给你父亲打过电话了
I called your father today.

1017
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,340
然后我又把奶奶的戒指送去清洗干净了
And then I went to get Grammy's ring cleaned.

1018
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,570
天...
Oh, my--

1019
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,730
我不想花四十年时间
I don't want to go 40 years

1020
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,940
后悔自己为什么没早一天这样做
wondering why I didn't do this one day sooner.

1021
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,950
瑞秋·伊丽莎白·赞恩
Rachel Elizabeth Zane...

1022
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,170
我爱你
I love you...

1023
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,960
永生永世
and I always will.

1024
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,780
你是我生命的全部
You're my whole life.

1025
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,520
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

1026
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,550
愿意
Yes.

1027
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,150
-愿意吗  -愿意
- Yes? - Yes.

1028
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,570
-好  -来
- All right, - Here...

1029
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,060
天呐
Oh, my God.

1030
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,180
太漂亮了
It's beautiful.

1031
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:48,120
她一直戴了近六十年
She wore it every day for almost 60 years.

1032
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,000
我也会的
So will I.

1033
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,910
你好啊  蠢货
What's up, dickhead?

1034
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,850
你好啊  笨蛋
What's up, loser?

1035
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,780
哈维  听到你的声音真好
Hey, Harvey. Good to hear from you.

1036
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,400
怎么了  一切都还好吗
What's going on? Everything okay?

1037
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,030
没事  一切都很好
Yeah, everything's okay.

1038
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,460
我只是有段时间没和你说话了
I just haven't talked to you in a while

1039
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,890
想看看你怎么样
and wanted to see how you were doing.

1040
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,370

我就想听到这个

听我说  我考虑过你说的话了
Listen, I was thinking about what you said,

1055
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,600
关于我同情你
about me pitying you.

1056
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,970

1060
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:04,230
-我要离开你了  哈维  -什么

我不想再为你工作了
This isn't working for me anymore.

唐娜  我明白你的感受

1063

但你刚经历过太多大事
but you just went through something huge,

1064
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,100
受审什么的
with being on trial, and, uh...

1065
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,960
你需要过些时间再说
you need to give it time.

1066
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,900
不能就这样辞职
