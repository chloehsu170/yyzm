{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

14
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,050
我听说你今天上午要给接替我的人面试
I hear you're interviewing replacements this morning.

15
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:09,750
没错
I am.

16
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,620
-你工作做得好吗  -我是出色
- You good at what you do? - I'm great at what I do.

17
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,740
那你明天开始上班
Then you start tomorrow.

18
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,040
我想提议
I'd like to propose a change

19
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,950
对当前的薪酬计算方法进行调整
to the current compensation formula.

20
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,460
如果我们投票的话
How many partners do you have in your pocket

21
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,860
你能调动多少合伙人支持
if we put your proposal to a vote?

22
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,330
45%
I can get 45%.

23
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,500
我能帮你通过投票
I'm gonna get you the difference.

24
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,370
这是哈维最近三个案子的收益表
This is Harvey's last three income statements,

25
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,170
我发现它们被放在复印机里
and I found them sitting in the copy machine.

26
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,890
是你主动为我工作的  你该作出决定了
You came to work for me, so now it's time for you to decide.

27
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,920
你到底要不要站在我这边
Are you with me or not?

28
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,420
我刚刚要求进行投票
I just called for a vote,

29
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,030
希望你有存钱的习惯
and I hope you've been saving your money,

30
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,390
因为你那钱多事少的工作马上就要没了
because your gravy train's about to leave the station.

31
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,990
-我打911  -这不是心脏病突发
- Okay, I'm dialing 911. - It's not a heart attack.

32
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,480
这是恐慌症
It's a panic attack.

33
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,930
记得我说过  我会找你
Remember when I said if I wanted you to make up

34
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,660
弥补薪金投票的事情吗
for the compensation vote I would come to you directly?

35
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,790
现在我来了
Well, now I am.

36
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,390
我们来回顾一下你的光荣历史
Well, let's take a look at your resume.

37
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,230
篡改证词  勒索  贿赂
Witness tampering, extortion, bribery.

38
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,510
伪造证据很适合你
Forgery fits right in.

39
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,740
我还真调查过你妈妈
I actually looked into your mommy,

40
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,210
结果发现  你跟爸爸待在家里时
And it turns out that the whole time

41
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,220
你妈妈在外面搞...
you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--

42
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,140
哈维  最近还好吗
Hey, harv. How's it going?

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,740
你能确定那男人
You're absolutely certain the man

44
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,220
就是这个叫特拉维斯・坦纳的
was this Travis Tanner person?

45
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,150
是的
Yes.

46
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,970
你也很确定那女人不是唐娜
And yet you're just as certain the woman wasn't Donna?

47
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,210
我说过了
That's what I said.

48
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,600
我知道  但你没说她是谁
I know that, but you haven't said who she was.

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,420
你为什么那样看着我
Why are you looking at me like that?

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,650
你知道为什么
You know why.

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,970
我不知道她是谁
I don't know who she was.

52
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,610
好吧  这么说吧
Okay, then let's try this.

53
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,460
你觉得为什么特拉维斯・坦纳
Why do you think Travis Tanner all of a sudden

54
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,300
会突然跑进你的潜意识里
popped into your subconscious?

55
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,150
因为我现在正处理的案子对方是他
Because I'm in the middle of a case against him.

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,870
既然你不愿意再聊你的梦了
Well, since you don't want to talk about the dream anymore,

57
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,430
不如聊聊这个案子
why don't we talk about the case?

58
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,150
一点都不吓人
That's not creepy at all.

59
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,940
我就想知道你为什么换发型
I was just wondering why you changed your hair.

60
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,360
我一直就这发型啊
Hair's the same as it's always been.

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,180
你想看着老一点  还是年轻点
You trying to look older? Younger?

62
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,530
不管想怎么样  都不成功
Whatever it is, it isn't working.

63
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,470
你说完了吗  我在努力
Are you finished? 'Cause I'm actually trying

64
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,020
赶计费工时呢
to catch up on some billables here.

65
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,960
我只是顺路过来给你个小礼物
Hey, I just stopped by to give you a little gift

66
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,440
祝贺你赢下赞恩的案子的
for winning the Zane case.

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,920
礼物  你从没在案子结束后给过我礼物
A gift? You've never given me a gift after a case.

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,640
不是这样的
That's not true.

69
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,640
仔细想想  你都从没恭喜过我
Come to think of it, you've never even congratulated me,

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,550
也就是说  你来的真正目的是
which means you're actually here because,

71
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,200
天呐  你想我了
oh, my god, you miss me.

72
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,670
-我确实...没想你  -你还好吗
- I did...not miss you. - Are you okay?

73
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,770
你今晚想过来我家吗
Do you want to come over tonight?

74
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,400
我们可以看《西雅图夜未眠》
We can watch ?Sleepless in Seattle.

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,220
-你想不想要礼物了  -什么礼物
- Do you want your gift or not? - That's it?

76
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,070
这礼物看起来像文件夹
My gift looks a lot like a folder.

77
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,170
是个案子
It's a case.

78
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,140
咱俩一起绝杀特拉维斯・坦纳
You and me killing it against Travis Tanner.

79
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,470
-跟以前一样  -一样
- Just like old times? - Just like old times.

80
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,700
-那我们还等什么呢  -不等什么
- Well, what are we waiting for? - Nothing.

81
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,020
他正在来提和解协议的路上
He's on his way over with a settlement offer right now.

82
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,310
和解  听着不像坦纳的风格
Settlement? That doesn't sound like Tanner.

83
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,410
-正是他的风格  -怎么会
- Sounds exactly like Tanner. - How's that?

84
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,810
他已经开始挥白旗了
He's starting off waving a white flag.

85
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,710
他只是在明修栈道
Yeah, he's doing it just to go behind our backs

86
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,930
背地想暗渡陈仓
so he can attack our flank.

87
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,310
你意思说我们得小心提防
So you're saying we need to watch our flank.

88
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,410
不  我说咱们得渡他的陈仓
No, I'm saying we need to attack his.

89
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,770
-怎么了  -我要说实话
- What? - I'm just gonna say it.

90
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,960
我们每次对上坦纳都不轻松
Every time we go up against Tanner, it gets brutal.

91
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,870
你那天刚恐慌症发作过
You just had a panic attack the other day,

92
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,330
你真的确定现在要这么做吗
so are you sure this is really what you need right now?

93
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,520
我现在正需要这么做
It's exactly what I need right now.

94
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,870
我们去灭掉他
Let's go get him.

95
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,560
路易  这是什么
Louis? What's this?

96
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,180
那代表了我的谢意
That is a token of my appreciation.

97
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,020
你让我相信哈维不会伤害埃斯特  你是对的
You told me to trust Harvey with Esther and you were right.

98
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,600
现在我跟哈维和好了
Now Harvey and I are good.

99
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,580
你要想每次我说对
Well, if you're gonna give me a gift

100
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,880
都给我份礼物的话
every time I turn out to be right,

101
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,590
我就得需要一个大点的公寓了
then I'm gonna need a bigger apartment.

102
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,450
不是每次都有  但这次必须给
Well, not every time, but this time.

103
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,480
你的泥浴俱乐部  我要去做泥浴
Your mud club. I'm going mudding?

104
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,550
其实更棒
Even better.

105
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,430
我们要一起去做泥浴
We are going mudding.

106
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,500
路易  我不知道要说什么
Wow, Louis. I don't know what to say.

107
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,120
这...
This is, um....

108
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,910
-很棒  -不太合适
- Wonderful? - Inappropriate.

109
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,590
拜托  唐娜
Oh, come on, Donna.

110
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,910
我觉得你没理解
I don't think you understand.

111
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,040
想象一下
Picture this.

112
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,220
你和我  并排躺着  全裸
You and me, side by side, completely naked,

113
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,440
我们的身体埋在大地母亲的汁液之下
our bodies covered in the juices of mother earth.

114
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,620
现在我理解它完全是合适的
Oh, yeah, now I can see exactly how it's totally appropriate.

115
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,660
没错
Exactly.

116
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,030
唐娜  相信我
And Donna, trust me.

117
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,750
你第一次踏入我的泥浆的温暖怀抱时
When you dip your virgin toe in the deep warmth of my mud,

118
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,170
会脱胎换骨
you're never gonna be the same again.

119
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,370
杰西卡  我们有问题了
Jessica, we have a problem.

120
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,570
我看了律所章程
I went through the bylaws.

121
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,840
结果发现我们新的薪酬结构
Turns out the new compensation structure is in violation

122
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,260
违反了C35节
of subsection C35.

123
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,730
所以投票本身就是无意义的
So the vote in itself is moot.

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,070
你是说我们得改回
So you're saying we're going back

125
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,060
旧的薪资结构去
to the old compensation structure?

126
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,050
不是我说的  是条款C35说的
No, I'm not saying that. Subsection C35 is saying that.

127
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,600
只有一个问题
There's only one problem.

128
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,670
条款C35  24小时前还不存在呢
Subsection C35 didn't exist 24 hours ago.

129
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,450
-杰西卡  -别废话了  路易
- Jessica-- - Cut the shit, Louis.

130
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,240
告诉我你到底想干嘛
Tell me what this is really about.

131
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,470
我想和哈维重归于好
It's about me trying to make things right with Harvey.

132
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,170
我对此完全没意见
And I have no problem with that.

133
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,030
但我还需要你弥补咱俩的关系
But I also need you to make things right with me.

134
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,540
什么意思
What are you talking about?

135
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,410
这个投票是对我权威的一次冲击
That vote was an assault on my power.

136
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,540
我要让这事昏过去
I sneak this by,

137
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,590
我就拿不回我的权威了
I don't get my power back.

138
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,330
那会让我沦落到你和杰克的境地
It just makes me the same as you and Jack.

139
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,210
所以你不能像你俩当初
So you're not going to undo this thing

140
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,050
用见不得人的手段通过投票那样
the same shady way that the two of you

141
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,220
偷偷摸摸地让决议失效
passed it in the first place.

142
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,310
杰西卡  我说了
Jessica, I told you,

143
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,220
我把哈维的薪金表留在复印机里
leaving Harvey's compensation in the copier

144
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,310
是个意外
was an accident.

145
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,260
圣诞老人还从烟囱里爬下来
And a man named Santa Claus climbs down chimneys

146
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,990
把礼物送到圣诞树下呢
and leaves presents under trees.

147
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,520
好吧  行了  我明白了
Okay, fine, I get it.

148
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,420
你不相信我
You don't believe me.

149
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,470
但我要如何说服那些高级合伙人
But how the hell am I supposed to convince the senior partners

150
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,490
从自己的口袋里掏钱出来呢
to take money out of their own pockets?

151
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,640
那就是你的问题了
That's your problem.

152
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,530
你想要撤销那条决议  那就发起投票吧
You want to reverse that policy, bring it up for a vote.

153
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,410
爷们点
Like a man.

154
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,700
{\an8}皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所

155
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,310
打扰了  小老虎
Excuse me, tiger.

156
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,310
你不想要在接待处登记一下吗
Don't you want to check in at reception?

157
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,400
-我知道我要去哪里  -你不知道
- Oh, I know where I'm going. - No, you don't.

158
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,740
我猜你知道我是谁  但你不是唐娜
Yeah, I'd say you know who I am, but you're not Donna.

159
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,880
我的确不是  但我确实知道你是谁
No, I'm not. But I do know who you are.

160
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,380
那你也知道我是来见谁的了
Well, then you know who I'm here to see.

161
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,390
我还知道你第一次来这里的时候
I also know that the very first time you ever came here,

162
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,690
直接穿过保安绕过唐娜
you walked right past security and by Donna.

163
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,120
但就像你说的  我不是唐娜
But like you just said, I'm not Donna.

164
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,590
我喜欢你  你今天顶她班吗
I like you. You filling in for the day?

165
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,070
不关你的事
None of your business.

166
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,460
我是说  等红发小姐回来后
Hey, I'm just saying, when red gets back,

167
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,660
也许你会愿意来替我工作
maybe you want to come work for me.

168
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,990
我已经有工作了
I already have a job.

169
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,880
如今的任务就是把您这尊大神
And right now it's getting your sorry ass

170
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,620
请到会议室去
into the conference room.

171
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,300
那你要怎么办
So what are you gonna do?

172
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,450
只有一个办法了
The only thing I can do.

173
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,750
让哈维求我另外一件事吧
Get Harvey to ask me for something else.

174
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,710
不行  不可能
No, not an option.

175
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,520
唐娜  我搞定这个的唯一办法
Donna, the only way I can get this done

176
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,640
就是让杰克・索罗夫帮忙
is with Jack Soloff's help,

177
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,470
但他是没可能会撤销那个
and there is no way that he's gonna reverse

178
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,690
让他一战成名的提案的
the very same proposal that put him on the map.

179
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,810
我来告诉你哈维会怎么做
I'll tell you what Harvey would do.

180
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,330
我不在乎哈维会怎么做
I don't care what Harvey would do,

181
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,340
因为我做不成哈维会做的事
Because I cannot do what Harvey would do.

182
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,130
哈维会怎么做
What would Harvey do?

183
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,440
他会想办法让杰克觉得值得这么做
He'd find a way to make it worth Jack's while.

184
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,020
让瑞秋给我一份下个月会进行的
Get Rachel to get me a list of every major corporate merger

185
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,420
重大合并项目列表
pending in the next month.

186
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,470
这才是我效力的路易
There is the Louis I came to work for.

187
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,480
说得没错  我来了  我要搞定这件事
You are right. Here I am. And I'm gonna get it done.

188
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,370
而当我搞定以后
And when I do,

189
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,520
你和我就要共享一次漫长的泥浴
you and I are going for a long, slow mud.

190
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,560
不  我不去
No, we're not.

191
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,440
假如你是来检查空气的
If you're here to check the air,

192
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
38楼就像桑拿房一样
it's like a sauna on the 38th floor.

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,350
很高兴见到你  哈维
Good to see you, Harvey.

194
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,980
很开心能看到有些人永远不会变
Nice to know some people never change.

195
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,550
没有风趣幽默的反驳吗  你怎么了
No witty rejoinder? What's going on?

196
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,820
老了力不从心了吗
You slowing down in your old age?

197
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,730
也可能是睾丸酮低
Could be low T.

198
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,730
{\an8}睾丸酮低直接影响性生活

199
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,910
我可以和你们扯一天的淡
And I could talk shit with you guys all day,

200
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,670
但我来这里是因为我关心我的客户
but I'm here because I care about my client.

201
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,890
也许你的客户就不该试图
Well, then maybe your client shouldn't have tried

202
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,610
用偷来的知识产权开公司
to launch a company with stolen IP.

203
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,190
那知识产权不是偷的
That IP wasn't stolen.

204
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,780
是阿丽莎自己创造的
Alyssa created it herself.

205
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,530
是不是她创造的不重要
It doesn't matter whether she created it or not.

206
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,940
她签署了协议说所有权在我们
She signed a contract that says we own it,

207
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,150
而且存在她最后一天上班后带回家的
and it was on our laptop that she took home

208
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,020
我们的笔记本电脑上
on her last day.

209
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,190
我们不会让你带着我们的东西走出那扇门的
And we're not letting you walk out the door with our property.

210
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,070
好吧  我告诉过你了这和我无关
Okay, I told you this isn't about me.

211
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,180
行了  你想要什么  坦纳
Okay, what do you want, Tanner?

212
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,260
我想要提供一份协议
I want to make an offer.

213
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,640
阿丽莎愿意给你们15%的股权
Alyssa is willing to give you a 15% stake

214
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,720
请你们放手
to drop this whole thing.

215
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,330
就算她全给我们也没用
She could make it 100% for all I care.

216
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,430
-我们不和解  -你们不用和解
- We're not settling. - You don't have to settle,

217
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,430
但你确实得把那份提议给你们的客户看
but you do have to present that offer to your client

218
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,180
你清楚的
and you know it.

219
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,680
我会的  只不过需要先把它从屁话
I will, I just need to get it translated

220
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,430
翻译成英语
from bullshit to English.

221
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,870
哈维  看着我  那份提议很合理
Harvey, look at me. That's a fair offer.

222
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,940
不  你看着我  告诉我
No, you look at me and tell me

223
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,280
你没有在我们背后耍花招
and tell me you're not doing something behind our backs right now.

224
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,740
-我没有  -但是我们有
- I'm not. - Well, we are.

225
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,590
你的秘书说在这次会议前
Your secretary said you wouldn't file a TRO

226
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,920
你是不会申请临时禁制令的
until after this meeting.

227
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,650
我们是没有
Oh, we didn't.

228
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,380
但是我们发现兰小姐欠了一大笔债
Turns out that Miss Lang has some outstanding debts,

229
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,100
所以我们就去把它们买了下来
so we just went ahead and bought those up

230
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,030
取得了她财产的扣押权
and put a lien on her property.

231
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,320
我们说话这会儿警察正在封她办公室
The sheriff's padlocking her offices as we speak.

232
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,430
哈维  别这么做  你会后悔的
Harvey, don't do this. You'll be sorry.

233
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,480
这话留着跟法官说去吧
Tell that to the judge.

234
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,990
明天一早我们就去申请临时禁制令
We're filing that TRO in the morning.

235
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,920
我告诉你  我不是从前的我了
I'm telling you, I'm not the guy I used to be,

236
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,840
但假如你扇我一巴掌
but if you hit me,

237
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,670
我可不会把另半边脸也凑过去给你打
I'm not turning the other cheek.

238
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,360
我会还手的
You're gonna get hit back.

239
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,440
你为什么这么高兴
What are you so happy about?

240
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,360
我说了  这正是我需要的
I told you, it's exactly what I needed.

241
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,280
你和这个人针锋相对多少次了
You've gone up against this man how many times?

242
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,850
多到足够知道他是个垃圾
Enough to know that he's a piece of shit

243
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,890
为了赢会不惜牺牲所有底线
that'll cross whatever line it takes to win.

244
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,470
我听过的全是你牺牲的底线
All I've heard so far is the line that you crossed.

245
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,550
听着  你也许懂得人情世故
Listen, you may understand some things about people,

246
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,620
但你不懂我做的事
but you don't understand what I do.

247
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,710
在我听来  你做的事就是
Well, it sounds to me like what you did was attack a man

248
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,310
攻击一个已经投降的人
that was waving a white flag.

249
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,450
你刚才在听我说话吗
Were you listening?

250
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,340
他不是投降  是在设局陷害我们
He wasn't waving a white flag, he was setting us up.

251
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,020
你怎么能如此肯定呢
How can you be so sure?

252
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,150
因为我了解坦纳
Because I know Tanner.

253
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,850
如果你这么清楚他的能力
Okay, well, if you know so well what he was capable of,

254
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,100
为什么还要故意和他作对
why was it such a good idea to pick a fight with him?

255
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,120
因为这就是我的风格
Because it's what I do.

256
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,700
也许是时候考虑改变一下你的行事风格了
Well, maybe it's time to consider changing what you do.

257
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,160
好吧  那这样
Okay, here we go.

258
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,540
金坦公司和猎户制药怎么样
What about Gentech and Orion pharmaceuticals?

259
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,780
大并购  胜诉提成还有大赢面
Monster merger, contingent fee, and huge upside.

260
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,850
但奎瓦施在律师团队中
And Cravath is listed as the attorney of record,

261
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,900
所以如果他们退出  整个事就暴露了
which means if they swap out, it blows the whole thing up.

262
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,050
这个是最后一个了
Okay, well, that's the last one.

263
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,080
该死
Shit.

264
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,520
这个一直都在这里
Wait, this has been here the whole time.

265
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
约翰・德摩尔怎么样
What about John Dellmore?

266
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,980
他们要和阿尔金金融合并
They're merging with Arkin financial.

267
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,320
还没公布  就是在等着我们
Haven't been announced yet, it's just sitting there

268
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,750
-去收割啊  -不可能
- ripe for the taking. - No, not gonna happen.

269
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,550
德摩尔和哈蒙舒普合作几十年了
Dellmore's been with Harmon and Shupe for decades.

270
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,240
那又怎样  哈蒙舒普是个三流律所
So what? Harmon and Shupe is a third-tier law firm

271
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,100
舒普就是个笑话
And Shupe is a joke.

272
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,910
她也是约翰・德摩尔的妻子
She's also John Dellmore's wife.

273
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,280
也许我们能说服德摩尔
Well, so then maybe we can convince Dellmore

274
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,100
他妻子是个荡妇
that his wife is a trollop.

275
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,820
-路易  -他妈的
- Louis! - God damn it!

276
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,900
到底怎么了
What is going on?

277
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,950
我得让杰克・索罗夫推翻之前的薪金方案投票
I need Jack Soloff to overturn the compensation vote,

278
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,800
唯一的方法就是找到
and the only way for me to do that is to bring in

279
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,440
一个大额胜诉提成客户
a big contingent client.

280
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,830
然后和他分享收益
And share the money with him.

281
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,150
正是  但这些客户都没用
Exactly! And none of these people are it.

282
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,210
好吧
Okay.

283
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,330
等等  你去哪
Wait, where are you going?

284
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,330
就像你说的  这些客户都没用
Like you said, none of these people are it.

285
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,690
很晚了  我们都累了
It's late, we're both exhausted,

286
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,940
我明早还有个考试
and I've got a test in the morning.

287
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,990
瑞秋  拜托了
Rachel, please.

288
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,380
路易  对不起
Louis, I'm sorry.

289
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,180
我们明早再处理这件事  我保证
We'll work on it tomorrow morning, I promise.

290
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,130
瑞秋
Rach--

291
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,720
先生们  我很不喜欢没有充分理由发临时禁止令
Gentlemen, I don't like granting TROs without a good reason.

292
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,940
我们有充分理由  法官大人
We have a good reason, Your Honor.

293
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,060
它叫做合同
It's called a contract.

294
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,250
这份合同明确说明阿丽莎・兰
A contract that explicitly states that any product

295
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,390
在任职期间开发的任何产品
Alyssa Lang developed during her employment

296
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,890
都属于我的客户
is the property of our client.

297
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,250
很遗憾那份合同不可执行
Unfortunately that contract is unenforceable.

298
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,140
合同可执行  除非我今早是在俄罗斯醒来的
It is unless I woke up in Russia this morning.

299
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,720
法官大人  我这里有一份
Your honor, I have here a copy

300
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,380
阿丽莎・兰出生证明的副本
of Alyssa Lang's birth certificate.

301
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,510
她也许确实签了那份合同
She may have signed that contract,

302
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,690
但合同无效  因为她当时只有16岁
but it isn't binding because she was only 16 at the time.

303
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,640
什么
What?

304
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,670
法官大人  我了解这个人
Your honor, I know this man,

305
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,450
那份文件很可能来源非法
and that document could have come from anywhere.

306
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,160
文件已经经过匡提科的实验室证实
Get it verified by the labs at Quantico.

307
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,710
这份文件能证明阿丽莎・兰
All it's gonna prove is that Alyssa Lang

308
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,480
当时没有权利能力签署这份文件
had no legal capacity to sign.

309
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,290
她签署的时候多大并不重要
It doesn't matter how old she was when she signed it.

310
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,560
那是十年前的事情了
It was ten years ago.

311
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,870
自那之后的每张支票她都兑现了
She's cashed every paycheck she got since.

312
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,270
这可以作为你的庭审申辩
And you can argue that at trial,

313
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,190
但我们立法保护未成年人是有原因的
but we have laws protecting minors for a reason,

314
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,600
我不会签发禁令的
and I'm not granting a TRO.

315
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,710
还有一件事  法官大人
And one more thing, Your Honor.

316
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,590
我们已经全额支付  还清了她的债务
We have payment in full, discharging her debt,

317
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,450
在此要求她的公司恢复正常运营
and are requesting her doors be reopened.

318
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,340
这不是我们今天要讨论的事
That has nothing to do with why we're here.

319
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,680
留到庭审再说吧  斯佩克特先生  该吃饭了
Save it for trial, Mr. Specter. It's lunch.

320
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,310
我饿了  今天之内解除封锁
I'm hungry, and those padlocks are coming off today.

321
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,690
刚才是怎么回事
What the hell was that?

322
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,490
是你脸撞到拳击台地面的声音
That was the sound of your face hitting the canvas.

323
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,810
我建议你待着别起来了
I suggest you stay down.

324
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,280
我哪都不待  你这个混蛋
I'm not staying anywhere, you son of a bitch.

325
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,750
-你说什么  -你听到了
- Excuse me? - You heard me.

326
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,560
你的客户当时只有16岁
Your client was 16 years old

327
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,030
但你在洗心革面的说辞里
and you conveniently left that out

328
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,560
故意没提这件事
of your changed man speech.

329
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,020
我没告诉你是因为我知道
I didn't tell you about her because I knew

330
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,560
我说什么你都听不进去
you wouldn't listen to a thing I said

331
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,240
我给出了合理的条件
after I offered you a fair deal

332
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,400
可你让我滚
and you told me to go to hell.

333
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,670
瞎说  你不跟我们说是因为
Bullshit. You didn't tell us because

334
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,500
你想在法庭上搞突然袭击
you wanted to blindside us in court.

335
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,640
你才是那个在我伸出橄榄枝时
Hey, you're the one who turned out the lights out on Alyssa's business

336
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,110
非要针对阿丽莎的人
while I was extending an olive branch.

337
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,220
还是瞎说
Bullshit again.

338
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,500
我们都知道那个和解条件
We both know that settlement offer

339
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,060
只是为了让我们分心
was nothing but a distraction.

340
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,300
你想要分心吗
You want a distraction?

341
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,260
这是一份阿丽莎・兰
That is a draft of Alyssa Lang's

342
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,820
投诉你的客户性骚扰的草稿
sexual harassment complaint against your client.

343
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,580
因为我们开了条件  所以它还没有分你们的心
As far as our offer goes, it wasn't a distraction

344
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,940
因为我们还没有提交投诉
because we haven't filed that yet

345
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,570
我们的条件也依旧有效
and our offer's still on the table.

346
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,250
我建议你接受
I advise you to take it.

347
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,870
你不相信性骚扰的指控吗
You didn't believe the sexual harassment allegation?

348
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,270
-绝不相信  -为什么
- Not a chance. - Why not?

349
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,020
首先  这是坦纳说的
Well, for starters, it came out of Tanner's mouth.

350
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,160
而且我了解蒂姆・彼得罗夫  他没有出轨
And I know Tim Petroff, and he didn't cheat on his wife.

351
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,290
你为此很生气
And you're angry at him for that?

352
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,440
我当然生气了
You're damn right I am!

353
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,160
有些事情是不可以做的
There are some things you just don't do.

354
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,420
比如说谎吗
Like lie?

355
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,870
比如威胁要破坏人家的家庭
Like threaten to rip a man's family apart.

356
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,360
怎么了
What?

357
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,000
我只是觉得  你一个没结过婚的单身人士
I just find it interesting that you talk about family

358
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,510
把家庭说的那么神圣  很有趣
as if it were sacred, yet you've never married.

359
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,010
你从来没有过属于自己的家
You've never had a family of your own.

360
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,520
在这里我既没有看到通心粉画
I don't see any macaroni paintings

361
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,090
也没看到学校的相片
or school pictures in here either.

362
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,950
我的私人生活并不是今天的主题
And my personal life is not the topic here.

363
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,790
我们不如回到原本的主题
So why don't we get back to what is?

364
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,110
如果说跟坦纳开战真的是个好主意的话
If it was such a good idea to pick a fight with Tanner,

365
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,120
那你为什么会对这些你明知他会做的事情
why were you so angry at him for doing exactly

366
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,450
而感到生气呢
what you knew he would do?

367
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,950
你是医生  你告诉我
You're the doctor. You tell me.

368
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,160
好吧  可能因为把气撒在某个人的身上
Okay, maybe because getting angry at someone

369
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,280
是一个逃避自身麻烦的方法
is a way to avoid facing what's going on with yourself.

370
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,100
你回来了  真是太好了
Oh, good, you're back.

371
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,480
你在这里  肯定是有什么不好了
Can't be good if you're out here.

372
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,440
我不想让你毫无防备撞进去  你办公室里有...
Oh, I didn't want you to get ambushed. There's a--

373
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,120
贝塔软件的蒂姆・彼得罗夫
Tim Petroff of Betasoft in my office.

374
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,200
他已经在你的地毯上磨了半小时了
He's been wearing out your carpet for half an hour.

375
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,060
坦纳肯定已经把那份投诉给他了
Tanner must have sent him a copy of the complaint.

376
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,200
如果你指的是他手里攥的那张纸的话  是的
If you mean that paper balled up in his fist, I'd say he did.

377
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,720
多谢提醒  格蕾琴
Thanks for the heads-up, Gretchen.

378
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,830
蒂姆  在你开口之前
Tim, before you say anything--

379
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,910
性骚扰  这是什么鬼
Sexual harassment? What the hell is this?

380
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,720
这只是草稿  还没提交
It's only a draft. It hasn't been filed yet.

381
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,400
这话也算安慰吗
And that's supposed to make me feel better?

382
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,350
这根本就是谎言
It's a goddamn lie.

383
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,690
我连跟性骚扰有半点关系的事都没干过
I have never done anything remotely resembling harassing anyone.

384
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,330
-蒂姆  冷静点  -我才不要冷静
- Tim, calm down. - I'm not going to calm down.

385
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,620
这根本就是在曲解我的人格
This is a complete twisting of who I am.

386
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,540
我要这个女人身败名裂
I want this woman destroyed.

387
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,490
不是她干的  是她的律师
It's not her. It's her lawyer.

388
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,580
我不管
I don't care who it is.

389
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,170
我是有家室的人  我不想再看到这个
I have a wife and children, and I want this thing gone.

390
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,030
那你就应该了解下你桌上还有份和解协议
Then you should know there's a settlement on the table.

391
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,140
迈克  现在不是时候
Mike! Not now.

392
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,010
什么和解协议
What settlement?

393
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,500
她公司15%的股份
A 15% stake in her venture.

394
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,860
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,330
你觉得我会向这些靠敲诈勒索的人妥协吗
You think I'm gonna settle with these people based on blackmail?

396
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,380
没人要妥协
No one's settling.

397
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,040
是的  你说对了  没人妥协
Yeah, you're damn right no one's settling.

398
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,170
现在拿着你挣的钱  给我搞定这女人
Now earn your money and blow this woman out of the water.

399
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,120
你听到他说的了
You heard him.

400
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,090
找准机会把她彻底击倒  让她永无翻身之日
Figure out a way to put the screws to her once and for all.

401
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,660
哈维
Harvey.

402
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,460
我也不想再听到任何关于我心理状态的废话了
And I don't want to hear any shit about my state of mind.

403
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,790
我也并不打算说什么
I'm not gonna say anything about that,

404
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,610
但我要说的是  既然坦纳愿意让她这么做
but what I will say is that if Tanner's willing to make her do this,

405
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,740
怎么能保证他不会让她做
what's to say he's not willing to make her

406
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,070
更过分的事呢
do something worse?

407
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,760
你想做什么  迈克  你想让步吗
What do you want to do, Mike? You want to back down?

408
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,770
不  我想让坦纳被炒
No, I want to get Tanner fired.

409
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,270
可是我们跟她对话是违法的
It's not legal for us to talk to her.

410
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,760
可偶遇不违法啊
There's no law against me running into her by accident.

411
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,650
瑞秋  你在这里干嘛
Rachel, what are you doing here?

412
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,630
我到处在找你
I've been looking all over for you.

413
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,940
你意思不是  瑞秋  你考试怎么样吗
Don't you mean, "Hey, Rachel, how did your test go?"

414
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,830
我不在乎你考试考得怎么样
I don't care how your test went.

415
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,480
我需要你给我找到所有能找到的关于
I just need you to get me everything you can

416
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,270
约翰・德摩尔的资料
on John Dellmore.

417
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,310
路易  我们已经讨论过了
Louis, we've already been over this.

418
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,620
他的律师就是他老婆  你签不了他的
His lawyer's his wife. You're never gonna sign him.

419
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,250
那就是了  我不用真的签了他
Well, that's just it. I don't need to sign him.

420
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,430
我只要假装签了他就行
I only need to pretend to sign him.

421
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,380
这真是个坏主意
Okay. That's a bad idea.

422
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,470
不  才不是
No, it's not.

423
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,250
如果杰克以为我签到了德摩尔
If Jack thinks I signed Dellmore,

424
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,830
然后我告诉他我会分他一杯羹
and I tell him I'll give him a piece,

425
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,130
他知道这是一大笔钱
he'll know it's worth a fortune to him

426
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,200
然后他就会推翻投票了
and he'll overturn the vote.

427
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,240
那当他发现整件事都是个谎言的时候
And what are you gonna do when he finds out

428
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,480
你怎么办
the whole thing was a lie?

429
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,770
不会的  我会编几个悲伤感人的小故事
He won't. I'll make up some sob story

430
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,210
就讲德摩尔跟他老婆又和好了
about how Dellmore made up with his wife

431
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,310
我们要重振旗鼓  择日再战
and we'll live to fight another day.

432
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,810
他死都不会信的好吗
He's never gonna believe that.

433
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,990
瑞秋  换作是卡特里娜
Rachel, Katrina would have been

434
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,180
她从一开始就会答应
on board with this from day one.

435
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,140
好吧  路易  我很抱歉
Okay, Louis, I'm sorry.

436
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,460
我不是想泼你冷水
I am not trying to rain on your parade,

437
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,460
但一旦杰克发现了  他会恨你一辈子的
but when Jack finds out, he's going to hate you forever.

438
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,350
可是  我答应过哈维了
Well, I made a promise to Harvey.

439
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,930
如果让我在杰克恨我和
And if it's a choice between Jack hating me

440
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,420
和违背诺言之间选择
and breaking that promise,

441
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,770
那么我永远会选哈维
I'm picking Harvey every single time.

442
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,990
你到底需要什么
What exactly do you need?

443
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,150
我需要办法去晃花约翰・德摩尔的眼
I need a way to dazzle the shit out of John Dellmore.

444
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,440
谢谢
Thank you.

445
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,220
我不懂了  有人替我付过账了
I don't understand. My bill's been paid?

446
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,050
-是的先生  已经付过了  -谁付的
- Yes, sir, it has. - By who?

447
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,120
我付的
Uh, by me.

448
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,590
请问你是谁
And who exactly are you?

449
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,690
我是路易・利特
I'm Louis Litt.

450
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,780
而且我不仅替你结了帐
And not only did I pay for your check,

451
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,810
还给你带来了另一张支票
I also brought you another one.

452
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,490
你要给我的慈善基金捐5万块
You're donating $50,000 to my charity.

453
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,480
是的
Yes.

454
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,970
为什么
Why would you want to--

455
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,410
虽然看起来不像  但我也曾经无家可归
Because it may not look like it, but I was homeless.

456
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,870
有两年的时间都露宿街头
I spent two years on the streets,

457
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,070
要不是有您的机构帮忙
and had it not been for your family's organization,

458
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,790
我就不会有今天的成就
I would not be the man I am today.

459
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,150
我能做什么来感谢您吗
Is there anything I can do to thank you?

460
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,620
继续做您现在做的事就好了
Just keep doing what you're doing.

461
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,470
先生  你是个真正的美国英雄
You, sir, are a true American hero.

462
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,050
-谢谢你  -谢谢你
- Thank you. - Thank you.

463
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,650
太好了你在这儿
Oh, good, you're here.

464
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,170
刚是什么
What the hell was that?

465
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,970
是约翰・德摩尔
That was John Dellmore.

466
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,530
我知道他是谁
Yeah, I know who it is.

467
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,710
他抱你干嘛
Why was he giving you a hug?

468
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,810
因为我刚说服他  让咱俩处理他的并购案
Because I just convinced him to let us handle his merger.

469
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,240
你叫我过来跟这事有关系吗
Does that have something to do with why we're here?

470
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,630
我们就是为这个来的
It's got everything to do with why we're here,

471
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,700
因为我知道你永远不会相信
because I knew that you would never believe

472
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,210
我能拿下德摩尔这个客户
that I could close Dellmore.

473
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:54,940
没错
You're right.

474
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,990
如果不是亲眼所见  我是不会相信的
If I hadn't seen it myself, I never would have believed it.

475
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,140
为什么  因为我是个书呆子律师吗
And why is that? Because I'm a grinder?

476
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,250
是这样  杰克
Here's the thing, Jack.

477
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,530
你对付哈维时
When you took on Harvey,

478
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,400
你让书呆子律师站在了天才律师的对立面
you pitted the grinders against the rainmakers,

479
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,450
这招不错
and that was a good move,

480
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,440
但如果你想更进一步
But you want to move to the next level?

481
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,050
我们必须既赚工时也赚分成
We need to be both grinders and rainmakers.

482
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,200
你明白我的意思吗
Do you understand what I'm saying?

483
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,420
你是什么意思
What are you saying?

484
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,320
我是说我们必须
I'm saying that we need to revisit

485
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,350
重新制定薪金协议
the compensation agreement.

486
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,960
没门  我为什么要这么做
No way. Why would I do that?

487
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,140
因为要是我们接手这个客户
Because when we get this business,

488
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,540
我们就能赚一大笔钱
it will be worth a fortune to us.

489
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,520
-"我们"  -对  我们  杰克
- "Us"? - Yes, us, Jack.

490
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,080
如果你支持我
If you are with me on this,

491
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,280
我就把我赚的分你一半
I will give you 50 cents to every dollar that I make.

492
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,380
好  就这么定了
Yeah. Let's get this done.

493
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,100
小心  很烫的
Careful, it's really hot.

494
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,280
曾经有个女人因为被烫伤  起诉了麦当劳呢
A woman once sued McDonald's for getting burned.

495
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,910
不过我想你也可以假装被烫伤
Although I guess you could just say you got burned

496
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,970
然后起诉他们
and sue them anyway.

497
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,410
你是谁
Who are you?

498
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,200
我是谁不重要  重要的是我为谁工作
Doesn't matter who I am. It matters who I work for.

499
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,650
蒂姆・彼得罗夫
Tim Petroff.

500
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,130
你不能跟我说话
You can't talk to me.

501
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,210
我只是在调咖啡
I'm just fixing my coffee.

502
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,870
你想走随便你  但在你离开之前
You want to walk away, walk away, but before you do,

503
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,670
我要跟空气说
I'm gonna say to nobody in particular

504
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,330
你该炒了你的律师
that you should fire your lawyer.

505
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,760
我不会炒任何人
I'm not firing anybody.

506
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,540
那你该知道
Well, then you should also know that

507
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,630
诬告别人性骚扰
falsely accusing someone

508
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,640
可是犯罪
of sexual harassment is a criminal offense,

509
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,410
不管特拉维斯・坦纳跟你说了什么
and no matter what Travis Tanner has told you

510
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,700
说服你能够脱罪  脱不了的
to convince you that you'll get away with it, you won't.

511
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,960
我的指控中
There's nothing in that complaint

512
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,330
没有一条是假的
that isn't factually correct.

513
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,900
你在歪曲事实  这可能毁了一个人的一生
You are twisting those facts and you could ruin a man's life,

514
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,720
你知道的
and you know it.

515
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,640
这和他对我做的有什么区别
Oh, and how is that different from what he's doing to me?

516
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,540
-区别大了  -是吗
- It's completely different. - Is it?

517
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,420
十年来我每周为他工作六十小时
I worked for that man 60 hours a week for 10 years,

518
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,190
现在我想自己开公司
and now that I want to start my own company,

519
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,670
他不仅想打垮我
he not only wants to crush me,

520
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,830
还告诉别人我剽窃了他的创意
but he told people I stole the idea.

521
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,160
如果这都不算毁了别人的一生
If that's not ruining a person's life,

522
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,450
我不知道怎样才算
then I don't know what is.

523
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,660
至于特拉维斯・坦纳
Oh, and as far as Travis Tanner goes,

524
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,540
性骚扰不是他的主意
sexual harassment wasn't his idea.

525
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,700
是我的
It was mine.

526
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,280
他想劝我别这么做
And when he tried to talk me out of it,

527
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,020
我告诉他要么听我的
I told him he could either get on board

528
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,590
要么我就另请律师
or watch me get another lawyer.

529
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,750
瑞秋・赞恩  你真是荣耀的存在
Rachel Zane, you glorious creature.

530
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,430
-荣耀  -没错  荣耀
- Glorious? - Yes, glorious.

531
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,030
你是天才
I mean, you were masterful.

532
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,330
慈善基金的事
The charity,

533
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,370
他独自在他喜欢的餐厅吃午餐的事
his lone lunches at his favorite restaurant,

534
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,170
还让杰克出现得恰到好处
having Jack show up at the perfect time.

535
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,310
你不只是优秀的律师
I mean, you are not only a brilliant attorney,

536
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,550
你简直是主心骨啊
you're the backbone of this entire--

537
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,010
路易  我不会跟你去洗泥浴的
Louis, I'm not going mudding with you.

538
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,410
该死  唐娜跟你说什么了
God damn it! What did Donna tell you?

539
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,590
她说如果事情顺利
She told me that if it went well,

540
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,570
你会过来邀请我洗泥浴庆祝
you would come in here trying to get a celebratory mud,

541
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,990
如果事情不顺利
and that if it didn't go well,

542
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,230
你会邀请我洗泥浴安慰你
you would try to get a sympathy mud.

543
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,850
等等  我能跟你洗安慰泥浴吗
Wait a second, I could have got a sympathy mud?

544
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,630
不  不行
No, you couldn't.

545
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,150
但好消息是  你在杰克那里达到了目的
But the good news is, you got what you wanted with Jack,

546
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,260
不仅如此  路易  你还真正地
and on top of that, Louis, you really made a difference

547
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,980
为流浪儿童的生活做出了巨大的贡献
in the lives of homeless children.

548
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,940
提醒我了  投票之后
Which reminds me. After the vote,

549
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,320
你帮我止付那张支票
I want you to put a stop payment on that check.

550
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,320
不  这也太卑鄙了
Okay, no--that is a despicable thing to do.

551
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,000
得了  所有声称用于做好事的慈善基金
Please, any charity claiming to do a good thing

552
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,520
明显都是骗人的  我才不上当呢
is clearly a scam. I won't have it.

553
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,250
你的意思是你很小气吧
So you mean you're cheap?

554
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,080
作为一个不肯
You know what, for someone

555
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,340
陪我洗安慰泥浴的人
who won't throw me a sympathy mud,

556
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,560
你评论太多了
you're very judgmental.

557
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,010
路易  有事吗
Louis. What can I do for you?

558
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,450
你可以给我你的代表权
You can give me your proxy.

559
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,480
为什么
Why would I do that?

560
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,770
你让我爷们儿一点
Because you asked me

561
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,120
就薪金问题发起投票
to bring the compensation issue up for a vote

562
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,580
我做了
like a man and I did.

563
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,360
杰克・索罗夫知道吗
And is Jack Soloff aware of this?

564
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,980
他不只知道  还要投赞成票呢
Not only aware of it, he's voting for it.

565
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,180
你是怎么说服他的
And however did you get him to do that?

566
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,790
这么说吧  你想让我按哈维的方法
Let's just say that you wanted me to do this

567
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,220
而不是我的方法了结这事
like Harvey would have and not like I would have,

568
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,370
但我做到了两全其美
but I did the best of both.

569
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,350
那么你可以代表我了
Then you have my proxy.

570
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,840
哈维  我跟阿丽莎・兰谈过了
Harvey, I talked to Alyssa Lang

571
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,280
有些事该让你知道
and there's something you should know.

572
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,730
让我猜猜  她眨着她的大眼睛
Let me guess, she batted her eyes,

573
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,960
给你讲了个悲伤的故事
told you a sob story,

574
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,650
现在你认为她是无辜的
and now you think she's some kind of innocent.

575
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,630
不  不是这样
No, I don't.

576
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,890
事实上  她告诉我
In fact, she told me that

577
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,100
性骚扰的主意是她想出来的
the sexual harassment idea was hers.

578
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,010
我有什么必要知道这些
And why do I need to know that?

579
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,960
我觉得我们应该考虑接受交易
I think we should consider taking the deal.

580
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,640
不行
Well, we're not gonna do that.

581
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,360
为什么
Why not?

582
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,240
首先  蒂姆是不可能
Because first of all, there's now way on earth

583
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,250
接受和解的
that Tim's gonna settle.

584
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,970
你可以说服他  你知道的
You could convince him and you know it.

585
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,950
其次  那样起诉不可能
And second of all, there's no way on earth

586
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,120
是她的主意
that that suit was her idea.

587
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,430
哈维  你当时不在场
Harvey, you weren't there, all right?

588
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,090
没错  可我不必在那就知道
Yeah, I didn't have to be there to know

589
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,350
如果坦纳一开始就能说服她做那种事
that if Tanner could convince her to do that bullshit in the first place,

590
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,250
他定也可以让她说那是她自己的注意
he could sure as hell get her to say it was her idea.

591
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,100
他不可能知道我会联系她
He couldn't have known that I was gonna contact her.

592
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,200
他可能  也那么做了
He could, and he did.

593
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,630
别再跟我提这事了
And I don't want to hear another word about it.

594
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,080
你千方百计去让她开掉他的时候
And while you were away trying to get her to cut him loose,

595
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,960
我在这里想办法如何
I was here trying to figure out how to do

596
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,330
按蒂姆说的干掉她
what Tim asked us to do and blow her away.

597
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,360
哈维  这可不是玩笑事
Harvey, this isn't a joke.

598
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,830
我没开玩笑
I'm not joking.

599
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,180
唯一能让坦纳退却的
The only way to get Tanner to back down

600
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,870
就是给他迎头一击
is to point a cannon in his face.

601
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,560
你这不是给他迎头一击
You're not pointing it in his face.

602
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,310
是对她  一旦你起诉
You're pointing it in hers, and once you put this in motion,

603
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,200
就不一定能再回头了
there's no guarantee that you're gonna be able to pull it back.

604
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,410
她在雇特拉维斯・坦纳之前
She should have thought of that before

605
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,130
就该想到
she hired Travis Tanner.

606
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,690
我先介绍一下这个提议
Listen, I'm gonna start by introducing the proposal,

607
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,830
然后你就接进来
then you chime in.

608
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,570
杰克  我给你50%德摩尔
Jack, I gave you 50% of Dellmore,

609
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,650
但得让我看起来是这案子的主导
but I need to be seen as leading the charge on this.

610
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,850
路易  我告诉其他合伙人
Louis, I got the partners in line

611
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,250
这是我的提议才让他们加入我们
by telling them it was my proposal.

612
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,960
好  那我做引入  说全力支持你
Okay, so I'll introduce you with my full support

613
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,210
然后你接着讲
and then you can just take it from there.

614
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,870
-好的  -对了  我们搞定这事
- Okay. - Oh, and by the way, when we win this thing,

615
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,890
或许你和我可以一起泡泥浴
maybe you and I can go mudding together.

616
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,070
我们先认真把会开完吧
Why don't we just focus on our meeting?

617
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,280
好
Right.

618
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,390
首先我想感谢大家出席本次会议
First of all, I would like to thank everyone for coming.

619
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,510
这次要讨论的是杰克和我
The issue at hand is a very important proposal

620
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,100
努力研究出的一个重要提议
that Jack and I have been working on.

621
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,480
我获得了哈维和杰西卡的代理权
I have both Harvey and Jessica's proxies.

622
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,800
我很高兴这个方案得到他俩的支持
And I am pleased to say this measure has their full support.

623
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,740
-杰克  -谢谢  路易
- Jack. - Thank you, Louis.

624
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,150
考虑到最近律所新的
In light of the impact of recent changes in the firm

625
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,550
薪酬结构变动带来的影响
resulting from the new compensation structure,

626
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,420
路易和我都坚定地认为
Louis and I strongly feel that there should be

627
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,570
未来一年不该再有新的变动
no new policy changes for the next 12 months.

628
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,400
什么
What?

629
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,260
正如路易所说  冠名合伙人都同意了 
And as Louis just said, the name partners gave their blessing.

630
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,810
我们不如全体一致通过吧
So why don't we make it unanimous?

631
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,050
全都同意
All in favor?

632
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,050
看来提议被通过了
Motion seems to have passed.

633
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,510
下一个议程
Next order of business.

634
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,810
你刚才在搞什么鬼
What the hell did you just do?

635
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,510
我搞什么鬼  我只是保护自己的利益
What the hell did I do? I protected my own interests.

636
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,520
-我们谈好了的  -谈好了什么
- We had a deal! - We didn't have a thing.

637
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,260
你以为我会信餐厅那出约翰・德摩尔的戏吗
You think I bought that John Dellmore stunt at the restaurant?

638
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,530
你走到我桌边的时候我就看穿你了
I was on to you the second you walked over to my table.

639
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,290
我听你废话连篇
I let you give me that bullshit speech

640
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,820
书呆子律师和天才律师的话  只是为了
about grinders and rainmakers just so I could do

641
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,140
我能导演出刚才的好戏
what I just did.

642
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,890
好  我明白了
Okay, I get it.

643
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,440
你明确了态度  也建立了声望
You made your point, you made a name for yourself,

644
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,340
可是  杰克  你得推翻刚才的提议
but, Jack, you need to undo this.

645
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,810
你凭什么觉得我能够推翻
What makes you think I could have undone it

646
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,080
刚才的提议呢
in the first place?

647
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,550
他们投票同意那个提议
They voted for that proposal

648
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,320
是因为那增加了他们口袋里的钱
because it put more money in their pockets,

649
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,170
现在木已成舟
And now it's there to stay.

650
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,760
对了  如果你想约人泡泥浴
By the way, if you want to go mudding with someone,

651
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,400
为什么不找哈维・斯佩克特呢
why don't you ask Harvey Specter?

652
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,480
这件事用脚指头猜都知道
Because it doesn't take a genius to figure out

653
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,640
他才是让你干这个苦差事的
that he's the one that got you to carry his water

654
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,120
始作俑者
in the first place.

655
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,670
谢谢
Thanks.

656
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,110
我帮你叫了今日特选
I got you the special.

657
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,040
你说了不要腌菜吗
Did you say no pickles?

658
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,010
你没说不要腌菜啊
You didn't say no pickles.

659
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,430
我也没叫你帮我买午饭啊
I didn't say, "Order my lunch."

660
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,560
来告我呀
So sue me.

661
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,270
你把律师函发给坦纳了吗
You send the notification over to Tanner?

662
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,240
两小时前
Two hours ago.

663
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,490
那用不着很久了
Then it won't be long.

664
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,790
怎么了
What?

665
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,430
蒂姆・彼得罗夫来后我再没提过你的精神状态
I didn't say anything about your state of mind after Tim Petroff

666
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,720
因为那时我还不担心
because I wasn't worried about it then,

667
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,830
-但现在我担心了  -迈克
- but I am now. - Mike--

668
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,530
-如果失败了呢  -不会的
- What if it doesn't work? - It'll work.

669
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,340
-如果失败了呢  -也是坦纳的事
- And what if it doesn't? - Then it's on Tanner.

670
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,490
不  是你的事  我现在告诉你
No, it's on you, because I'm telling you right now,

671
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,280
坦纳没有操纵这件事
Tanner is not driving this thing.

672
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,200
说曹操曹操到啊
Well, speak of the devil.

673
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,780
你这个混帐
You son of a bitch.

674
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,090
你对我的委托人提起刑事诉讼
You filed criminal charges against my client?

675
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,090
你说的没错
You're damn right we did.

676
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,890
她伪造了一张驾照
She forged a fake driver's license

677
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,410
关联了她的W2报税表
and attached it to her w2.

678
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,030
-这可是十年的税收欺诈  -你这个混蛋
- That's ten years of tax fraud. - Oh, you piece of shit.

679
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,750
就算是你  这么做也太过分了
This is crossing the line even for you.

680
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,520
我怎么了
For me?

681
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,090
从我认识你的那天起  你的所作所为
Ever since the day I met you, all you've done is cross lines,

682
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,280
才真的过分  先是剥削癌症患者的钱
and it started with you ripping off cancer victims,

683
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,890
后来的事就更别提了
not to mention every other thing you've ever done.

684
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,260
我告诉过你  我不再是以前那个我了
Hey, I told you I am not that guy anymore.

685
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,740
没错  说完转头就拿狗屁性骚扰
Yeah, right before you tried to ruin my client's life

686
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,580
起诉我的委托人  想毁了他的生活
with some bullshit sexual harassment charge.

687
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,070
那是因为他断了我的委托人的生路
Right after he padlocked my client's livelihood.

688
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,400
没错  他是这么做了
Yeah, you're damn right he did!

689
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,550
-哈维  -每次你跟我对着干
- Harvey-- - Because if you're on a case against me,

690
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,600
伤害到我在乎的人
it's just a matter of time

691
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,540
就只是时间问题
until you eviscerate someone I care about.

692
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,220
伤害
Eviscerate?

693
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,260
如果我想伤害你在乎的人
If I was gonna eviscerate someone you cared about,

694
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,320
我只要点明
all I'd have to do is point out

695
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,570
为什么唐娜不再替你干活了
how Donna's no longer working for you.

696
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,460
离开这里  坦纳  
Hey, get out of here, Tanner.

697
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,440
她现在替路易・利特做事
She's working for Louis Litt.

698
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,990
-你刚才跟我说什么  -你听得很清楚
- What did you just say to me? - You heard me.

699
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,560
然后就上去问她  "红发妞  怎么回事
And then I'd go up to her and say, "What happened, Red?

700
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,890
"是不是哈维厌倦和你上床了
"Did harvey get tired of banging you?

701
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,850
"还是他的功夫实在太差了  你抛弃了他
"Or was he such a lousy lay that you left him

702
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,420
"随便在街上找了一个男人  就像他妈妈
"for the guy down the road just like Harvey's mom

703
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,820
"对待他亲爱的老爹一样"
"did to dear, old dad?"

704
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,810
哈维  哈维  快住手
Harvey! Harvey! Stop!

705
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,120
坦纳  赶紧滚
Tanner, get out of here now!

706
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,250
滚
Go!

707
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,850
你就绝对肯定
You're absolutely convinced

708
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,620
坦纳说的不是实话吗
Tanner couldn't be telling the truth?

709
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,000
这有什么关系吗
What does it matter?

710
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,120
你很可能会毁掉这个女人的一生
Well, you could be ruining this woman's life.

711
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,660
那不是我的问题
That's not my problem.

712
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,410
所以你不相信给人第二次机会吗
So you don't believe in second chances?

713
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,290
我可没这么说
I didn't say that.

714
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,360
是没有  你只是说
No, you just said

715
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,630
一个你不信任的人发誓说他已经改过自新了
a man you didn't trust swore he changed.

716
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,510
然后你不仅没有给他第二次机会来证明这一点
And instead of giving him a chance to prove that,

717
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,790
还对他全面开战
you launched an all-out war.

718
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,620
你到底有没有在听我讲的故事
Were you listening to my goddamn story?

719
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,780
你没听到他说的话吗
Did you hear what he said?

720
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,960
那根本不是一个改过自新的人
That is not a man that's changed.

721
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,680
不  我说的是你的所作所为
No, I'm talking about what you did.

722
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,320
是你挑起了一场全面战争
You launched an all-out war.

723
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,550
我那样做是为了我的委托人
I did that for my client.

724
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,640
而且顺便告诉你
And for your information,

725
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,060
我给过很多人第二次机会
I've given plenty of people second chances.

726
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,050
-比如说谁  -比如  路易
- Like who? - Louis, for one.

727
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,190
迈克
Mike.

728
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,460
唐娜  斯科特
Donna, Scottie,

729
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,190
我弟弟  我...
My brother, my...

730
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,640
你的什么人
Your what?

731
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,650
我以为我们在谈这个案子
I thought we were talking about the case.

732
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,750
我们是从谈论你的梦开始的
We started by talking about your dream.

733
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,470
对  我因为这个案子才做的那个梦
Yeah, the one I had because of my case.

734
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,700
而你说你梦里的那个女人
Mm-hmm. And you said the woman in that dream

735
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,510
不是唐娜
wasn't Donna.

736
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,300
但这讲不通  因为那个男人是坦纳
But it doesn't add up, because the man was Tanner

737
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,490
而你刚刚告诉我你做梦那天
and you just told me what he said about her the same day

738
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,590
他是怎么说她的
that you had that dream.

739
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,010
好吧  我不在乎讲不讲得通
Yeah, well, I don't care if it doesn't add up

740
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,210
因为我说的是实话
because I'm telling the truth.

741
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,670
可你浑身上下都露出马脚说你在撒谎
And yet you have tells all over you that say otherwise.

742
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,000
那你根本不懂什么是马脚
Then you don't know what a tell is,

743
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,770
因为我从不露马脚
because I don't have any.

744
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,400
那好啊
All right.

745
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,430
我们来看看到底谁知道马脚是什么
We'll see who knows what a tell is.

746
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,350
你要和我打牌吗
You want to play poker with me?

747
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,580
是的
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

748
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,780
我要和你打牌
I'm gonna play poker with you.

749
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,600
等我把你的钱都赢光以后
And when I win, and you're out of money,

750
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,490
你要和我说实话
You're gonna tell me the truth.

751
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,100
那要是我把你的钱全赢光  我能得到什么
And what do I get when you're out of money?

752
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,850
无所谓  因为你不可能赢
It doesn't matter 'cause it's never gonna happen.

753
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,740
有件事我得和你谈谈
I need to talk to you about something.

754
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,990
-怎么了  -特拉维斯・坦纳刚给我打电话
- What's going on? - I just got a call from Travis Tanner.

755
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,650
想让我半个小时后和他见面
He wants me to meet him in half an hour.

756
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,490
这事你得告诉哈维
Well, you have to tell Harvey.

757
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,550
我给他留了两条信息了
I left him two messages.

758
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,430
他还没回复我  而就算他回我
He hasn't gotten back to me, but even if he does,

759
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,600
也肯定会告诉我不要去
he's gonna tell me not to go.

760
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,150
那就别去
Well, then don't go.

761
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,230
你不能背着哈维做事啊
You can't go behind Harvey's back.

762
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,970
这就是问题所在
That's the thing.

763
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,830
如果去见坦纳其实是在帮哈维呢
What if going to see Tanner is more like having Harvey's back?

764
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,000
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

765
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,480
我们这个案子对方的委托人
The client on the other side of our case

766
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,460
十年前做过一张假身份证明
made a fake ID ten years ago

767
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,780
结果现在哈维准备为此把她送进监狱
and now Harvey's ready to send her to prison for it,

768
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,560
而且他这样做完全是为了对付坦纳
and he's only doing it because of Tanner.

769
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,830
好吧  但那终归还应该由哈维来决定
Okay, but it's still Harvey's call.

770
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,230
如果他以现在的精神状态作出这个决定
And if he makes that call in his current state of mind,

771
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,220
他可能会后悔终身
he might regret it for the rest of his life.

772
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,640
你说他现在的精神状态是什么意思
What do you mean, his current state of mind?

773
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,700
几周前  我走进哈维的办公室
A couple of weeks ago, I walked into Harvey's office

774
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,910
他正恐慌症发作
and he was having a panic attack.

775
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,980
天呐
Oh, my God.

776
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,540
那个再加上昨天
And on top of that, yesterday,

777
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,150
他们两个大吵起来
the two of them got into a yelling match

778
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,510
最后发展到哈维给了坦纳一拳
that ended with Harvey punching Tanner.

779
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,740
好吧
Okay, look.

780
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,460
你需要做什么就去做吧
Do whatever you have to do.

781
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,350
帮助哈维
Have Harvey's back.

782
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,400
他在哪
Where is he?

783
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,690
-我不知道  -你不知道才有鬼了
- I don't know. - Bullshit, you don't know.

784
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,330
杰西卡  我发誓昨晚之后我再没见过他
Jessica, I swear I haven't seen him since last night.

785
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,210
那我需要知道  他是不是对我撒谎了
Then I need to know, did he lie to me?

786
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,360
唐娜  我一直都信任你
Donna... I've always trusted you.

787
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,300
现在我需要你信任我
Now I need you to trust me.

788
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,350
他是不是做了什么见不得人的勾当去骗杰克
Did he do some underhanded shit to fool Jack

789
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,770
结果自食其果了
and it backfired?

790
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,380
是的
Yes.

791
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,600
你说的一点不差
That's exactly what he did.

792
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,810
那就找到他
Then find him.

793
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,540
让他来见我
And tell him to come see me.

794
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,350
我还能说什么  三张K一对六
What can I say? Kings full of 6s.

795
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,760
好吧  哈维  你赢了
All right, Harvey, you won.

796
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,960
你想怎么样
What do you want?

797
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,360
我就不能先洋洋得意一会儿吗
Can't I take a minute to enjoy my win?

798
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,560
你可以
You can.

799
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,090
但一旦治疗时间结束  我就不接受许愿了哦
But once our time's up, I'm done granting wishes.

800
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,320
既然这样  我想让你告诉我
Well, in that case, I want you to tell me

801
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,770
你作为心理医生犯的最严重的一次错误是什么
the worst mistake you ever made as a therapist.

802
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,710
我们之前可没约定这个
That wasn't part of the deal.

803
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,960
确实没有
No, no, no, no.

804
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,610
你根本没和我做约定  因为你以为
You didn't make a deal with me because you were so sure

805
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,820
你肯定可以打败我
you were gonna beat me.

806
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,440
结果你没赢  所以就该愿赌服输
Well, you didn't, and it's time to pay the piper.

807
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,380
我不会那样做的
Well, I'm not going to do it.

808
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,180
看看现在是谁在逃避了
Look who's deflecting now.

809
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,550
我明白  好吗
Look, I get it, okay?

810
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,820
你来是因为你的恐惧影响到了你的工作
You're here because your fears are affecting your work,

811
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,980
然后现在你想要知道一次我的工作失败经历
and now you're trying to find a time where I failed at my job

812
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,150
这样你就能拿我撒气了
so that you can lash out at me.

813
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,730
我是不会让你那样做的
And I'm not gonna let you do it.

814
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,930
不  我只是想让你体会到
No, I just want you to know

815
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,150
我在这里和你说话的感受
what it feels like to be me in here with you,

816
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,570
如果你不愿意这样做
and if you're not willing to do that,

817
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,290
那你到底还有什么用
then what the hell good are you?

818
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,300
我害死了一个人
I killed someone.

819
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,790
什么
What?

820
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,820
我经常作为专家证人
I do a lot of work as an expert witness

821
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,570
为他人的心智状态做鉴定
in corporate competency situations.

822
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,260
-你是说滥用药物  -是的
- You mean substance abuse? - Yes.

823
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,110
一般这种事都是上位者
And usually it's high-powered people

824
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,980
想保住自己的职位
looking to keep their jobs.

825
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,110
但这次不一样
But this time it was different.

826
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,100
一个客户需要人把他儿子从戒毒所弄出来
A client needed someone to get his son out of rehab

827
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,280
好让他去参加他妈妈的葬礼
so that he could attend his mother's funeral.

828
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,200
我知道牵扯其中已经很不对
I knew it was a mistake to even get involved

829
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,840
因为他愿望太强烈了  而且又是长期客户
because he wanted it so badly, but he was a long-time client

830
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,520
而我很关心他  所以就做了
and I cared about him, so I did it.

831
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,690
我给他儿子做了评估
I evaluated his son.

832
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,510
我知道  内心深处知道他还没准备好
And I knew--I knew deep down inside he wasn't ready,

833
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,230
但依然给他放行了
but I gave the go-ahead anyway,

834
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,970
就在葬礼当晚
and the night of the funeral,

835
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,060
他吸毒过量致死
he overdosed and died.

836
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,570
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

837
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,560
我不希望你感到遗憾
Well, I don't want you to be sorry.

838
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,660
我希望你好好坐下来  跟我说实话
I want you to sit your ass down and tell me the truth

839
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,680
讲出你的梦
about the dream.

840
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,780
我跟你说过  我说的是实话
I told you before. I'm telling you the truth.

841
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,380
我不知道那女人是谁
I don't know who this woman was.

842
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,900
我刚刚跟你打开心扉
You know what, I just opened myself up to you

843
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,040
让你看到我理解你的感觉
to show you that I know what it's like to be you,

844
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,250
可其实我不理解
but I don't.

845
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,560
因为我知道跟自己的内心和谐相处的唯一办法
Because I know that the only way to come to terms

846
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,780
就是把心事说出来
with what's inside is to let it out.

847
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,750
而在你明白这一点之前
And until you figure that out,

848
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,730
你不如还是走吧
you might as well get the hell out

849
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,560
因为你在浪费我俩的时间
because you're wasting both our time.

850
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,750
我记得你以前骑自行车
I remember when you used to ride a bike.

851
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,830
我记得你以前是个卑鄙小人
I remember when you used to be a scumbag

852
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,730
但不会假装自己不是
but you didn't pretend you weren't.

853
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,760
叫我来这儿干嘛  坦纳
Why am I here, Tanner?

854
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,850
我希望你重新考虑我们的和解提议
I want you to reconsider our settlement offer.

855
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,840
你怎么会觉得
And what makes you think

856
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,840
我们愿意接受
we're going to accept the same deal

857
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,870
你们之前开的条件的
that you brought us before?

858
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,310
因为我曾跟你面对面坐着
Because I've sat across from you,

859
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,420
我知道你有比单纯争斗更关心的事
and I know that you care about more than just the fight.

860
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,020
抱歉  但是我们的争斗
Well, I'm sorry, but that fight's gonna end

861
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,150
会以阿丽莎・兰入狱为结束
with Alyssa Lang going to prison.

862
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,690
是  但不必是这样
Yeah, but it doesn't have to.

863
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,760
唯一要那样结束的理由
And the only reason it's gonna end that way

864
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,790
是因为条件是我开的
is because that deal is coming from me.

865
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,120
我要怎么相信你说的话呢
How the hell am I supposed to believe a word you say?

866
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,980
你想让我说什么
What do you want me to say, huh?

867
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,190
说我受够扮演坏人了吗
That I got tired of playing the goon?

868
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,470
我确实受够了
Because I did.

869
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,530
我某天早晨醒来  跟自己说
Yeah, I woke up one morning and I said,

870
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,880
"到此为止了"
"Enough is enough."

871
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,290
那之后我没有接过一件我不相信的案子
And I haven't taken one case that I don't believe in

872
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,910
也没做过一件自己不能接受的事
or done anything that I couldn't stomach since.

873
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,900
听我说  迈克
Look, mike.

874
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,920
我没有别的证据支持了
I don't have a leg to stand on.

875
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,790
也没有其他办法  但你可以说服哈维
I don't have another move, but you can convince Harvey

876
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,750
让他说服彼得罗夫不要毁掉这姑娘的人生
to convince Petroff not to destroy this girl's life.

877
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,770
你只需要觉得你是不是愿意那样
You just need to decide if you're willing to do that, man.

878
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,280
特拉维斯  你一直说哈维不愿意接受和解
Travis, you keep saying that Harvey won't take the deal

879
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,920
是因为有你在
because your name's on it.

880
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,040
可如果你真的改变了
But if you really are a changed man,

881
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,810
也许这是你证明这点的时候了
maybe it's time you prove it.

882
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,370
你可不是墨粉盒
Oh. Hey, you're not toner.

883
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,030
唐娜  拜托  别理我
Donna, please, leave me alone.

884
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,440
路易  你不能一辈子躲在这里
Louis, you can't hide in here forever.

885
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,980
我必须躲  因为我跟哈维保证过
I have to because I made a promise to Harvey,

886
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,400
可我不仅出了错  还把事情搞得一塌糊涂
and not only did I drop the ball, I shit the bed.

887
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,570
而在那之后  我还跟杰西卡说谎
And on top of that, I lied to Jessica telling her

888
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,520
说我不会再帮杰克玩任何阴谋
that I wouldn't be doing any more underhanded shit with Jack.

889
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,540
她知道你做了什么
Well, she knows what you did.

890
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,460
现在该去直面后果了
And it's time to face the music.

891
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,530
你没听我说吗
Oh, did you not just hear me?

892
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,840
我违抗了直接命令
I defied a direct order.

893
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,970
我承认那个  还不如跟她说
I admit that, I might as well tell her

894
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,950
一开始就是我
that I put Harvey's salary in the copy machine

895
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,230
把哈维的薪资单放在复印机里的
in the first place.

896
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,830
也许你应该说
You know what, maybe you should.

897
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,550
太搞笑了  你疯了吗
That's really hilarious. What, are you crazy?

898
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,710
不  路易  我没疯
No, Louis, I'm not.

899
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,210
你做了一个接一个的错误决定
You keep making bad decision after bad decision.

900
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,760
而这是你清除它们的机会
And this is a chance to wipe them all clean.

901
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,070
这没法清除任何东西
It's not gonna wipe anything clean.

902
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,670
只能让我被炒掉
All it's gonna do is get me fired.

903
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,360
是  也许会
Yeah, maybe it will.

904
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,680
但我知道你已经失去杰西卡的信任了
The one thing I do know is you've lost Jessica's trust.

905
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,790
这样做至少给了你一个机会争取回来
This at least gives you a chance to get it back.

906
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,420
那比缩在这里可好多了
It's a hell of a lot better than cowering in here.

907
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,660
怎么了  路易
What is it, Louis?

908
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,100
我来跟你说真相的
I'm here to tell you the truth.

909
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,790
说你之前说不会再帮杰克玩阴谋
That you lied when you said you weren't going

910
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,090
是在说谎吗
to do anything underhanded with Jack?

911
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,470
是我把哈维的薪资单
That I was the one that left Harvey's salary

912
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:37,400
放在复印机里的  故意的
in the copy machine... on purpose.

913
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,830
你为什么不说话
Why aren't you saying anything?

914
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,850
因为我还没决定好要怎么做
Because I haven't decided what I'm going to do.

915
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,620
但你要做的是...
But what you're going to do...

916
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,170
叫该死的杰克・索罗夫上来
is get Jack goddamn Soloff up here.

917
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,090
-你想见我  -是的
- You wanted to see me? - Yes, I did.

918
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,290
路易跟我说了点事
Louis has brought something to my attention.

919
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,280
什么事
And what is that?

920
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,020
根据律所章程C35节
Well, according to subsection C35 of the bylaws,

921
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,160
我们修改薪酬计算方法时
we broke protocol when we changed

922
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:20,940
违规了
the compensation formula.

923
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,800
胡说  根本没什么C35节
Bullshit. There is no subsection C35.

924
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,940
你错了
You're wrong.

925
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,140
-在这儿  你自己看  -我不用看
- Here, take a look. - I don't need to look.

926
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,520
如果你是在要求我把这话说给合伙人们
And if you're asking me to sell this to the partners,

927
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,680
那你运气不太好  我不会同意的
You're shit out of luck.

928
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,740
不  是你运气不太好
No, you're shit out of luck.

929
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,360
因为路易不仅拿了律所章程给我看
Because Louis didn't just come to me with the bylaws.

930
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,820
还承认了就是你
He admitted that it was you

931
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,680
故意把哈维的薪资单传出去
who deliberately put Harvey's salary out there

932
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,340
让所有人看到的
for all the world to see.

933
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,160
对吧  路易
Isn't that right, Louis?

934
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,490
对...不起  杰克
I...am sorry, Jack.

935
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,160
我必须得说实话
I had to come clean.

936
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,290
-那才是对的事  -你这个谎话连篇的家伙
- It was the right thing to do. - You lying piece of shit.

937
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,730
注意点  杰克
Watch it, Jack.

938
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,120
你是在跟冠名合伙人说话呢
You're talking to a name partner.

939
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,970
而且你说他说谎
And you're saying that he's lying,

940
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,380
但作为薪金委员会的领导
but as head of the compensation committee,

941
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,170
你完全可以查哈维的薪金
you had access to Harvey's salary.

942
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,320
不是我泄露的那份文件  我可以证明
I didn't leave that document out and I can prove it.

943
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,500
-怎么证明  -我知道的真实情况是...
- How is that? - I know for a fact that--

944
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,820
我来帮你说吧
Oh, let me help you out.

945
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,490
你之所以住口
The reason you stopped yourself

946
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,920
是因为你本打算说是路易泄露的
is that you were going to say Louis left it out.

947
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,450
但如果你早就知道  却没有提出来
But if you knew that, and still didn't come forward,

948
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,650
那我也可以因此而开了你
then I can fire your ass for that, too.

949
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,450
但你不会那样做
But you're not going to do that

950
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,490
因为这样你也得炒了他
because you'd also have to fire him.

951
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,650
可你经不起再搞一次人事变动了
And you can't afford another shake-up.

952
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,410
你说得对  我经不起了
You're right. I can't.

953
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,650
但我不在乎  因为我宁愿炒了你俩
But I don't care, because I'd rather fire you both

954
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,820
也不想让你摆布我
than to let you push me around.

955
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,260
这取决于你  杰克
So it's up to you, Jack.

956
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,780
要么支持C35条款
Stand by provision C35...

957
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,770
要么就滚蛋
or pack up your shit.

958
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,400
原谅我  杰西卡  你说得对
Forgive me, Jessica, you're right.

959
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,590
下次我会更仔细地阅读公司章程
Next time I'll read the bylaws more carefully.

960
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,090
从一开始  你就知道
You knew this whole thing would play out this way

961
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,590
结果会这样  对吗
the second it started, right?

962
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,110
我很清楚
I had a pretty good idea.

963
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,270
杰西卡...
Jessica...

964
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,960
我什么时候才能明白不能违背你
When am I gonna learn not to defy you?

965
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,460
你永远不会明白的
You're never going to learn.

966
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,430
但只要我清楚那点  我们就没事
But as long as I know that, we'll be okay.

967
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,690
我...
I--

968
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,740
今晚想去泥浴吗
Feel like going mudding tonight?

969
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,920
-不想  -我猜到了
- No. - I figured.

970
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,200
你最好是来告诉我  坦纳放弃了
You better be here to tell me Tanner's walking away.

971
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,770
我是来告诉你  我今天跟他见面了
I'm here to tell you that I met with him today.

972
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,520
你没告诉我就去见他了吗
You went to see him without telling me?

973
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,560
-我给你留了两条信息  -那又怎么样
- I left you two messages. - So the hell what?

974
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,790
我的案子你不能背着我去偷偷见人
You don't cut me out of a meeting on my case.

975
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,970
你的案子
Your case?

976
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,080
坦纳为你的案子提出了一个和解协议
Well, Tanner's made a settlement offer on your case,

977
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,420
我觉得我们应该接受
and I think that we should take it.

978
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,270
你开玩笑吗  我们捏着他的命门呢
Are you kidding? We have a boot to his throat.

979
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,480
我们没必要和解
We don't have to settle.

980
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,390
我们只要决定要用多大力气捏就行了
All we have to do is decide how hard to press.

981
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,710
你捏的不是他的命门
You're not pressing on his throat,

982
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,750
而是阿丽莎・兰的命门
you're pressing on Alyssa Lang's.

983
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,110
所以他只需要大声说他已经变了
So all he has to do is claim that he's a changed man

984
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,560
你就会背弃我去支持他吗
and you take his side over mine?

985
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,360
我没有支持他
I'm not on his side.

986
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,100
我们的客户不费吹灰之力就能借这个创意
Our client stands to make a fortune from this deal

987
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,050
-赚一大笔钱  -我才不管
- without lifting a finger. - I don't give a shit.

988
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,750
你看到他做了什么  也听到他是怎么说的
You saw what he did, and you heard what he said.

989
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,180
我们接手这件案子时
And you said when we started this,

990
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,290
你就说这又会像以前一样  但现在
it would be just like old times, but right now,

991
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,170
表现得像坏人的是你  而不是他
you're acting like the bad guy, not him.

992
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,990
那个烂人根本没变
That piece of shit hasn't changed

993
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,400
我不会跟他和解的
and I'm not settling with him.

994
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,840
我不是让你跟他和解
And I'm not asking you to.

995
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,000
这是什么
What the hell is that?

996
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,420
是原始协议
It's the original offer.

997
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,390
只是现在的律师是卡特里娜・班尼特
Only now the attorney of record is Katrina Bennet.

998
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,310
我让坦纳放弃这个案子
I had Tanner remove himself from the case,

999
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,260
现在你不是跟他和解
so now you're not settling with him.

1000
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,490
而只是做了对大家都好的事情
You're just doing what's best for everyone.

1001
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,710
接受协议
Take the deal.

1002
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,160
你真的不想先读一读吗
You sure you don't want to read it first?

1003
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,550
没这个必要
I don't have to.

1004
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,510
{\an8}泥浴俱乐部  晚十点
唐娜

1005
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,230
瑞秋  我现在没空聊
Rachel, I cannot talk right now.

1006
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,330
我要跟唐娜泥浴去了
I'm going mudding with Donna.

1007
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,860
不  路易  你是要和我们俩一起去泥浴
No, Louis, you're going mudding with both of us.

1008
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,820
路易
Louis?

1009
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,310
我必须承认
I have to say,

1010
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,880
我很意外你又预约来了
I'm surprised you called for another appointment.

1011
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,580
还能说什么呢
What can I say?

1012
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,750
你给我讲的那个故事打动了我
You telling me that story got to me.

1013
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,440
所以你准备好说实话了吗
So you're ready to tell the truth?

1014
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,450
准备好了
I am.

1015
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,900
出现在我梦中的女人是唐娜
The woman in my dream was Donna.

1016
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,800
我很高兴你回来跟我说这件事
Well, I'm glad you came back to talk about it.

1017
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,000
既然你已对我敞开了心扉
And since you've opened up to me,

1018
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,700
我也会对你敞开心扉
I'm going to open up to you.

1019
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,230
我相信你说的是实话
I believe you're telling the truth.

1020
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,770
-这就是敞开心扉吗  -不  这个才是
- That's opening up? - No, this is.

1021
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,530
我相信你说的是实话
I believe you're telling the truth,

1022
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,800
但我觉得你梦中的女人
But I don't think the woman

1023
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,660
其实并不是唐娜
in your dream was actually Donna.

1024
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,940
我觉得是你母亲
I think it was your mother.

1025
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,370
真是难以相信
I don't believe it.

1026
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:28,000
我把困扰了我好几天的事情告诉了你
I tell you the thing that's been eating at me for days,

1027
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,320
你却说我撒谎吗
and you're calling me a liar?

1028
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,080
不  我不是说你撒谎
No, I'm not calling you a liar.

1029
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,770
你的梦是一系列未决问题的结合重演
Your dream was a representation of unresolved issues.

1030
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,190
唯一的未决问题是我向你吐露心声
The only unresolved issue is I opened up

1031
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,400
你却来激怒我
and you're turning on me.

1032
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,320
哈维  提你母亲不是攻击你
Harvey, bringing up your mother isn't turning on you.

1033
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,720
你完全不了解提我母亲对我意味着什么
You have no idea what bringing up my mother is to me!

1034
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,800
我不了解  但那正是我们现在所做一切的意义
No, I don't. That's the whole point of what we're doing here.

1035
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,200
我们现在做什么都不重要了  因为我们结束了
It doesn't matter what we're doing here 'cause we're done.

1036
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,620
哈维  哈维
Harvey, Harvey, look.

1037
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,170
我不在乎你挣多少钱
I don't care how much money you make

1038
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,040
睡过多少女人
or how many women you sleep with.

1039
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,040
你生命中有一些问题会导致你
You have issues in your life that will keep you

1040
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,760
难以获得真正的爱情
from having real relationships.

1041
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,890
你尽可以跟自己说
And you can tell yourself all you want

1042
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,600
这一切与你的母亲毫无干系
that it has nothing to do with your mother,

1043
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,620
但那是自欺欺人  你自己也清楚
but it's a lie and you know it.

1044
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,610
我说过了  我们结束了
Well, like I said, we're done.
