{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on Suits

22
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,580
-你想什么呢  -就是在想名字
- What you thinking about? - Just thinking about names.

23
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,910
如果我要一起养他
It's just that if I'm gonna help raise him,

24
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,820
我想给他点什么
I'd like to give him something.

25
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,700
他会跟你的姓
You're gonna be the one who gave him his last name.

26
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,100
但之后我的小儿子  他得了哮喘
My little guy--he got asthma.

27
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,750
客厅的窗户
The window in the living room--

28
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,320
已经坏了七个月了
it's been broken for seven months.

29
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,380
他的当事人欠了三个月房租
His client hasn't paid her rent in three months.

30
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,940
整个冬天房子都没暖气  还有扇窗户坏了
She's had no heat, and a broken window all winter

31
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,660
虽然她已经反复要求修理了
despite repeated requests for repair.

32
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,990
她的要求从未写在纸面上
We don't have it in writing,

33
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,090
而法庭要求的  就是纸面记录
which is what the court requires.

34
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,230
我请求一点时间与我上司协商
I'd like to request time to confer with my supervisor.

35
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,740
-你得帮他  -我做不到
- You have to help him. - I can't.

36
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,890
我们申请  如果明早十点没有收到支票
We are requesting permission to evict

37
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,420
则法庭允许将其驱逐
if we don't have a check by 10:00 a.M. tomorrow.

38
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,070
三千六百美金
$3,600.

39
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,180
应该够支付你近三个月的房租了
Should be enough to cover your rent for the last three months.

40
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,240
我不知道说什么了
I don't what to say.

41
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,430
-这是工作邀约  -等你毕业
- This is a job offer. When you graduate,

42
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,580
你得在通过品行考核
you're gonna have to pass the Character of Fitness test.

43
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,330
你觉得去你的律所工作
And you think working at your firm

44
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,170
比去我的律所工作更体面
looks better than working at mine.

45
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,000
你是想说哈维让我帮你
You're gonna tell me you had nothing to do

46
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,160
拿律师执照和你一点关系都没有吗
with Harvey asking me to help you get a law license.

47
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,960
她之前都没注意到我
I wasn't even on her radar.

48
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,820
我只想做一件事情  你却毁了它
I had one thing I wanted to do, and you ruined it for me,

49
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,330
只是因为你无法接受
just because you can't accept the fact

50
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,190
我不想回到你这里工作的事实
that I don't wanna come back here.

51
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,420
我并没想让你回来
I wasn't trying to get you back.

52
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,170
-我只是想帮你  -我不相信
- I was trying to help you. - I don't believe you.

53
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,000
别再来打扰我的生活
Stop messing with my life!

54
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,670
迈克  你怎么来了
Mike, what are you doing here?

55
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,130
我来为吼你去找吉布斯的事道歉
I came to apologize for yelling at you about going to Gibbs.

56
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,430
-没这必要的  -有必要
- You don't have to do that. - Yes, I do.

57
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,680
我知道你都是为我好
I know you only had my best interest at heart.

58
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,390
你一向如此
You always do, and...

59
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,970
我不该冲你发火的
I shouldn't have snapped at you.

60
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,050
我不该背着你去找她的
I shouldn't have gone to her behind your back.

61
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,210
没事
That's okay.

62
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,760
结果还不错
It kinda worked out.

63
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,420
进来  我们喝一杯
Come on in. Let's have a drink.

64
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,310
你跟我说说
You can tell me all about it.

65
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,560
开玩笑  法律诊所
You kidding me? A legal clinic?

66
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,680
吉布斯不是说
I thought Gibbs told you

67
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,870
她绝不会允许的吗
she'd never let that happen.

68
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,550
是啊  她会告诉人们我是骗子
Yeah, by telling people I was a fraud.

69
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,490
但唯一多年前就知道
Turns out the one guy who knew I was a fraud

70
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,220
我是骗子的人开了家诊所
from years ago runs the clinic.

71
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,780
他不仅愿意雇我
Not only was he willing to hire me,

72
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,190
还对此非常开心
he was happy about it.

73
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,130
看来犯罪真有回报
Seems like crime does pay.

74
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,520
当然了
You bet your ass it does.

75
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,050
-怎么  -你不会相信的
- What? - You're never gonna believe it,

76
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,570
但他们让我监督一个三年级的法律学生
but they have me supervising this third-year law student.

77
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,920
她觉得自己比我牛
She thinks she knows more than me.

78
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,450
-你是说你身边有个你  -她比我糟多了
- You mean you have a you. - She is so much worse than me.

79
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,640
她是不是老是提
Is she constantly talking about

80
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,130
自己的记忆力有多好
what a great memory she has?

81
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,220
衣着品味差  拿男人的包包
Dresses shitty? She have man purse?

82
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,340
说够没
Are you done?

83
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,780
怎么  你还急着去哪吗
Why? You have someplace you gotta be?

84
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,270
其实  我这会儿还不能
Actually, I am supposed to stay away

85
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,690
回我们的公寓
from our apartment for awhile.

86
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,900
总之  我对路易说"我不管
So anyway, I said to Louis, "I don't care

87
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,130
大部分律师是不是从大办公室起步
if most of the associates start in the bullpen.

88
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,660
我不会放弃我的办公室"
I'm not giving up my office."

89
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,840
太棒了  瑞秋  但这都第三杯夏敦埃葡萄酒了
That's great, Rachel, but I'm on my third glass of Chardonnay,

90
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,250
我想你叫我过来应该不是
and I don't think you called me over here

91
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,420
为了告诉我你提交了资格认证申请
to tell me you submitted your application to the Bar,

92
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,290
或是你对路易表明了态度吧
or that you're putting your foot down with Louis.

93
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,570
没错
You're right.

94
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,510
我叫你过来是为了告诉你
I called you over here to tell you that...

95
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,660
我对迈克表明了态度
I put my foot down with Mike.

96
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,810
你终于叫他选好一种发型别变来变去了吗
You finally told him to pick a hairstyle and stick with it?

97
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,140
不是
No.

98
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,240
我终于告诉他
I finally told him

99
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,560
他走之前曾对我做出了一个承诺
that he made me a promise before he went away,

100
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,980
现在他回来了
and now that he's back

101
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,170
又找到了挣钱的工作
and gainfully employed,

102
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,150
是时候该给我个名分了
it's time for him to make an honest woman of me.

103
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,070
瑞秋  我好为你高兴
Rachel, I'm so happy for you.

104
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,210
答案是好
And the answer's yes.

105
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,970
什么答案
What answer?

106
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,880
-我还没问你什么呢  -你问了
- I didn't ask you a question yet. - Yes, you did,

107
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,070
而且我很乐意做你的伴娘
and I'd be thrilled to be your maid of honor.

108
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,170
谢谢  唐娜
Thank you, Donna.

109
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,420
迈克  太棒了
Mike, that's great.

110
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,340
我为你高兴
I'm happy for you.

111
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,400
你还想做我的伴郎吗
Still up for being my best man?

112
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,890
绝不会错过
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

113
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,450
我们还去教堂吗
We going back to the church?

114
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,130
不  这次我们要在家里办
No, we're gonna do it at our place this time.

115
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,650
不  那不行
No, you can't do that.

116
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,980
我想要个小型  亲密的仪式
Yeah, we just wanna keep it small, intimate.

117
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,730
我理解  但我不提出让你在这儿办
I understand, but what kinda best man would I be

118
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,450
还算哪门子好伴郎啊
if I didn't offer for you to have it here?

119
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,120
要我说  你不提就真的很不好了
Pretty shitty one if you ask me.

120
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,590
所以  你来道歉
So basically you came here to apologize,

121
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,620
是为了不用在你的
so you didn't have to get married

122
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,190
小破烂公寓里结婚
at your shitty little apartment.

123
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,920
你觉得如果我们有更好的地点
You think that I'd ask you to be my best man

124
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,700
我还会找你做伴郎吗
if we had a better location?

125
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,240
恭喜
Congratulations. 

126
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,970
谢谢  哈维
Thanks, Harvey.

127
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,390
现在我们只需要确保
Now all we need to do is make sure

128
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,780
-你这次不会逃婚  -有意思
- you don't skip out on this one. - Yeah, it's funny.

129
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,480
我们还得确保你不会在婚礼上...
We also need to make sure that you don't--

130
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,650
唐娜
Donna at the wedding.

131
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,880
你说什么
What did you just say? 

132
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,140
你喉咙里卡了什么吗
You got something caught in your throat?

133
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,250
没有  我没事
No, I'm all good.

134
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,240

我们要庆祝
We're celebrating.

137
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,100
路易  你知道我不能喝香槟酒
Louis, you know I can't have champagne.

138
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,190
我知道  所以我们要喝的是
I know, which is why we're having

139
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,240
能买到的最好喝的苹果酒
the best sparkling apple cider money can buy.

140
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,250
那样的话
Well, in that case...

141
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,660
我们庆祝什么
What are we celebrating?

142
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,950
庆祝你这周第一次做B超
The fact that it's your first sonogram this week.

143
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,360
路易  关于B超的事
Louis, about the sonogram...

144
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,720
约书亚问他是否可以来
Joshua asked if he could be there.

145
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,470
-什么  -他是孩子的父亲
- What? - He's the baby's father.

146
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,130
他想参与他的生活
He wants to be in its life.

147
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,520
或是想参与你的生活
Or wants to be in your life.

148
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,300
路易  我选了你没选他
Louis, I chose you over him.

149
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,260
你不用担心这一点
You don't have to be worried about that.

150
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,890
如果你想让我说他不能来
And if you want me to say he can't be there for this,

151
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,140
那我会说的
then I will,

152
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,890
但他问了我  我觉得这要求也算合理
but he asked me, and I thought it was a fair request,

153
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,440
所以我得问问你
so I'm asking you.

154
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,580
好吧  他可以去
Yeah, he can be there.

155
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,110
-你确定吗  -不确定
- Are you sure? - No, I'm not,

156
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,770
但我知道这样做是正确的
but I know it's the right thing to do.

157
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,670
谢谢你
Thank you.

158
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,970
打扰  我需要...
Um, excuse me, I just need to--

159
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,320
你好呀  本杰明
Oh, hello, Benjamin.

160
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,700
你是过来摆弄我的硬盘的吗
Have you come to manipulate my hard drive?

161
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,390
调试我的处理器
Debug my processor?

162
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,020
还是重启我的主板
Reboot my motherboard?

163
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,830
拜托  让我安静的升级一下VOX系统就好
Please, I just need to update your VOX in peace.

164
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,610
假如我想升级我的播放系统
If I wanted my VOX updated,

165
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,420
我会去找一个比你有经验得多的人
I'd be talking to someone with a lot more experience than you.

166
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,220
鲍尔森女士  我知道你清楚这一点
Ms. Paulsen, I know you know this

167
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,450
但我要第37次提醒你...
but I will remind you for the 37th time--

168
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,160
VOX是我们的电脑操作系统
that VOX is our computer's operating system,

169
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,790
一个季度得升级一次
and it needs to be updated once a quarter.

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,000
一个季度才一次吗
Once a quarter?

171
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,960
我俩还没结婚你就这么冷淡了吗
What, are we married?

172
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,860
我得告诉你
'Cause I got news for you.

173
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,360
这台主机需要个新的记忆条
This main frame needs a new memory stick

174
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,030
一季度来一次肯定不够
a hell of a lot more than once a quarter.

175
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,500
好了  完事了
That's it. I'm finished.

176
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,440
我会一步步教你如何硬重启
I would walk you through the hard restart,

177
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,530
但恐怕刚刚那句话里你的关注点全是错的
but I'm afraid you'd focused on all the wrong words in that sentence.

178
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,750
不不  此时此刻
No no, right now

179
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,150
我只关注你"完事了"这一点
I'm just focused on the fact that you're finished.

180
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,470
把钱留在桌子上就好
Now leave your money on the table,

181
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,980
这样我就能看着你离开了
so I can watch you walk away.

182
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,530
介意告诉我刚刚那出是怎么回事吗
Mind telling me what that was all about?

183
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,870
你是指我对我们的技术小哥进行性暗示吗
You mean me making sexually suggestive comments to our IT guy?

184
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,050
人家有名字的  你知道吧
He has a name, you know.

185
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,440
我知道  但我不信你知道
I do, but I'd be shocked if you knew what it was.

186
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,920
那不是重点
That's not the point.

187
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,370
的确  哈维  重点是
No, Harvey, the point is,

188
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,200
我不是对他这么做
I'm not doing anything to him,

189
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,720
而是为他才这么做的
I'm doing it for him.

190
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,770
你又是怎么知道的
And how exactly do you figure that?

191
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,730
我知道
I figure that,

192
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,000
是因为本杰明帮别人升级都是远程操作的
because Benjamin updates everybody else's computers remotely,

193
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,050
但他一个季度会下来一次
and once a quarter he's down here,

194
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,420
假装自己不喜欢我的举动
pretending not to like my act,

195
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,580
所以除非你想要我调转枪口  拿你开涮
so unless you want me to focus my rapier-like wit on you,

196
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,220
不然你还是挪挪你那漂亮的小身子
I suggest you walk your pretty little self

197
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,570
回你的办公室去吧
back into your office.

198
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,680
本杰明  我知道他的名字
Benjamin. I knew it.

199
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,980
不  你不知道
No, you didn't.

200
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,190
迈克  谢天谢地你来了
Mike, thank God you're here.

201
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,470
索菲亚・普莱斯刚刚打电话来了
Sofia Price just called.

202
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,890
她从昨晚到现在一直在医院陪着他儿子
She's been in the hospital since last night with her son.

203
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,730
-他没事吧  -嗯  暂时没事
- Is he okay? - I think so, for now.

204
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,900
是犯了哮喘  她想让我转告你...
It was an asthma attack, but she wanted me to tell you that--

205
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,360
她没办法准时去交房租了
She couldn't drop off the check for her rent.

206
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,540
该死的...
Damn it, um...

207
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,020
打电话给她  告诉她我会去处理
Call her back. Tell her I'm on it.

208
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,180
迈克  等等
Mike, wait.

209
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,910
你用自己的钱帮她还了债  是不是
You covered what she owed with your own money, didn't you?

210
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,330
因为那可是很大一笔钱
Because that's above and beyond.

211
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,960
晚点再赞美我也不迟
We can talk about how awesome I am later.

212
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,040
现在  我得去确保
Right now, I need to make sure that

213
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,820
索菲亚的租金能在十点前交齐
Sofia's rent is paid by 10:00.

214
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,440
路易  我能和你谈谈吗
Louis, can I talk to you?

215
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,160
当然
Of course.

216
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,030
我...我不知道该怎么办
I--I don't even know what to do.

217
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,960
我的手在抖
My hands are shaking.

218
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,200
瑞秋  发生什么事了
Rachel, what's going on?

219
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,570
我不能当律师了
I'm not getting into the Bar.

220
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,180
-什么  太荒唐了  -读读这个
- What? That's ridiculous. - Read this.

221
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,610
经仔细审查您的申请
After careful review of your application,

222
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,650
品行考核委员会
the Character and Fitness committee

223
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,330
决定不予你面试机会
will not be granting you an interview?

224
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,310
这简直扯淡
This is bullshit!

225
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,110
是啊  我知道我肯定是得为自己辩护的
I know, because I knew I was gonna have to defend myself,

226
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,860
但我没想到
but I didn't think

227
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,560
他们甚至不给我为自己辩护的机会
I wasn't even gonna have the chance to defend myself.

228
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,430
-好吧  冷静  -我怎么冷静得了
- Okay, calm down. - How can I calm down?

229
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,220
我爸担心的就是这种情况
This is exactly what my dad was afraid of.

230
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,820
他说过他们会因为我和迈克的关系为难我
He said that they'd hold my relationship with Mike against me.

231
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,290
这不一定是因为迈克
You don't know this is about Mike.

232
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,270
当然是因为迈克  还能...
Of course it's about Mike. What--

233
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,170
还能是因为什么
what else would it be about?

234
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,150
可能是文件出错了
It could be a mix-up,

235
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,610
可能是因为笔误
some kind of clerical error.

236
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,390
可能是你表格没填对
You could've filled out the paperwork wrong.

237
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,430
我检查了十遍
I went over it ten times.

238
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,770
瑞秋  这件事肯定是事出有因的
Rachel, there is an explanation for this,

239
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,670
我会查个清清楚楚
and I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

240
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,510
-你保证不了  -看着我
- You don't know that. - Look at me.

241
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,820
我保证会让你得到面试机会的  好吗
I promise you will get your interview, okay?

242
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,730
好吧
Okay.

243
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,980
哈维  我们遇到麻烦了
Harvey, we have a problem.

244
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,110
怎么了
What is it?

245
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,590
这事和迈克有关
This is about Mike.

246
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,320
当然是和迈克有关了
Of course it's about Mike.

247
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,610
所以瑞秋一离开我办公室我就到这来了
That's why I came here the second Rachel left my office.

248
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,560
你怎么和瑞秋说的
What'd you tell Rachel?

249
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,400
你觉得我会怎么和她说
What do you think I told her?

250
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,980
我告诉她一定是出了什么差错
I told her that it must be some kind of mistake,

251
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,100
但我俩都心知肚明这不是出错
but you and I both knows it's not,

252
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,230
这意味着你得解决这件事
which means you need to fix this.

253
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,410
没错  的确需要我解决这件事
Yeah, I do need to fix it,

254
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,500
我也会解决
and I will.

255
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,030
但一般  你不会来找我
Normally, instead of coming to me,

256
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,620
而会开足马力  一意孤行
you'd go full steam ahead and do something

257
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,670
让情况变得更糟
that makes the situation significantly worse.

258
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,280
有可能  你想表达什么
Possibly. What are you getting at?

259
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,240
你到底为什么来找我
Why did you come to me?

260
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,010
因为我们说过要一起管理这间律所
Because we said we'd run this firm together,

261
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,080
而想要做到这一点
and if we're gonna do that,

262
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,430
那我就得诚实地面对
then I have to be honest with myself

263
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,860
自己的强项和你的强项
of what I'm good at and what you're good at.

264
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,360
而你知道在这种事上我比你在行
And you know I'm better at this kinda thing than you are?

265
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,660
我知道
I do.

266
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,500
路易  这说明你确实成长了
Louis, that shows real growth.

267
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,550
谢谢  哈维  你没有不在乎
Thank you, Harvey. And it shows growth on your part

268
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,270
我刚刚承认的  对我来说
not to make light of the fact that I just admitted

269
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,550
很难承认的事说明
something that was...

270
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,130
你也成长了
very difficult for me to admit.

271
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,130
你是说我在任何方面都比你强这件事吗
You mean that I'm better at everything than you.

272
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,470
-我没有这么说  -真可惜
- That's not what I said. - Too bad,

273
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,810
我就是这么理解的
because that's what I heard.

274
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,340
好吧  哈维  说正事
Okay, Harvey, seriously,

275
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,160
现在不是你拿我开玩笑的时候
this is not about you having fun with me.

276
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,520
事关瑞秋
This is about Rachel.

277
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,300
我知道  如果我对处理这件事
I know it is, and if I weren't confident

278
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,450
不是把握十足
that I could take care of it,

279
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,860
我也不会拿你承认
I wouldn't be giving you a hard time

280
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,410
我在各个方面都比你强这事跟你开玩笑
for admitting how much better I am at everything than you.

281
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,260
妈的
God damn it.

282
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,830
抱歉  路易  我还得去展示我的过人之处
Sorry, Louis, gotta go be better at something.

283
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,100
回见
See you later.

284
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,860
-我有什么能为你效劳的  -是的  你有
- Can I help you? - Yes, you can.

285
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,110
我叫迈克・罗斯
My name's Mike Ross.

286
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,070
我是来代表索菲亚・普莱斯
I'm here on behalf of Sofia Price,

287
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,550
这是她欠你的委托人的所有租金
and this is every dime of rent she owes your client.

288
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,750
为什么要你送来给我呢
And why exactly are you bringing that to me?

289
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,650
你是个律师  不是房东
Because you're an attorney, not a landlord,

290
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,690
我不想有什么误会
and I don't want there to be any misunderstandings.

291
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,790
据我所知现在是10点18分
What I understand is that it's 10:18,

292
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,150
但你的委托人的时限是10点整
and your client had till 10:00.

293
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,390
你在跟我开玩笑吗
You have got to be shitting me.

294
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,140
我很确定不是
I most certainly am not,

295
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,860
也许你的委托人在欠付这么多个月租金前
and maybe your client should have thought of that

296
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,990
就应该想到这种结果
before not paying her rent all those months.

297
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,560
你以为我不知道你们在搞什么鬼吗
You think I don't know what's going on here?

298
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,480
你们想赶她走  然后就可以把这个房子
You're trying to get her out, so that you can get this place out

299
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,380
移出租金控制名单
from under rent control,

300
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,540
但我不会让你得逞的
but I'm not gonna let you get away with it.

301
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,840
不  事实上是
No, what's going on here

302
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,220
我的委托人已经厌倦了这个
is that my client is sick of having a troublemaker,

303
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,660
总是不好好付房租的麻烦精
who doesn't pay her rent, as a tenant.

304
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,860
听我说  你不能现在驱赶她
Listen to me, you cannot evict her now.

305
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,460
她的儿子进医院了
Her son is in the hospital.

306
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,940
这是我的工作
I have a job to do.

307
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,070
好了  关于你委托人的儿子我很抱歉
Now, I am sorry about your client's son,

308
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,390
但法庭上讲的很清楚了
but the court was very clear,

309
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,230
我也做不了什么了
and there's nothing more that I can do.

310
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,320
迈克  怎样了
Mike, what happened?

311
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,820
晚到了18分钟
Got there 18 minutes late.

312
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,740
那有什么关系  你拿着三个月的租金
What does it matter? You had three months back rent.

313
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,800
他们想把她赶出去然后脱离租金控制名单
They wanna kick her out to get out of rent control,

314
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,890
我们错过了时限
and now that we've missed the deadline,

315
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,160
我们就没有办法了
there's nothing we can do about it.

316
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,700
不  有的
Wrong, there is.

317
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,740
我想了一下  他们为什么这么着急
I got to thinking--why would they be in such a hurry

318
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,890
驱赶一个好不容易能付其租金的人
to evict somebody who can actually come up with the money?

319
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,740
他们不仅仅想要把她赶出去
They're not just trying to get her out.

320
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,870
他们是想把每个人都赶出去
They're trying to get everyone out.

321
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,060
正是
Exactly.

322
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,840
他们要拆除整栋建筑
They're gonna demolish that whole building.

323
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,010
我昨天晚上去过  工人们已经就位了
I was over there last night. The workers were already there,

324
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,450
也就是说他们已经开始了
which means they've already started.

325
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,490
懂了  你想反诉他们
I get it. You wanna hit 'em with a countersuit.

326
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,100
我想要跟他们一记重拳
I wanna nail their asses to the wall.

327
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,370
你们两个着手准备诉讼吧
Now you guys get to work on the suit.

328
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,680
我要去和纳森聊聊如何与此同时
I'm gonna go talk to Nathan about stopping Sofia's eviction

329
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,580
-阻止索菲亚被赶出来  -迈克
- from happening in the meantime. - Mike.

330
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,870
你不用去找纳森  我可以处理
You don't need to go to Nathan. I can handle this.

331
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,770
-听着  我很感激  -我理解的
- Listen, I appreciate that-- - I get it.

332
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,640
我那天表现很糟糕
I shit the bed the other day.

333
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,130
-奥利佛  -听着  迈克
- Oliver-- - Look, Mike.

334
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,310
我承认有时我在法庭上会慌乱
I admit, sometimes I get flustered in court.

335
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,530
但本案法律很明确  这很简单
But the law's clear on this. It's a layup.

336
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,400
如果我们有个待决诉讼  那就可以自动
If we have a pending lawsuit, it puts an automatic hold

337
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,480
将驱逐令延期
on the eviction.

338
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,520
我告诉你我能处理这件事
I'm telling you I can handle this.

339
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,570
拜托  让我弥补一下之前的错误吧
Please, let me make up for the other day.

340
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,890
好吧  那你还在等什么
Well, what are you waiting for?

341
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,810
赶紧去法院
Get your ass down to court.

342
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,230
搞定了立刻告诉我
Let me know as soon as it's done.

343
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,450
好了  本杰明  娱乐时间结束了
All right, Benjamin, playtime's over.

344
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,020
你到底对我的电脑做了什么
What the hell did you do to my computer?

345
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,310
我什么也没做
I didn't do anything to it,

346
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,770
只是提升了一下它的性能
other than increase its performance.

347
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,430
如果那能叫提升性能
If that's your idea of increasing performance,

348
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,830
那你真的要好好考虑一下自己的职业生涯了
then you ought to rethink your career,

349
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,320
因为那玩意现在宕机的次数比梅尔・吉布森
because that thing has crashed more times

350
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,940
周六夜场喝高后回家路上的断片次数还多
than Mel Gibson on his way home from a Saturday night.

351
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,470
等等  你是在笑吗
Wait a second, are you smiling?

352
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,740
当然不是  你在冲我发火
Of course not. You're yelling at me.

353
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,580
我怎么会笑
Why would I be smiling?

354
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,170
别拿谎话糊弄谎话精  本杰明
Don't bullshit a bull-shitter, Benjamin.

355
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,550
你肯定有什么目的  你最好现在就坦白
You're up to something, and you better come clean right now.

356
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,800
好吧  我本身想找个
Okay. I was hoping to do this

357
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,790
更加正式的场合这么做  但是
in a more formal environment, but...

358
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,690
请允许我介绍一下  真・唐娜
Allow me to introduce The Donna.

359
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,920
这是什么玩意
What the hell is that?

360
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,590
这是个数字版的你
It's a digital version of you,

361
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,680
存储了约一万条
with approximately 10,000 of your best quotes,

362
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,770
你的名句  俏皮话  和歇后语  
witticisms, and zingers, packed into five gigahertz

363
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,010
共计5个G容量
of computing power.

364
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,410
所以你才会亲自去升级我的电脑
That's why you've been personally updating my computer

365
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,230
别人都是远程升级吗
and nobody else's?

366
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,800
是的  我已经秘密给你录音
Yes, I've been secretly recording you

367
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,870
两年了
for the better part of two years.

368
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,960
两年
Two years?

369
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,280
为什么是我
Why me?

370
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,480
因为每个人都希望
Because everyone always wishes 

371
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,540
能在正确的时间说正确的话
they could say the right thing

372
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,870
而你就是整个宇宙中
at the right time, and you are the one woman

373
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,340
唯一每次都能做到的人
in the universe who says the right thing every time.

374
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,810
更不用说  毫无疑问
Now to mention, you are without a doubt

375
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,120
你是史上
the most amazing legal secretary 

376
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,460
最迷人的法律秘书
in the history of everything.

377
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,280
本杰明  这是我听过的
Benjamin, that's the sweetest thing

378
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,570
最好听的话了
anyone's ever said to me.

379
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,090
好吧  不过你自己两周之前就这么说过
Okay, but you said it about yourself two weeks ago.

380
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,130
-我是这么说过  -所以
- That I did. - In that case,

381
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,100
唐娜・鲍尔森  我本来打算
Donna Paulsen, I wasn't gonna ask you this

382
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,800
过几周再问你这件事  不过你觉得
for another few weeks, but how would you feel about

383
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,640
和我一起把这件事当成商机来经营怎么样
pursuing this with me as a business opportunity?

384
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,720
我想想吧
Let me think about it.

385
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,190
但首先  这个东西借给我用几天
But first, let me borrow that thing for a few days.

386
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,370
想不想跟我说说
Wanna tell me why 

387
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,110
为什么你在我助理的律师资格申请上
you're playing games with my associate's

388
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,350
耍把戏
admission to the Bar?

389
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,650
-你是哈维・斯派克特  -亲自驾到
- You're Harvey Specter. - In the flesh,

390
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,600
如果我离开的时候
and if I don't walk out of here 

391
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,010
没有拿到预约
with an appointment in my hand,

392
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,360
我保证你明白我的厉害
you're gonna find out what that means,

393
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,360
因为瑞秋・赞恩有资格说明她的观点
because Rachel Zane deserves to make her case.

394
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,840
瑞秋・赞恩
Rachel Zane.

395
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,680
肯定是安排上出了问题
This is clearly a scheduling error.

396
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,650
抱歉  我会
Sorry. I will, uh,

397
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,000
把她的面谈定在两周后
set her interview for two weeks from today.

398
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,930
我本该说谢谢
I'd say thank you, 

399
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,020
但这是你本来就该做的
but you should've done that in the first place.

400
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,050
但是我觉得她过不了关
I don't think she's gonna pass, though.

401
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,990
-你说什么  -我只是觉得你应该知道
- What'd you say? - I just thought you should know

402
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,060
投票必须委员会全体成员
the vote has to be unanimous

403
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,450
一致通过才行
among the members of the committee,

404
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,410
我有预感
and I have a sense that

405
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,690
至少有一个人会不同意
at least one isn't gonna say yes.

406
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,310
你原本就能把她驳回
Well, you could've just rejected her,

407
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,920
但你还自找麻烦把我弄来
but you went to the trouble to get me down here,

408
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,110
所以有话快说
so get to it.

409
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,080
我只是说
Well, I'm just saying...

410
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,640
如果有个人打算  比如
that if someone were to, say,

411
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,620
告我最大的竞争对手  金额足够大
sue my biggest competitor for enough money

412
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,570
使得他们的股价暴跌
so that their stock price plummets,

413
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,880
或许赞恩女士的机会能大有转机
perhaps Ms. Zane's chances would take a turn for the better.

414
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,360
是不是这么说
Let me get this straight,

415
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,050
你在道德委员会之中
you're on the Ethics Committee,

416
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,030
而你却在要求我做违法的事情
and you're asking me to do something illegal.

417
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,450
如果找到合法的理由去告他们就不违法
It's not illegal if you can find  a legitimate reason to sue them.

418
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,820
那这事情肯定另有内情
Then there's gotta be more to the story,

419
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,880
不然你用不着把我找来
or you wouldn't be calling me in here,

420
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,760
勒索我去做这件事情
blackmailing me into doing this.

421
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,420
内情就是
The more to the story is,

422
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,420
你一直对道德问题很模糊
you have a history of ethical ambiguity,

423
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,860
而我需要的就是这个
and that's what this requires.

424
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,260
你要么去做  要么不做
And you're either gonna do it, or you're not.

425
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,530
不论如何  正如我所说
Either way, like I said,

426
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,920
赞恩女士的面试在两周后
Ms. Zane's interview is in two weeks.

427
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,690
疏忽致险  开玩笑吗
Reckless endangerment? Is this a joke?

428
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,100
我保证  索菲亚・普莱斯现在可没在笑
I guarantee you, Sofia Price isn't laughing.

429
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,180
任何心智正常的法官
Well, any judge in his right mind

430
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,290
都会在法庭上嘲笑死你
is gonna laugh you out of court,

431
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,790
因为你压根不懂法律
because you don't understand the law.

432
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,440
不懂法的是你
No, you're the one that doesn't understand the law,

433
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,480
约翰逊女士
Ms. Johnson.

434
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,950
你在租客未撤离的情况下开始拆除工作
You started demolition with tenants still in your building.

435
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,830
致使一个三岁孩子住进了急诊室
You sent a three-year-old to the emergency room.

436
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,030
你在这儿做文章  我会对妈妈火力全开
You pursue this, I'm going straight after the mother,

437
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,880
使她成为疏忽方
and I'll turn her into the negligent party,

438
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,520
到时候她能留住儿子就不错了
and she'll be lucky to keep her son.

439
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,610
你要是这么做  我就会向法庭展示
You do that, and I'll show the court

440
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,790
你和市政签署了建筑计划
that you filed construction plans with the city,

441
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,110
声称该建筑已经无人居住
claiming that the building was empty,

442
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,290
这在刑法里是可以判刑的
which is punishable under the criminal code.

443
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,010
不  罗斯先生  你什么都不会展示的
No, Mr. Ross, you won't show them anything.

444
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,540
要展示的是他
He will.

445
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,750
你觉得我不会查你吗
Did you think I wouldn't check up on you

446
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,860
突然之间
when all of a sudden, 

447
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,650
一个皇后区的法律诊所跟中城区律所一样
a Queens legal clinic starts acting like a Midtown law form.

448
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,040
我查了
Well, I did.

449
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,110
如果这件事上了法庭
And if this goes to trial,

450
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,710
他才是我要对付的人
he's the one I'm up against,

451
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,210
我们都知道上次发生了什么
and we all know what happened last time.

452
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,630
如果你只想跟我说这些就不会来了
You wouldn't be here if that's all you wanted to tell me.

453
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,930
不如赶紧不给我一个数字
So why don't you give me a number,

454
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,340
我转达给我的客户
and I'll take it to my client.

455
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,510
一万美金  一分钱都多不了
$10,000. Not a penny more.

456
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,290
我在中城区律所的经验告诉我
You see, all my experience at a Midtown law firm

457
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,840
你得到的授权是两万
tells me you're authorized to go to 20,

458
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,790
干脆咱们定两万五  完事大吉
so let's say 25 and call it a day.

459
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,530
两万五美金
$25,000?

460
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,130
刑事诉讼  琳达
Criminal charges, Linda.

461
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,680
如果我是你  我会像捡了便宜一样
So if I were you, I'd cut that check,

462
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,580
立刻签支票
consider it a bargain, 

463
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,070
祈求上苍那个孩子的病情不会恶化
and hope to hell that little boy doesn't get worse.

464
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,390
运气怎样
Hey, any luck?

465
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,570
取决于你对这个词的定义了
Depends on your definition of the word.

466
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,070
我见到给瑞秋发函的那个混蛋了
I met with the asshole that sent the letter to Rachel.

467
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,120
我猜猜  你没能说服他
Let me guess, you couldn't convince him 

468
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,980
给瑞秋安排面试
to give her an interview.

469
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,400
面试安排好了
No, I got her the interview,

470
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,490
但投票必须是全体通过
but the vote has to unanimous,

471
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,800
而他对他的投票标了价
and he's putting a price on his vote.

472
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,820
他想要什么
What does he want?

473
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,280
他想让我们针对他最大的竞争对手
He wants us to fabricate a lawsuit

474
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,660
捏造一个诉讼
against his biggest competitor.

475
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,880
上帝啊  这不是个要求
Jesus Christ, that's not an ask, 

476
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,850
是犯罪行为
that's a criminal action.

477
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,170
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know that?

478
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,460
好吧  哈维  如果找到了合法诉讼理由
Okay, Harvey, if we find a legitimate suit,

479
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,190
就不算违法了
it doesn't have to be illegal,

480
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,180
而眼下这种情况  还是值得做的
which means, under the circumstances, maybe it's worth doing.

481
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,620
不了解事情的全部之前我什么也不会做的
I'm not doing shit until I know the full story on this guy.

482
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,330
哈维  现在摆在面前的是瑞秋的未来
Harvey, this is Rachel's future we're talking about.

483
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,160
我知道
Yeah, I know it is, 

484
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
但他想要的不止这些
but I'm telling you this isn't all he wants,

485
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,460
但除非我弄清楚所有真相
and I'm not going to agree to anything

486
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,420
我是不会答应他的
until I know what the hell it really is.

487
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,790
所以我们怎么办
Well, what are we gonna do?

488
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,350
要做什么的不是我  是你
I'm not doing anything. You are.

489
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,020
我不懂
I don't understand.

490
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,950
路易  你能承认我善后的能力比你强
Louis, you were man enough to admit to me

491
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,010
可以  这很男人
that I'm better at fixing things.

492
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,610
而你也确实有些地方比我强
Well, you're better at something than me,

493
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,530
那就是金融交易
and it's called financial transactions.

494
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,790
我很感激这么说  哈维  但这很重要吗
I appreciate that, Harvey, but what does that matter?

495
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,220
这个人这样做是为了拉低别人的股价
This guy's doing this to drive down someone's stock price,

496
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,610
我想知道他这么做原因何在
and I wanna know why.

497
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,010
我会处理的
I'll take care of it.

498
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,230
我们怎么跟瑞秋说
What do we tell Rachel?

499
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,130
实话实说  就是文件出错
The truth-that it was a mix-up,

500
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,830
现在她已经拿到了面试日期
but now she's got a date on the books.

501
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,260
而你我得在这日期前搞定此事
And you and I need to fix this before then.

502
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,560
索菲亚
Sofia.

503
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,690
-他怎么样了  -他还好
- How is he? - He's okay.

504
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,750
他们说他过几天就能出来了
They said he should get out in a couple of days.

505
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,520
我有几个好消息
I have some good news.

506
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,120
我们的家能保住了吗
We can stay in our place?

507
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,900
不是
No.

508
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,690
但是你们有一个月的时间找新家
But you have a month to find a new place,

509
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,240
以及两万五千美元帮你们找
and a check for $25,000 to help you find it.

510
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,490
罗斯先生  我非常感激你做的一切
Mr. Ross, I'm grateful for everything you've done,

511
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,360
但玛莉莎跟我说如果我们能证明
but Marissa told me that if we could prove

512
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,650
AJ出事是他们的责任的话
what happened to AJ is their fault,

513
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,740
他们就必须要给钱
they'd have to pay.

514
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,720
他们已经给了啊
They are paying.

515
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,060
但他们至少该出够他的治疗费吧
Shouldn't they pay at least enough for his treatment?

516
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,250
他光明年的注射治疗费
His injections next year are gonna be

517
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,120
就要两万五千美元啊
$25,000 right there.

518
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,110
索菲亚  法庭有风险
Sofia, going to court is always risk.

519
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,630
我们的生活本来风险就不少
Our lives have been one risk after another.

520
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,350
可这支票不是风险啊  这是实实在在的钱
This check isn't a risk. This is real money.

521
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,830
如果我们赢了我们能拿多少
How much could we get if we win?

522
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,620
最高的话  五十万
Absolute best case-$500,000--

523
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,770
-但我跟你说  -拜托了  罗斯先生
- but I'm telling you... - Please, Mr. Ross.

524
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,420
他们已经害他成了这样
They did this to him,

525
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,040
如果我们有机会改变他的生活
and if we have a chance to change his life,

526
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,000
就得冒这个险
we need to take it.

527
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,410
那好吧
Okay.

528
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,770
路易  有什么能我帮忙的吗
Louis, can I help you?

529
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,710
我只是在回忆我以前站在这里
I was just thinking about when I stood here years ago,

530
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,930
告诉你  你进不了哈佛的时候
and I had to tell you that you weren't gonna get into Harvard.

531
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,290
你当时也以为你永远做不了律师了
You thought you'd never be a lawyer,

532
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,350
但我知道你会有办法的
but I knew you'd find a way.

533
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,610
你替我拿到了面试机会
You got me my interview.

534
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,950
是的
I did.

535
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,220
结果...
Turns out...

536
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,600
只是文件出错
It was just a mix-up.

537
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,340
谢谢你  路易
Thank you, Louis.

538
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,640
你觉得我还用就我和迈克的关系
Do you think I'm still gonna have to defend myself

539
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,640
为我自己进行辩护吗
about my relationship with Mike?

540
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,350
我不知道  瑞秋
I don't know, Rachel,

541
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,330
但我知道的是  无论付出什么代价
but I do know we're gonna do whatever it takes

542
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,910
我们都要保证你能成为一名律师
to make sure you become a lawyer.

543
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,130
我已经名花有主了
I'm seeing someone.

544
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,670
这些不是给你的  是给我未婚妻的
These aren't for you. They're for my fiancée.

545
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,030
但如果这能让你答应交易  那就留着好了
But if it'll get you to close this deal, you can keep 'em.

546
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,710
我可以给她再买一束
I'll just buy her another bouquet.

547
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,200
-我已经搞定了  -并没有
- I already closed this deal. - Turns out you didn't.

548
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,620
-你说话不算话啊  -计划赶不上变化
- That is bad faith. - Circumstances changed.

549
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,980
就今天和今晚之间能有什么变了
What the hell changed between today and tonight?

550
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,470
我的客户发现她儿子需要更进一步的治疗
My client found out that her son needs more treatment,

551
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,820
所以就需要更多钱
which means she needs more money.

552
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,680
我倒觉得是你客户
I think what happened is your client's seeing

553
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,330
发现有更大的利可图
an opportunity for a bigger payday,

554
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,690
而你无法说服她
and you can't control her.

555
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,480
你怎么想的并不重要
Well, what you think doesn't really matter.

556
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,350
如果你不把协议金额加到十万
If you don't raise your offer to $100,000,

557
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,540
那我们就法庭见
we're going to court. 

558
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,110
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

559
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,220
这儿可不是华尔街
This isn't Wall Street.

560
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,540
我们不会给这么多的
We don't give out that kind of money.

561
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,720
可如果你输了  你们要给的
If you lose, you're going to be giving out

562
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
就比这多得多了
a hell of a lot more than that. 

563
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,740
可如果我同意了
And if I agree to this,

564
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,480
你明天就会得寸进尺  要的更多
you'll be right back here tomorrow, asking for more.

565
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,370
听着  我打包票
Look, I'm telling you,

566
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,510
肯定能说服她同意这个条件的
I can get her to agree to this.

567
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,960
那我也明确告诉你  我条件已经开过了
And I am telling you, you've had your offer.

568
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,070
你能拿到的就这么多
That's all your gonna get,

569
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,370
如果你现在不接受  那就法庭见
and if you don't take it right now, we're going to trial,

570
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,930
我要让那孩子翻不了身
and I am gonna wipe the floor with this kid.

571
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,310
这我可不敢说
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

572
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,250
听我说
Listen to me, 

573
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,500
如果你觉得你能耍些小手段
if you think you're gonna pull some kind of trick

574
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,370
让你坐在他旁边和他手挽手一起面对的话
to get you to be able to sit next to him and hold his hand,

575
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,010
那是不可能的
there's no way that's gonna happen,

576
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,050
因为你已经是个铁打的诈欺犯了
because you were deemed a fraud,

577
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,650
没有法官会让你把他自己的法庭
and no judge in the world is gonna let you

578
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,680
搅成一个笑话的
turn his court into a joke.

579
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,190
天呐  哈维的字也太丑了
Jesus Christ, Harvey's handwriting is so bad,

580
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,460
我的医生跟他比起来就像书法家了
he makes my doctor look like a calligrapher.

581
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,640
别说了  姐们
You're telling me, sister.

582
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,390
他的笔迹比梅尔・吉布森的周六夜晚还糟糕
That handwriting's sloppier than Mel Gibson on a Saturday night.

583
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,940
我了个去  你能根据现实这么快应用我的话
Holy shit, you can adjust my phrases to the situation at hand?

584
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,850
当然能了
Of course I can.

585
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,330
你以为你是在和谁打交道
Who do you think you're dealing with?

586
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,350
实际上
As a matter of fact, 

587
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,080
我刚刚把"我了个去"加进我的词库里
I just incorporated "Holy shit" into my vocabulary right now.

588
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,740
不可能  这个词早就该有了
No way, that had to have already been in there.

589
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,630
看看是谁终于出现在派对上了
Well, look who finally showed up to the party.

590
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,230
《派对》由真・唐娜自编自导自演
"The Party," written by, produced by, and starring The Donna.

591
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,150
我喜欢你的想法
I like the way you think.

592
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,670
当然了  我就是你
Of course you do. I'm you.

593
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,360
你知道你的表现如何吗  棒呆了
And you know what you are? Awesome.

594
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,990
你想休息一下喝杯咖啡吗
You want to take a coffee break?

595
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,130
我觉得这是我们该得的
I think we've earned it.

596
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,300
我也是这么想的
Yeah. Me too.

597
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,350
坚决不喝格蕾琴喜欢的克里格的咖啡机
And none of that Keurig shit that Gretchen likes.

598
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,190
要么喝鲜煮的  要么就不喝
Fresh brewed, or nothing.

599
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,650
你什么时候变得这么泼辣了
When did you get so sassy?

600
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,080
哈维  太好了  你来了
Harvey, good, you're here.

601
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,200
我收到你的消息了  你发现什么了吗
I got your message. Did you find something?

602
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,210
你觉得呢
You tell me.

603
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,320
-这能解释很多问题  是不是  -没错
- Explains a lot, doesn't it? - It does.

604
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,600
干得漂亮  我就从这接手了
Good work. I'll take it from here.

605
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,530
-等等  你要去哪  -你觉得呢
- Wait, where are you going? - Where do you think I'm going?

606
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,130
我要去会会这个混蛋  跟他说清楚
I'm gonna see that asshole and set him straight.

607
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,200
但我给你点了个三明治
But I ordered you a sandwich--

608
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,100
火鸡肉不要蛋黄酱多加酸黄瓜  你最爱的
turkey, no mayo, extra pickles, like you like it.

609
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,120
你到底想不想让我解决瑞秋的问题了
Do you want me to fix Rachel's problem or not?

610
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,510
我想  只是...
I do. It's just...

611
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,930
我以为我们能谈谈
I thought we could talk.

612
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,210
你是指谈什么
What do you mean talk?

613
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,410
哈维  求你了  我需要一场男人间的对话
Harvey, please, I need to talk to you man-to-man.

614
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,770
不是工作上的事
It's not about business.

615
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,420
你真的给我点的多加酸黄瓜
Did you really get me extra pickles?

616
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,710
唐娜以前告诉过我你好这口
Donna once told me that's what you like.

617
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,720
好吧  路易  我有点时间
Okay, Louis, I got a few minutes.

618
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,110
你真的能辨别出来是不是鲜煮的
You really can tell if it's fresh brewed or not?

619
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,170
拜托  我可是个老手了
Please, this isn't my first rodeo.

620
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,900
可不是吗
You're telling me.

621
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,580
唐娜  我能跟你谈谈吗
Donna, could I talk to you for a second?

622
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,780
当然了  你需要什么  美女
Of course you can. What do you need, hot pants?

623
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,960
这是什么
What--what is that?

624
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,780
一个叫真・唐娜的设备
It's a device called The Donna

625
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,350
本杰明搞的  帅呆了
that Benjamin's working on, and it's awesome.

626
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,760
来吧  随便问它
Go ahead, ask it something.

627
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,370
我不想问它
I don't wanna ask it something.

628
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,720
我想问你
I wanna ask you something.

629
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,310
不  重点是  它就是我
No, that's the whole point. It is me.

630
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,040
如果你说的你  是想说比你更好  我同意
If by you, you mean much better than you.

631
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,580
看见没  我说什么来着
See? What did I tell you?

632
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,020
唐娜  我是认真的
Donna, I'm serious.

633
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,830
听着  这东西确实很有趣
Look, this is a really cute joke,

634
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,630
但我能不能和我的朋友谈一谈
but can I please just have a conversation with my friend?

635
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,350
如果指朋友  你是想说
If by friend, you mean--

636
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,280
当然了  瑞秋
Of course you can, Rachel.

637
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,590
你需要什么
What do you need?

638
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,230
我理理清楚
So let me get this straight,

639
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,150
你爱上了一个女人
you're in love with a woman 

640
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,130
你们才刚刚认识
that you've known for about ten minutes.

641
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,790
她已经有了别的男人的孩子
She's having another man's baby,

642
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,440
尽管如此  你还要娶她
and yet, you're gonna marry her,

643
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,940
然后把孩子当做自己的养
and raise it as your own.

644
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,870
简而言之是这样
In a nutshell.

645
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,190
你想从我这知道点什么
What exactly do you want from me?

646
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,460
我需要你的意见
I need your advice.

647
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,210
明天做B超的时候那家伙会在场
The guy's gonna be at the sonogram tomorrow,

648
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,420
我怕我到时候当众闹事
and I'm afraid I may cause a scene.

649
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,790
路易  我不明白你找我干什么
Louis, I don't understand what you're coming to me for.

650
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,870
-我又不懂...  -这就是原因
- What do I know about - Here, this is why.

651
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,570
明白了吗
Yeah, you get it?

652
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,300
这就是我找你的原因
This is why I'm coming to you.

653
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,610
他长得挺帅的
Oh, he's good-looking.

654
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,790
他不只是长得帅
He's not just good-looking.

655
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,710
他简直就是文艺复兴时期的雕塑
He's a goddamn Renaissance statue.

656
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,330
我需要知道他怎么想的
And I need to know what he's thinking.

657
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,830
路易  我代表不了所有的帅哥
Louis, I don't speak for all handsome men.

658
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,350
当你见到我的时候你看到了什么
What do you see when you look at me?

659
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,480
什么
What?

660
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,110
我想知道你见到我的时候看到了什么
I wanna know what you see when you look at me.

661
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,810
就现在  说实话
Right now, be honest. 

662
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,800
前三个从你脑海里蹦出的词
Say the first three things that pop into your head.

663
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,990
-牙齿鼻子牙齿  -该死  严肃点
- Teeth, nose, teeth. - God damn it! Be serious.

664
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,850
我是认真的
I am being serious.

665
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,980
好吧  你知道吗...
Well, you know what--

666
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,410
算了  我就不该找你
Never mind. I shouldn't have come to you.

667
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,550
路易  我看到了什么不重要
Louis, it doesn't matter what I see.

668
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,300
重要的是这个女人能看到了什么
What matters is what this woman sees,

669
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,960
她显然是看到了什么
and she obviously sees something,

670
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,350
不然不会和你在一起
or she wouldn't be with you.

671
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,070
而是和他在一起了
She'd be with him.

672
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,980
谢谢你  哈维  但是你了解我
Look, I appreciate that, Harvey, but you know me.

673
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,810
我要和那个男的共处一室
I'm gonna be in the same room as him,

674
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,070
看着他们俩结晶的图像
looking at an image of what he made with her.

675
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,820
我要怎么控制住自己
How do I not lose my shit?

676
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,110
你说的没错  这是他的孩子
You're right. It is his baby.

677
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,770
但这也是你的
But it's yours too.

678
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,050
你会想让宝宝得到的爱越多越好
And you're gonna want it to have as much love as it possibly can,

679
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,980
这意味着你要处理好和它生父的关系
and that means having a good relationship with its father,

680
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,380
因为没有什么比家人更重要了
because there's nothing more important than family.

681
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,180
你说得对
You're right.

682
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,360
谢谢你  哈维
Thank you, Harvey.

683
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,030
迈克  大伙怎么样了
Hey, Mike. How's it going out there?

684
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,010
有什么需要吗
What can I do for you?

685
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,560
我想让你看下这个
I want you to take a look at this.

686
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,590
我理理清楚
Let me get this straight,

687
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,850
你想让奥利佛去去向法院申请
you want Oliver to petition the court

688
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,420
-让玛莉莎为他的案子辩护  -是的
- to let Marissa argue his case. - Yes, I do.

689
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,830
-但那不可能  -为什么
- Well, that's not gonna happen. - Why not?

690
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,120
因为他是经过训练的律师
'Cause he's a full-fledged attorney,

691
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,070
而玛莉莎是一个法学院三年级学生
and she's a third-year law student.

692
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,500
他上法庭会慌的
He gets flustered in court.

693
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,690
而她从来就没上过庭
And she's never even been to court.

694
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,510
我要跟你说我觉得他搞不定这件案子
I'm telling you that I don't think that he can handle this.

695
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,660
她能搞定  此时这个女人的未来悬于一线
She can, and this woman's future is on the line.

696
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,110
那就说服她接受协议
Then convince her to take the deal.

697
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,610
她不想要这份协议
She doesn't want the deal.

698
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,310
你这是为难我  迈克
Putting me in a hell of a spot here, Mike.

699
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,080
纳森  你不是平白无故雇我的
Nathan, you hired me for a reason.

700
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,500
你告诉我管理这些人
You told me to run the associates,

701
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,150
我也正在这么做
and I'm running them.

702
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,830
那现在你到底让不让我做
Now, are you gonna let me do that or not?

703
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,060
你要做  就去做
You're gonna do it, do it,

704
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,040
但你自己去跟奥利佛说
but you're gonna be the one to tell Oliver.

705
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,020
你要见我
You wanted to see me?

706
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,980
是的  请进
Yeah, I, uh--I did. Come in.

707
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,650
我想跟你说下索菲亚・普莱斯的案子
I want to talk to you about the, uh, Sofia Price case.

708
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,370
好极了  因为我还要告诉你
Great, because I actually wanted to tell you about

709
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,590
新泽西州有五起相似案件都赢得了大笔和解费
five similar cases in New Jersey that won huge settlements.

710
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,760
干得好  我们用得上
That's good work, and we can use that.

711
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,960
不过我需要你做些事情
But listen, I need you to do something for me.

712
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,890
你想让玛莉莎作为主辩
You want Marissa to be first chair.

713
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,760
我觉得这样最好
I think it's for the best.

714
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,480
迈克  我知道为什么你觉得这要更好
Mike, I know why you think this is the right choice,

715
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,320
-但我能做好  -对不起  奥利佛
- but I can do this. - I'm sorry, Oliver,

716
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,700
但在你现在的工作状态
but at this point in your career,

717
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,100
我觉得你做不到
I don't think you can.

718
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,490
-迈克  -奥利佛
- Mike. - Oliver--

719
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,470
你自己都说  你在庭上会慌
you said it yourself-you get flustered in court.

720
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,070
我知道  但如果我要成为一个真正的律师
I know that, but if I'm going to be a real lawyer,

721
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,120
我必须在庭上要表现的更好
I have to get better in trial, 

722
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,910
而唯一的办法就是重装上阵
and the only way to do that is to get back on the horse.

723
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,000
我跟你说等接到合适的案子
And I'm telling you that when the right case comes along,

724
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,970
我保证让你上
I promise I will let you do that,

725
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,620
但这个案子不合适
but this is not the case.

726
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,670
这个是玛莉莎的
This one's Marissa's,

727
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,300
我需要你支持她
and I need to know you have her back.

728
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,870
我会的
I do.

729
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,040
很好
Good.

730
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,790
我去告诉她
I'll go tell her.

731
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,200
你不必这么做  奥利佛
You don't have to do that, Oliver.

732
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,080
我必须这么做
Yes, I do.

733
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,890
这样对诊所更好
It's better for the clinic

734
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,670
让她认为这是因为我对她有信心
if she thinks I have confidence in her,

735
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,850
而不是你对我没信心
not that you don't have confidence in me.

736
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,150
-你回来了  -你最好相信我回来了
- You're back. - You better believe I'm back,

737
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,610
因为我查了下你在搞什么鬼
because I looked into what you're doing

738
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,590
还有背后原因
and why you're doing it.

739
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,390
没有什么好查的  斯佩克特先生
There's really not much to find, Mr. Specter.

740
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,760
我来替你说吧
Well, let me lay it out for you.

741
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,340
极速数据处理公司偷了你的技术
Velocity Data Solutions stole your technology,

742
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,040
他们急着出售
and they're rushing it to market,

743
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,190
所以你想策划一个收购计划
so you want to orchestrate a takeover

744
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,180
来拿回属于你的东西  我说的对吗
and get back what's yours. That sound about right?

745
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,550
我的公司要垮了  就因为他们所做的事情
My company is gonna go under, because of what they did.

746
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,610
很多人会失业
People are gonna lose their jobs.

747
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,740
那就去找联调局
Then go to the FBI.

748
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,850
-我不能去  -为什么
- I can't. - Why not?

749
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,120
因为我不能
Because I can't.

750
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,430
行  我跟你说为什么你不能去
Yeah, I'll tell ya why you can't.

751
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,770
因为除非你别无选择
Because a squeaky clean guy like you

752
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,490
不然你这样身家清白的人不会来找我这样的人
doesn't come to a guy like me unless he's got no choice,

753
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,560
你需要我的程度远远超过
and you need me a hell of a lot more

754
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,340
我需要你  所以等你准备好说实情
than I need you, so why don't you give me a call

755
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,050
再给我打电话吧
when you're ready to tell the truth.

756
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,780
他们从我这里得到的技术
They got it from me.

757
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,010
我听着呢
I'm listening.

758
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,180
我出过轨
I had an affair.

759
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,810
我很笨很不小心  让她登入我的电脑
I was stupid and careless, and she got access to my laptop.

760
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,640
而你已婚了
And you're married,

761
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,730
不能让你老婆发现这件事
and your wife can't find out about it,

762
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,500
所以你不能去找联调局
and that's why you can't go to the FBI.

763
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,410
就是这样  现在你清楚了
There, now you know.

764
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,330
我只知道瑞秋・赞恩有资格成为律师
What I know is Rachel Zane deserves to be in the Bar,

765
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,690
你不仅不能阻止她
so you're not only gonna stop blocking her,

766
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,330
如果有人阻止她你还要出面干预
you're gonna run interference for her if someone else does.

767
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,350
我无权这么做
I don't have the power to do that.

768
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,190
胡扯  你有权阻止
Bullshit. You had the power to stop it,

769
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,910
你最好能扭转态势
and you better believe that you can turn it the other direction.

770
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,830
作为回报  你会做我让你做的事
And in return, you'll do what I want.

771
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,510
不
No.

772
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,900
你得这么做  因为这样是对的
You're gonna do it, because it's the right thing to do.

773
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,670
但我会为了其他事情帮你
But I'll do what you want for something else.

774
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,490
我有事找你谈
I need to talk to you.

775
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,340
什么事
What's going on?

776
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,820
奥利佛把所有索菲亚的案子的文件给了我
Oliver just gave me all the case files for Sofia.

777
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,540
他说我应该把这事做到底
He said I'm the one who should bring this home.

778
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,290
是的  我知道
Yeah, I know.

779
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,870
我们谈过了  我也赞同他的想法
We talked about it, and I agree with him.

780
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,030
迈克  我知道这不是奥利佛的注意
Mike, I know this wasn't Oliver's idea.

781
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,240
这是你的主意
It was yours.

782
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,660
因为你觉得他没有准备好
'Cause you don't think he's ready.

783
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,330
我也是为此来找你
Which is why I'm coming to you.

784
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,380
-玛莉莎  你能搞定  -我知道我能搞定
- Marissa, you can handle this. - I know I can,

785
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,020
但问题是我不能这么做
but the problem is I can't do it.

786
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,250
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

787
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,540
我父亲患病多时
Um, my father's been sick,

788
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,910
我一直闭口不谈  是因为我不喜欢
and I haven't talked about it, because I don't like to...

789
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,190
但他现在需要做手术
But now he needs surgery,

790
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,620
我几周前就提出休假了
and I put in for the time off weeks ago,

791
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,240
我必须在那儿陪着他
and I have to be there for him,

792
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,980
但现在我准备告诉你
but now that I'm telling you this,

793
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,910
我觉得或许我可以提早几天飞回来
I'm thinking maybe I could fly back a few days early,

794
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,380
-或者我可以晚一天再去  -别说了
- or I could get there a day later - Stop, stop, stop.

795
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,740
没事
It's okay.

796
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,180
-我想帮索菲娅  迈克  -我知道你想
- I wanna help Sofia, Mike. - I know you do.

797
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,250
但你需要陪着你父亲
But you need to be with your father.

798
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,420
那你怎么办
What are you gonna do?

799
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,340
我会想出办法的
I'll figure something out.

800
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,900
唐娜  你好  你喜欢那个
Donna, hey, how did you like the--

801
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,980
不行
It's a no.

802
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,360
"不行"是什么意思
What do you mean it's a no?

803
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,850
我是说这东西很有趣  但我没兴趣
I mean it's a cute joke, but I'm not interested

804
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,840
把它看作一个商机
in pursuing it as a business opportunity.

805
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,180
我不理解  我以为你喜欢这个想法
I don't understand. I thought you liked the idea.

806
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,240
的确  但那是在我意识到
I did, but that was before I realized

807
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,960
它只会说点俏皮话和时评之前
that it was nothing but quippy lines and sassy remarks.

808
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,760
但那就是你
But that's who you are.

809
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,940
不  本杰明
No, Benjamin.

810
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,320
那是我的其中一面
That's part of who I am,

811
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,620
你所看到的那面
and that's the only part you've ever seen,

812
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,010
但那是因为我们俩并不了解彼此
but that's because we don't really know each other.

813
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:36,090
但若我们了解彼此  你会知道我真正的特长
But if we did, you'd know that what really makes me special

814
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,980
是我的直觉和同情心
is my intuition and my empathy

815
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,750
以及我的真心
and my heart,

816
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,220
而这里都没有  所以
and this doesn't have any of that, so...

817
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,260
我很抱歉  但是不行
I'm sorry, but it's a no.

818
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,460
迈克
Mike.

819
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,050
我很想现在聊聊  但是不行
I'd love to chat right now, but I can't.

820
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,680
我正准备看个电影换换心情
I'm actually going to a movie for a change.

821
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,420
好  我只占用你一点时间
Yeah, I just need a second.

822
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,020
什么事
What's up?

823
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,930
明天的普莱斯案我想让你来做辩护
I need you to argue the Price case tomorrow.

824
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,590
你刚才说想让我干嘛  因为听起来好像
What'd you just ask me? Because it sounded like

825
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,440
在你让我接手前求我让给玛莉莎的
you want me to take the case that you begged me

826
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,270
-案子  -我确实让她接手了
- to give to Marissa. - I did give it to her,

827
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,410
但你没告诉我她父亲要动手术
but you didn't tell me that her father had surgery.

828
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,750
因为我不知道她父亲要动手术
Because I didn't know her father had surgery.

829
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,830
她提申请了
She put in for it.

830
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,070
我才不管这种烂事
And I don't pay attention to that shit.

831
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,790
-让奥利佛来接手  -我告诉过你他会输的
- Give it back to Oliver. - I told you he'll lose.

832
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,600
-那就输掉吧  -抱歉  我得走了
- Then he'll lose. Now I'm sorry, but I have to go.

833
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,070
该死  这事关一个女人的一生
God damn it, this is a woman's life,

834
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,430
而你却要去看什么电影
and you're going to a goddamn movie.

835
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,620
你到底怎么回事
What the hell is wrong with you?

836
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,280
你是在
Are you f--

837
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,180
听着  我们在家法律诊所工作
Listen, we work in a clinic.

838
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,390
我们每位当事人的生活都岌岌可危
Every one of our client's lives is hanging by a thread,

839
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,230
如果他们输了  他们会流离失所
and if they lose, they're out on the street,

840
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,290
他们不能做手术  也可能被驱赶出境
they don't get the surgery, or they get deported.

841
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,210
那才是生活
That's life.

842
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,380
我已经五年没享受生活了
And I haven't had a life in five years,

843
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,820
这是我雇你的原因
which is why I hired you,

844
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,760
所以别再和我说那些
so don't you ever say that to me again.

845
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,280
听着  我们只能请到奥利佛这样的律师
Look, Oliver's the kind of lawyer we get here.

846
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,540
如果他解决不了  那就解决不了
If he can't handle it, he can't handle it.

847
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,450
只能这样了
That's how it goes.

848
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,790
那么我会向法庭请求坐他的旁席
Then I wanna petition the court to sit at the table with him.

849
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,040
不行
No.

850
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,990
我们可以请求特殊豁免
We can ask for a special exemption, and--

851
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,000
我的回答是不行  听见了吗
And I said no, all right?

852
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,180
你又不是法庭人员
You're not an officer of the court.

853
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,310
他们不会同意  那也不再是你该做的
They will not grant it, and that is not your place here.

854
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,240
那么至少我可以坐在他旁边  我可以
Then at least I can sit near him, and I can--

855
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,920
你现在给我听好了
You hear me right now!

856
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,250
我因为所需  才给了你一次机会
I gave you a chance, because I needed it,

857
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,740
但如果你为了一个租房案
but if you risk the reputation of this clinic

858
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,570
拿这家法律诊所的名声冒险  我就让你走人
over one housing case, I will fire you

859
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,830
并且保证你以后
and make sure that you are banned from

860
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,210
再难在法庭立足
ever sitting foot in a courtroom again.

861
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,520
听清楚了吗
Is that clear?

862
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,180
-听清楚了吗  -好
- Is that clear? - Yes.

863
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,130
听清楚了
It's clear.

864
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,750
你这地方"不错"
This is a nice place you got here.

865
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:44,980
准备什么时候报废
When are they condemning it?

866
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,160
你来这儿干嘛  哈维
What are you doing here, Harvey?

867
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,410
我要跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

868
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,500
现在不是时候  我得想明白怎么
Now's not a good time. I gotta figure out how--

869
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,860
如果我告诉你我有办法让你拿到律师资格呢
What if I told you I have a way to get you into the Bar?

870
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,420
什么
What?

871
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,920
有人想在我们面前对
Someone came to us trying to play games

872
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,390
瑞秋的品行考核面试做手脚
with Rachel's Character and Fitness interview and--

873
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,750
等等  你在说什么
Wait, what--what the hell are you talking about?

874
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,160
放松  我处理好了
Relax, I handled it,

875
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,600
但现在我们有机会让你也参加考核
but now we have a chance to get you in.

876
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,560
有什么条件
What's the catch?

877
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:11,870
迈克
Mike...

878
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,020
哈维  天下没有免费的午餐
Harvey, there are no free lunches.

879
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,200
有什么条件
What's the catch?

880
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,610
我们要对极速数据处理公司提起诉讼
We need to come up with a lawsuit against

881
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,430
使他们的股价下跌
Velocity Data Solutions to drive their stock price down.

882
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,000
你在开玩笑吗  不行
Are you kidding me? No.

883
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,460
不行是什么意思  你怎么了
What do you mean no? What--what's wrong with you?

884
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,380
我的问题是我真的不想
What's wrong with me is I don't particularly feel like

885
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,450
再回监狱了  而且我记得
going back to prison, and the last time I checked,

886
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,970
制造诉讼来操控股价是违法的
fabricating a lawsuit to manipulate a stock is illegal.

887
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,990
我们找个正当的诉讼理由就不算违法
It's not illegal if we find a legitimate suit.

888
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,130
这都是胡扯
That is such bullshit

889
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,910
那只是我们告诉自己的屁话
that we'd just be telling ourselves that,

890
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,640
就像我们告诉自己我们并没有和卡荷尔串通一样
just like we told ourselves we weren't colluding with Cahill.

891
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,910
那让你逃离了牢狱之灾
And that got you out of prison,

892
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,950
所以我们把这差事搞定
so let's finish the job,

893
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,070
恢复你的律师资格
and get you back to being a lawyer.

894
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,360
哈维  我现在比以前更像个律师
Harvey, I'm more a lawyer now than I ever was.

895
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,560
胡扯  你知道你就是个保姆
Oh, bullshit, you're a babysitter and you know it.

896
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,890
我在做我想做的事  我在帮助别人
Hey, I'm doing what I wanted, and I'm helping people,

897
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,480
所以如果你想把我当成保姆
so if you wanna call me a babysitter,

898
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,710
随你的便  但是现在房子着火了
you go right ahead, but right now the house is on fire,

899
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,670
孩子们都在卧室里
the kids are in the bedroom,

900
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,130
我他妈的会救他们的
and I'm about to goddamn save them.

901
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,260
迈克  我们现在遇到了机会
Mike, we have an opportunity right now.

902
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,020
再也不会出现这样的机会了
It's not gonna present itself again.

903
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,450
我很感激  哈维
I appreciate that, Harvey.

904
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,460
真的
I do.

905
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,700
但是我告诉你  我的回答是不
But I'm telling you, my answer is no.

906
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,440
怎么了
Hey, what's going on?

907
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,300
出现什么紧急情况了  玛莉莎呢
What's the emergency? Where's Marissa?

908
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,340
玛莉莎走了
Marissa's gone.

909
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,570
走了是什么意思
What do you mean gone?

910
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,030
我的意思是你明天是首席辩护人
I mean that you're first chair tomorrow,

911
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,920
我们得让你做好准备
and we need to get you ready.

912
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,300
什么
What?

913
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,570
-奥利佛  这没什么大不了的  -没什么大不了
- Oliver, it's not a big deal. - Not a big deal?

914
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,490
我们不能冒险让我再在法庭上搞砸了
We can't risk having me mess up in court again.

915
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,100
这个案子太重要了  你知道我是如何知道的吗
This case is too important. You know how I know that?

916
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,040
-是你告诉我的  -我知道我说过什么
- Because you told me. - I know what I said.

917
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,470
但是我们没有时间找别人了
But we don't have time to find anyone else.

918
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,380
明天就庭审了
The trial's tomorrow.

919
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,090
我们到底要不要做这件事
Now, are we gonna do this thing or not?

920
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,910
我第一次参加模拟法庭时出了件事
It happened at my first mock trial.

921
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,110
我准备得很充分
I was so prepared.

922
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,340
庭审开始
And then trial started,

923
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,240
对方提出了一个我没准备的问题
and the other side threw a wrinkle in.

924
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,420
我觉得我能随机应变
And I thought I could think on my feet,

925
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,630
但是突然间  我觉得所有人都在看着我
but all of a sudden, I felt everyone watching me,

926
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,860
我口干舌燥  大脑一片空白
and my mouth went dry, and my mind went blank,

927
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,140
我就愣住了
and I froze.

928
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,410
奥利佛...
Oliver...

929
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,730
我们可以一起渡过这个难关的
we can get through this together.

930
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,750
但你已经告诉过我我搞不定
Except now you told me I can't handle it,

931
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,730
那就像给我的大脑钻了个洞
and that's gonna be boring a hole in my brain,

932
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,500
让这事难了上千倍
making this thing a thousand times harder.

933
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,520
我不能收回我说过的话
Well, I can't take back what I said,

934
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,400
但是我能做的是整晚待在这
but what I can do is stay here all night

935
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,340
确保你证明我错了
to make sure you prove me wrong.

936
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,530
我不知道
I don't know.

937
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,260
你知道的
Yes, you do.

938
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,840
我想让你说出来
I want you to say it.

939
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,180
我们会赢下这个案子
We're gonna win this.

940
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,280
我们会赢下这个案子
We're going to win this.

941
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,510
再说一遍
Say it again.

942
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,680
我们会赢下这个案子
We're going to win this.

943
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,920
再说一次
One more time,

944
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,870
用上点真心
but this time mean it.

945
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,560
我们会赢下这个案子
We are going to win this.

946
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,730
他们要做的第一件事
Now, the first thing they're gonna do

947
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,800
-就是提出撤案动议  -事实上  他们已经这么做了
- is file a motion to dismiss. - Actually, they already did.

948
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,040
很好  那咱们来搞定这件事
Good. Let's work on that.

949
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,020
抱歉  我迟到了
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

950
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,170
我中途下车给约书亚买了个礼物
I had to stop off and get Joshua a present,

951
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,760
因为我想欢迎他加入我们这个大家庭
'cause I wanted to welcome him into the family.

952
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,720
路易  那好贴心啊
Louis, that is so sweet,

953
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,810
但是约书亚来不了了
but it turns out Joshua can't make it.

954
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,610
什么叫他来不了
What do you mean he can't make it?

955
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,130
本来他要飞过来的  但是工作上发生了点事
He was gonna fly in, but something came up with work,

956
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,690
所以他取消了航班
so he canceled his flight.

957
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,520
这他妈是个什么样的父亲啊
What the hell kind of father is that?

958
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,080
-路易  -简直扯淡
- Louis-- - This is bullshit.

959
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,300
这是他的骨肉
It's his flesh and his blood,

960
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,670
如果他想当孩子的爸爸  他得成为一个爸爸
and if he's gonna be father, he needs to be a father.

961
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,950
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

962
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,070
你一开始甚至都不想他出现在这里
You didn't even want him to be here in the first place.

963
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,340
我现在想了
Well, I want him here now.

964
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,430
路易  我原以为你比这更宽容
Louis, I thought you were a more forgiving person than this.

965
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,370
我还以为你想让孩子和它的生父
And I thought you wanted our baby to have a relationship

966
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,940
能够建立感情
with its biological father.

967
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,330
他会的
And he's going to.

968
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,210
但是如果你遇到像今天这样的事
But if you're gonna get this worked up

969
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,620
就这么激动的话
about something like this,

970
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,060
让我觉得我根本不了解你
it makes me think I don't really know you.

971
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,030
路易  你能老实告诉我  你真的了解我吗
Louis, can you honestly tell me that you really know me?

972
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,290
准备好做B超了吗
Are we ready to take a picture?

973
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,540
我不了解
No, I don't.

974
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,790
现在我觉得我毁了我们的兴致  所以...
And now I feel like I'm ruining this, so...

975
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,080
如果你不想让我和你进去  我就不进去了
if you don't want me to come in with you, I won't.

976
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,800
也许最好还是我自己一个人进去做
Maybe it's best if I just do this myself.

977
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,650
法官大人  这件事发生在三天前
Your Honor, this incident occurred three nights ago,

978
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,670
而那孩子有哮喘史
yet the boy has a history of asthma,

979
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,000
就说明哮喘和开工没关系
proving one has nothing to do with the other.

980
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,360
这些医院记录显示
These hospital records show

981
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,920
他的肺部有易碎的建筑材料
friable construction material in his lungs.

982
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,650
是怎么进入他的肺部呢
How did it get there?

983
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,310
可能是从100种不同的地方进入的
It could have gotten there from a hundred different places.

984
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,300
这个案子完全基于猜测
This case is based entirely on speculation,

985
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,580
应该被撤销
and it should be dismissed.

986
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,760
这个案子是基于你的客户
This case is based on the fact that your client

987
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,030
在租户还未搬走就开始动工这一事实
started construction while tenants were still in the building,

988
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,620
违反了房地产法令
in violation of the Real Estate Code.

989
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,170
如果我告诉你普莱斯女士同意了呢
And what if I told you Ms. Price signed off on this?

990
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,540
我会说那是不可能的  因为她没有
I'd say that's not possible, because she didn't.

991
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,620
你有你的文件
Well, you've got documents,

992
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,320
我有我的
and I have one too.

993
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,680
这是一份证明书复件
This is a copy of a certified letter

994
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,200
三周前由我的委托人提供给
from my client to the remaining tenants

995
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
在租租户
three weeks ago,

996
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,220
明确声明将开始装修工程
stating that construction will begin,

997
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,180
向所有住户提供了明确警告
giving fair warning to the occupants.

998
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,040
法官大人  我的委托人并未看过文件
Your Honor, my client's never seen that.

999
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,860
她也许是没看
Well, she might not have seen it,

1000
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,090
-但她收到了  -收到也不代表她打开了
- but she got it. - It doesn't mean she opened it,

1001
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,080
或者她就看了
or--or even read it.

1002
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,760
法律规定  她看没看不重要
According to the city, that doesn't matter.

1003
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,630
建筑法规305-A款
Building Code 305-A:

1004
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,800
"建筑施工需以证明书形式
"Tenants are required to be notified

1005
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,280
通知所有租户"
of all construction by certified letter."

1006
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,990
你说这算不算证明书
Is this a certified letter or not?

1007
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,860
该死的  奥利佛  说它不可采用
God damn it, Oliver, say it's inadmissible.

1008
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,560
它是算  但是...
Yes, it is, but--

1009
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,030
所以你承认了她被通知过
So you admit that she was notified,

1010
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,830
所以我的委托人不该为此负责
and therefore my client should be absolved of all liability.

1011
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,680
我没有...
I--I don't--I--

1012
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,920
反对
Objection!

1013
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,540
法官大人  这就是开庭前我跟您
Your Honor, this is the fraudulent attorney

1014
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,300
提过的那个欺诈律师
I spoke with you about before trial.

1015
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,010
我们请求禁止他在庭上发言
We ask that he either refrain from speaking,

1016
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,570
或者责令其离开法庭
or be removed from the court

1017
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,780
并且判决支持被告方
with an immediate ruling for the defense.

1018
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,920
允许
Request granted.

1019
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,410
先生  你再在庭上开口
Sir, open your mouth in my courtroom again,

1020
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,310
就会被逐出法庭  案子也会被撤销
and you will be removed, and this case will be dismissed.

1021
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,960
格雷迪先生  你是否要
Mr. Grady, do you have an objection

1022
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,890
反对约翰逊小姐的陈述
to Ms. Johnson's statement or not?

1023
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,260
不  对不起  我不反对
I don't. I'm sorry, I don't.

1024
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,780
那法庭别无选择
Then the court has no choice

1025
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,290
只能判决有偏见驳回起诉
but to dismiss this case with prejudice.

1026
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,750
本杰明  你别问了  我说过了...
Benjamin, before you ask, I already told you--

1027
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,470
要是我能让它更像你呢
What if I could make it more like you?

1028
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,990
什么意思
What do you mean?

1029
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,040
你说你最特殊的地方
You said what makes you special

1030
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,790
在于你的直觉  同情和心
is your intuition, your empathy, and your heart.

1031
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,590
要是我能让它拥有这些呢
What if I could make it have that?

1032
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,090
这怎么可能做到
How could you possibly do that?

1033
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,420
就像我能给它
The same way I gave it the ability

1034
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,080
学习俏皮话的能力一样  也许我能
to learn from your quips, I might be able to give it

1035
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,720
让它学到你的心
the ability to learn from your heart,

1036
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,930
但这需要你的帮助
but it would require your help.

1037
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,570
你真的觉得这可能吗
You really think we could do that?

1038
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,710
不知道  但我觉得值得一试
I don't know, but I know we can try.

1039
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,910
那你需要了解的第一件事就是
Well, then the first thing that you need to learn

1040
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:02,200
永远  永远不许坐我的椅子
is never, ever, ever sit in my chair.

1041
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,990
抱歉  我...
Oh, I'm sorry, I--I was--

1042
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,220
镇定  本杰明  我只是在逗你
Relax, Benjamin, I'm just messing with you.

1043
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,570
-但是从我的椅子上起来  -好的
- But get out of my chair. - Yeah.

1044
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,180
路易  你怎么来了
Louis, what-- what are you doing here?

1045
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,580
我有东西给你
I need to bring you a few things.

1046
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,220
这都是什么
What is all that?

1047
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,160
高中年鉴  童年相簿
High school yearbooks, childhood photo albums,

1048
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,180
还有成长过程七个精彩时刻中
and six out of seven of the highlight reels

1049
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,790
被妈妈照下来的六张照片
my mother shot of us growing up.

1050
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,140
少的那张是怎么回事
What happened to the seventh?

1051
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,370
那个夏天犯了点事
Oh... summer of D&D.

1052
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,740
如果你不介意的话
And if it's all the same to you,

1053
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,670
我希望你不会不愿跟我上床了
I would like to still be able to have sex again.

1054
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,990
-路易  -你说得对
- Louis-- - You were right.

1055
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,600
我们确实还不了解对方的所有
We don't know everything about each other,

1056
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,120
但我们应该做的是更深入的了解对方
but that just means we need to get to know each other better,

1057
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,520
而有什么能比一起做抚养孩子的准备
and what better way to get to know each other

1058
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,880
能更好的让我们了解对方呢
then by preparing to bring our child into the world?

1059
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:12,010
路易  如果这就是你对今天下午的事的回应
Louis, if this is your reaction to what we went through today,

1060
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,720
那我想我已经更加了解你了
I feel like I know you better already.

1061
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,920
说到今天下午的事
Speaking of what we went through today,

1062
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,430
情况如何
how'd it go?

1063
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,660
不如你带我回家
Why don't you take me home,

1064
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,000
我好好给你讲
and I'll tell you all about it.

1065
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,760
哈维  我能跟你谈谈吗
Harvey, can I talk to you for a second?

1066
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,280
当然  瑞秋  怎么了
Sure, Rachel. What's going on?

1067
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,650
是关于我跟
It's about my interview with

1068
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,280
品行考核委员会的面试
the Character and Fitness committee.

1069
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,350
-怎么了  -路易想骗我来着
- What about it? - Louis tried to lie to me.

1070
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,300
他说只是搞错了文件
He said it was some sort of mix-up,

1071
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,040
但我问唐娜时
but when I asked Donna about it,

1072
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,740
她跟我说去跟他们
she told me that you were the one

1073
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,750
谈的人是你  不是路易
who went to see that man for me, not Louis.

1074
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,510
哈维  没事的  你可以告诉我
Look, Harvey, it's okay, you can tell me.

1075
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,520
是因为迈克  是不是
It was about Mike, wasn't it?

1076
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,140
不是  是为了筹码
No, it was about leverage.

1077
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,030
什么意思
What do you mean?

1078
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,660
那个阻止你面试的人
The guy holding up your interview

1079
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,090
想让我们帮他办件事
was trying to get us to do something,

1080
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,660
因为他以为能威胁到我们
because he thought he could.

1081
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,390
那你要帮他办吗
Are you going to?

1082
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,240
要  他要
Yes. He is.

1083
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,060
你说的是我想的那个意思吗
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

1084
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:11,960
是的
Yeah.

1085
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,800
我答应
I'm in.
