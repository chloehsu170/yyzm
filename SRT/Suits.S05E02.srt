{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

16
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,910
-我要离开你了  哈维  -不能就这样辞职
- I'm leaving you, Harvey. - You can't just quit.

17
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,910
我不是要辞职
I'm not quitting.

18
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,020
我要去为路易工作
I'm going to work for Louis.

19
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,860
你要想治好失眠
Your sleepless nights aren't going to stop

20
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,020
就必须接受
until you accept the fact

21
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,870
你的秘书不会再回来这个事实
that your secretary isn't coming back.

22
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,870
我也说了  等她回来了  我就不会再失眠了
And I told you they'll stop when she does.

23
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,850
这是给你的正式通知  但我不会立刻
This is my formal notice, but I have no intention

24
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,650
把你晾下  所以我们还是讨论一下
of leaving you high and dry, so let's talk about

25
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,130
在两周内为你找一个新秘书吧
finding you someone in the next two weeks.

26
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,410
那你知道怎样对我最好吗
Do you know what's best for me?

27
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,840
-直面伤痛  -哈维
- Ripping the Band-Aid off. - Harvey--

28
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,980
所以你还是赶快收拾你的东西
So why don't you clean out your desk

29
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,300
搬去路易那里吧
and walk yourself over to Louis?

30
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,850
哈维  如果你对唐娜的事有任何不愉快...
Hey, Harvey, if there are any hard feelings with Donna--

31
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,390
不  路易  没有不愉快
No, Louis, no hard feelings.

32
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,630
但我只想说  如果万一有...
Okay, but I just want to say if there were--

33
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,900
我说了  没有
I said there's no hard feelings.

34
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,080
杰克・索罗夫正在律所里到处说
Jack Soloff has been going around the firm

35
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,920
你不可能挽救那家公司
saying you're never gonna save that company.

36
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,490
你什么时候开始在乎杰克・索罗夫说什么了
Since when do you care so much about what Jack Soloff says?

37
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,130
自从他成了一个有野心的资深合伙人
Since he's a senior partner with ambition.

38
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,300
我今天给你父亲打过电话了
I called your father today.

39
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,230
瑞秋・伊丽莎白・赞恩  你愿意嫁给我吗
Rachel Elizabeth Zane, will you marry me?

40
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,140
愿意
Yes.

41
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,330
为什么我就没权利挑吃饭的地方呢
How come I never get to pick the places we eat?

42
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,870
因为我不想吃鸡块当晚餐
Because I don't want chicken nuggets for dinner,

43
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,970
你也能少吃点那些东西
and you could take a break from them yourself.

44
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,080
但是在这块鸭肝慕斯上
I don't see a little healthy heart

45
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,690
我也没看到健康的心脏
next to this duck liver mousse.

46
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,830
真幽默  我让迈克试了
Very funny. I got Mike to try it.

47
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,450
妻管严这事我可帮不上忙
I can't help it if the man is whipped.

48
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,760
说到这  让我看看你妈妈一直念叨的
Speaking of which, let me see that ring

49
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,010
那个戒指
your mother keeps talking about.

50
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,350
好吧  看来他很清楚自己在干什么
Okay. I guess he knows what he's doing.

51
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,760
他要娶我了  所以  显然如此
Well, he's marrying me, so obviously.

52
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,520
既然说到这儿了
While we're on the topic...

53
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,910
-这是婚前协议  -是的  我让汤姆起草的
- This is a prenup. - Yeah. I had Tom draw it up.

54
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,850
其实就是一份标准化的协议
It's actually a standard boilerplate--

55
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,770
我不想让自己的婚姻
I don't wanna start my marriage

56
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,320
以规划如何结束为起点
planning how it's going to end.

57
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,110
瑞秋  婚前协议不是这个作用
Rachel, that is not what a prenup is for,

58
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,040
你也知道这点
and you know that.

59
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,590
是为了隔离资产  以保护你自己
It's to isolate assets in order to protect yourself.

60
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,210
我没有什么资产可以保护
I don't have assets to protect.

61
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,310
你有的
Yes, you do.

62
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,670
好吧
Right.

63
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,830
你是说你的钱
You're talking about your money.

64
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,220
自从我大学毕业
I haven't taken a dime from you

65
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,910
就没有要过你的一分钱
since the day I graduated from college.

66
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,820
是啊  或许是没有
Yeah, maybe not,

67
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,660
但总有一天你会得到我的全部身家
but one day you're gonna get everything I have.

68
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,460
爸爸
Dad--

69
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,760
瑞秋  到处都有人在离婚
Rachel, marriages end all the time,

70
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,660
我只想确保你得到应有的保护
and I just want to make sure that you're taken care of,

71
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,520
万一你和迈克出了什么问题
if something goes wrong between you and Mike.

72
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,880
万一我和迈克出了什么问题
If something goes wrong between me and Mike,

73
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,350
我会得到保护  因为迈克不会
I will be taken care of, because Mike wouldn't--

74
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,180
-这可说不准  -你不了解迈克
- You don't know that. - You don't know Mike.

75
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,290
你说得对  我是不了解  所以我才起草了协议
You're right, I don't, which is why I had that drawn up,

76
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,450
你至少可以把它带回家看一看
and the least you could do is take it home and look it over.

77
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,850
好吧
Fine.

78
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,060
现在我们能享受余下的晚餐时光了吗
Now, can we enjoy the rest of our dinner together?

79
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,710
尽量吧
We can try.

80
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,600
大迈克
Big Mike.

81
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,290
-太久没见了  -太久了
- It's been too long. - Too long.

82
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,380
也许我们都太忙于
Guess we're just too busy

83
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,260
在牛逼律所当牛逼助理律师了
being kickass associates at kickass law firms.

84
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,330
我不知道你怎样  但我有时候牛逼
I don't know about you, but some days I kick ass...

85
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,440
有时候
And some days...

86
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,760
有时候傻逼
You get your ass kicked.

87
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,620
好了  迈克  有什么重要消息
Okay, Mike, so what is this big news?

88
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,490
你是以最快速成为初级合伙人了吗
You the fastest person ever to make it to junior partner?

89
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,170
-更好  我订婚了  -不是吧
- Better. I got engaged. - No shit.

90
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,060
是的
Yes shit.

91
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,450
她从哪个国家来
Well, what country is she from?

92
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,950
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

93
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,660
我猜她应该是个邮寄新娘
Well, I'm assuming she's a mail-order bride.

94
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,520
好吧
Okay.

95
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,590
是瑞秋・赞恩
It's Rachel Zane.

96
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,420
-真的吗  -真的
- Damn. - Mm-hmm.

97
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,120
祝贺你  伙计
Congratulations, bro.

98
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,780
说真的  你真的是中了头彩
Seriously, you hit the jackpot with that one.

99
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,690
谢谢  吉米
Thank you, Jimmy.

100
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,220
等等  哈罗德知道吗
Wait--wait a second, does Harold know?

101
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,050
不知道  所以我才叫你们过来
No, that's why I brought you guys down here.

102
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,750
好吧  那你知道他非常喜欢她吧
Okay. You do know he has a huge crush on her, right?

103
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,120
-多喜欢  -迈克  行了吧
- How huge? - Mike, come on.

104
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,680
我们说的是哈罗德  你认为呢
We're talking about Harold here. What do you think?

105
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
-糟了  -伙计们  大家都好呀
- Oh, shit. - Hey, bros, what's the haps?

106
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,270
-你好  -你好
- Hey. - Hey.

107
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,490
我来告诉你发生了什么事  哈罗德
I will tell you the haps, Harold.

108
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,160
-你记得瑞秋・赞恩吗  -当然记得了
- Do you remember Rachel Zane? - Uh, yeah, of course.

109
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,390
我现在还每天查看她的脸书页面十来次
I still check her Facebook page, like, ten times a day.

110
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,170
怎么了  她出什么事了吗
Why? Did something bad happen to her?

111
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,580
如果我是她  我确实认为这事很糟
Well, if I was her, I would think it was bad.

112
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,950
事实上  是糟透了
In fact, I'd think it really sucked.

113
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,380
瑞秋和我订婚了
Rachel and I got engaged.

114
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,620
那太好了
Oh, that's amazing.

115
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,560
我太为你高兴了
I am so happy for you, man. Wow.

116
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,970
真的吗  你看起来不高兴
Really? 'Cause you sure don't look happy.

117
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,580
吉米  你去给哈罗德拿杯喝的吧
Hey, Jimmy, why don't you go get Harold a drink?

118
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,400
-我不去怎么样  -等等  迈克
- Why don't I don't? - Wait a second, Mike.

119
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,030
你记得那次我在档案室
Do you remember that time when I walked in on you

120
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,600
碰到你和唐娜・鲍尔森
and Donna Paulsen in the file room,

121
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,970
而她跪在地上
and she was on her knees?

122
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,430
说实话吧  我们都知道发生了什么
Let's be honest, we all know what was going on there.

123
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,860
瑞秋知道这事吗
Does Rachel know about that?

124
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,000
她不仅知道  而且完全接受
Not only does she know, she's totally fine with it.

125
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,510
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

126
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,250
你真是全世界最幸运的人
You are the luckiest man in the entire freaking world.

127
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,520
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

128
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,860
气死我了  我需要找个服务员
Pissing me off. I need my waitress.

129
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,500
-得来杯迈泰鸡尾酒 -恩  去找她吧
- I need a Mai Tai. - Yeah, go get her.

130
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,870
迈泰酒  他需要的是跟女人滚床单
Mai Tai? He needs some sex from a woman.

131
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,910
我想咖啡没有给我的
I don't suppose one of those would be for me.

132
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,710
就算有  我猜你也不想要
I don't think you'd want it if it was.

133
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,910
因为路易喜欢加六块糖
Louis likes six sugars.

134
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,030
肯定的
Of course he does.

135
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,380
我听说你今天上午要给接替我的人面试
I hear you're interviewing replacements this morning.

136
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,360
没错
I am.

137
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,970
杰克・索罗夫
Jack Soloff.

138
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,510
你来我这干什么
What brings you to my neck of the woods?

139
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,450
为见你
You do.

140
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,020
是不是跟
Oh, does this have anything to do

141
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,240
杰西卡不参加明天的合伙人会议有关系
with Jessica not being at the partners meeting tomorrow?

142
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,940
当然
It sure does.

143
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,550
那我比你行动早多了  她不明白
Oh, well, then I'm way ahead of you. She doesn't get it.

144
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,330
我们必须在男洗手间装通风设备
We need ventilation in the men's bathroom.

145
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,930
今天早上  我在尼尔・斯维邱之后进去
I was in there after Neil Sweetzer this morning,

146
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,690
我的双眼差点从脸上融化掉
and my eyes, they nearly melted off my face.

147
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,340
那确实是个问题
That is a problem.

148
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,610
但不是我来找你的原因
Not why I'm here.

149
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,830
我是想更改公司的薪金方案
I'd like to alter the firm's compensation formula.

150
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,760
好吧杰克  听着  我知道
Okay, Jack, look, I know that

151
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,500
我知道你是薪金委员会的新任领导
you're the new head of the compensation committee,

152
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,990
-我觉得这不是好主意  -薪水应该
- but I don't think that's a good idea. - Salaries should be

153
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,230
更多地取决于小时佣金收入而不是胜诉酬金
weighted more towards billables than contingent compensation.

154
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,080
你觉得呢
What do you think about that?

155
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,770
我觉得这对哈维的薪水影响最大
I think that affects Harvey's salary more than anyone else's.

156
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,600
是吗
Would it?

157
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,380
-我没注意到  -胡扯
- Hadn't realized. - Bullshit.

158
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,100
你在利用职权向哈维发难
You're using your position to take on Harvey.

159
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,060
想扬名立万总得找人发难
Hey, you don't make a name for yourself taking on nobody.

160
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,440
你愿意我找上你吗
Would you rather it be you?

161
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,250
你在威胁我吗
You threatening me?

162
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,930
我为什么要威胁你
Why would I do that?

163
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,150
路易  你是冠名合伙人  因为你劳苦功高
Louis, you're a name partner. Got there by being a grinder.

164
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,730
劳苦功高的人分得更大的利益
It's only fair that the grinders of this firm

165
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,250
才算公平
got a bigger piece of the pie.

166
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,060
另外  杰西卡不会
On top of that, Jessica's not gonna be

167
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,050
出席明天的会议
at the meeting tomorrow.

168
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,420
天赐良机
Timing couldn't be better.

169
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,690
你提案吧
You know what? Bring it up.

170
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,420
谢谢  路易
Thank you, Louis.

171
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,370
怎么回事
What was that?

172
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,530
-什么怎么回事  -那个
- What was what? - That.

173
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,680
那是杰克・索罗夫想让我批准他提出提案
That was Jack Soloff wanting to run his proposal by me.

174
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,830
是的  一个为了给哈维减薪的鬼提案
Yeah. A bullshit proposal designed to cut Harvey's salary.

175
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,070
你又要跟他斗
You're picking a fight with him.

176
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,690
我没有
No, I'm not.

177
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,990
我让在会上他提出这个提案
I'm letting him bring up his proposal at the meeting,

178
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,570
这样我就可以否决它
so I can smack it down.

179
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,910
为什么要这么做
Why would you do that?

180
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,640
因为我看到哈维的眼神
Because I saw the look on Harvey's face.

181
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,750
他嫉妒我们
He's jealous of us,

182
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,920
而我希望有机会公开支持他
and I want the chance to back him publicly.

183
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,310
路易  哈维也许对我们很不爽
Louis, Harvey might be upset about us,

184
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,800
但鼓励别人阴他
but encouraging people to go after him

185
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,410
就为了你能支持他  绝对是个大错误
just so you can have his back is a huge mistake.

186
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,370
你在米尔斯顿・斯维工作了七年
You were at Millstein Swain for seven years.

187
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,950
艾伦・斯维退休后  我决定换个东家
When Ellen Swain retired, I decided it was time to move on.

188
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,650
为什么不找律所的其他合伙人
Why not go to another partner in the firm?

189
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,290
因为我觉得其他合伙人
Because I didn't think any of the other partners

190
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,360
不够好
were good enough.

191
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,080
我感谢你的诚实
I appreciate the honesty.

192
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,090
我也感谢你第一个叫我进来
And I appreciate being the first person you called in,

193
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,950
如果你真想传闻中说的善于识人
and if you're as good at reading people as they say,

194
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,570
我也会是最后一个进来的人
I'll also be the last.

195
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,390
-真的吗  -你可以试试
- Is that a fact? - Call anyone you want.

196
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,860
我是法律秘书中的迪昂・桑德斯[橄榄球星]
I'm the Deion Sanders of legal secretaries.

197
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,270
-迪昂・桑德斯  -我办事动作快
- Deion Sanders? - I'm quick on my feet.

198
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,700
知道如何阻止问题发生
I know how to intercept a problem.

199
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,150
是的  但是迪昂・桑德斯
Yeah, but Deion Sanders?

200
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,430
如果你想换个时代  那我是迪克・巴克斯[老一代球星]
If you prefer another era, Dick Butkus.

201
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,090
总之  无人能出我之右
Either way, no one gets by me.

202
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,340
你看上去可不像迪克・巴克斯
You don't look like Dick Butkus.

203
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,410
确实不像
No, I don't.

204
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,040
谢谢  阿比盖尔  我会联系你的
Well, thanks, Abigail. I'll be in touch.

205
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,580
你
You.

206
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,480
你当法律秘书多久了
How long have you been a legal secretary?

207
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,820
到春天就二十四年了
24 years this spring.

208
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,970
-你干得好吗  -我干得很好
- You good at what you do? - I'm great at what I do.

209
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,730
那你明天开始上班
Then you start tomorrow.

210
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,370
你觉得怎么样
Well, what do you think?

211
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,840
-十二码吗  -必须是
- Size 12? - You know it.

212
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,140
我觉得棒极了
Then I think they're awesome.

213
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,600
你不会专门为了给我看鞋
You didn't come all the way down here

214
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,860
大老远跑来这里的
to give me your new shoe.

215
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,650
我告诉过你上百遍了
And I'm telling you for the hundredth time,

216
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,490
迈克尔不会离开耐克的
Michael is not leaving Nike.

217
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,450
这是我第一次  不是为了迈克尔而来
And for the first time, I'm not here about Michael.

218
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,630
阿迪达斯刚给我开出了一亿美元的价钱
Adidas just made me an offer for $100 million.

219
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,860
阿迪达斯可以去死了
Adidas can go to hell.

220
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,900
因为那只是你公司市值的三分之一
That's 1/3 of what your company's worth.

221
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,950
-哈维  我想接受  -什么
- Harvey, I want to take it. - What?

222
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,090
我不会让你这么干的
I'm not letting you do that.

223
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,350
我不是在求你许可
I'm not asking for your permission.

224
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,850
我不管  反正我不会让你
And I don't give a shit-- I'm not letting you sell

225
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,550
廉价把公司卖了
your company for pennies on the dollar.

226
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,910
你为什么要这么干
Where the hell is this coming from?

227
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,500
因为人生苦短
It's coming from the fact that life is short,

228
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,600
我累了  我准备好要向前看了
I'm burnt out, and I'm ready to move on.

229
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,650
人生苦短
Life is short?

230
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,420
这就是你不肯深思熟虑这件事的原因吗
That's your reason for not thinking this through?

231
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,440
我不想深思熟虑
I don't want to think it through.

232
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,210
我怕深思熟虑之后我会改变主意
I might change my mind and not do it at all.

233
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,880
好吧  泰迪  你想卖公司
Okay, Teddy, you want to sell?

234
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,530
那就卖  但我们白手起家建立了这家公司
Sell, but we built this company from the ground up.

235
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,160
给我一周时间帮你搞个更好的价钱
Give me a week to get you a better offer.

236
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,250
我给你的时间  与他们给我的时间一样
I'll give you the same thing they're giving me.

237
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,540
四十八小时
48 hours.

238
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,690
就这么定了
Then I'll take it.

239
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,860
顺便问一句  唐哪呢
By the way, where's Donna?

240
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,810
-她向前看了  -看
- She moved on. - You see?

241
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,050
这就是我所说的
That's what I'm talking about.

242
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,740
人生苦短
Life is short.

243
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,250
唐娜另谋高就
Donna moved on to something better.

244
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,850
她不是另谋高就
She didn't move on to something better.

245
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,520
什么意思
What do you mean?

246
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,760
她去为路易工作了
She's working for Louis.

247
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,600
利特吗  出什么事了
Litt? What the hell happened?

248
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,730
没出什么事
Nothing happened.

249
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,050
只是到了需要变动一下的时候
Just time for a change.

250
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,090
她去给那混蛋工作  肯定是出什么事了
If she's working for that asshole, something happened.

251
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,280
泰迪  你说你知道应该在什么时候做出改变
Teddy, you say you know when it's time to move on,

252
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,670
现在就是应该改变话题的时候了
it's time to move on from this topic right now.

253
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,100
好吧  哈维
Okay, Harvey.

254
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,450
我只是说外面那位大妈可替代不了唐娜
All I'm saying is Mrs. Keebler out there ain't no Donna.

255
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,960
连着两天见面
Twice in two days?

256
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,460
人们会说我们闲话的
People are gonna get the wrong idea.

257
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,080
他们爱怎么想怎么想
Well, they can think what they're gonna think,

258
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,830
但那可阻止不了我来给我的好兄弟
but it's not going to stop me from giving my boy

259
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,370
送订婚礼物
an engagement gift.

260
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,760
-你要给我一个案子  -不是随便一个案子
- You're giving me a case? - It's not just any case.

261
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,060
这正对你的胃口  行善做好事
This is right up your alley. Do-gooder lane.

262
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,170
-好吧  -听我说  迈克
- All right. - Listen, Mike.

263
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,040
这些人遇到不公正对待的唯一原因就是
These people got the shaft for one reason.

264
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,290
他们是穷人  没人在乎他们
They're poor, and no one gives a shit about 'em.

265
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,180
他们需要一个英雄  你就是那个英雄
They need a hero, and you're that guy.

266
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,890
你为什么不能当那个英雄
Why aren't you that guy?

267
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,170
我就是个英雄
Oh, I am that guy,

268
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,440
但你是那个马上要娶瑞秋・赞恩的人
but you're the one getting married to Rachel Zane.

269
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,220
差点害我被解雇的那个瑞秋・赞恩
The same Rachel Zane that I almost got fired,

270
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,050
然后你却给了我第二次机会
and then you gave me a second chance.

271
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,550
所以这就是你补偿我的方法吗
So this is your way of making it up to me?

272
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,590
听我说  迈克  和原告们谈谈
Listen, Mike, talk to the plaintiffs,

273
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,600
我保证  听完他们的故事
listen to their stories, and I promise you

274
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,200
一定会让你那颗悲天悯人的小心脏流泪的
it'll break your little bleeding heart.

275
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,010
谢谢你  吉米
Thank you, Jimmy.

276
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,220
不用谢
Yeah, you bet.

277
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,630
如果杰西卡不同意我办这个案子怎么办
What if I can't get Jessica to sign off?

278
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,830
那我就把这个案子拿回去
Then I'll just take the case back

279
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,510
改送你套酒具什么的
and get you a decanter or some shit.

280
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,160
所以大家都一致同意
So it's unanimous.

281
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,100
从今天开始  所有初年律师都必须
From now on, all first-years are required

282
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,300
达到两千八百个小时的计费工作时间
to bill 2,800 hours

283
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,750
而且还得自己带午饭
and bring their own lunches.

284
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,010
恭喜啊  路易
Congratulations, Louis, 

285
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,980
新一代律师又乖乖被你压迫了
another generation of associates smacked into submission.

286
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,780
现在  恕我失陪
Now, if you'll excuse me,

287
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,220
我想这次会议我已经开完了
I think I'm done with this meeting.

288
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,410
哈维  拜托  我们还有新事项要谈
Harvey, please, we still have new business.

289
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,220
说到这个  我想提议
Speaking of which, I'd like to propose a change

290
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,270
对当前的薪酬计算方法进行调整
to the current compensation formula.

291
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,940
你说什么
Excuse me?

292
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,640
自从接管委员会以来
Well, since taking over the committee,

293
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,680
我仔细查看了我们的薪资结构
I've been evaluating pay structures,

294
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,730
我认为现在是时候
and I think it's high time that this firm

295
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,090
提高我们律所计时收费的权重了
put a larger emphasis on billable hours.

296
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,550
你还是好好管好你自己的事吧  杰克
Why don't you stick to the 48th floor, Jack?

297
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,110
看来你对我的提议有意见
I take it you have a problem with my proposal.

298
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,340
当然有意见
You're damn right I do.

299
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,280
我刚接手一件公司出售的案子
I just took on the sale of a man's company,

300
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,790
我的佣金完全是按合同比例收取的
and my entire fee is contingent-based.

301
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,750
因为你总是自行其是
Because you operate as your own entity,

302
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,680
而我们其他人却在为律所这个团队合作努力
while the rest of us are members of a team known as this firm.

303
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,860
不  是因为我为这个律所
No, because I bring in

304
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,650
带来了大笔的收入
a truckload of money for this firm.

305
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,760
就像我说的  哈维・斯佩克特永远都搞特例
Well, like I said, special rules for Harvey Specter.

306
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,160
好了  杰克  够了
You know what, Jack? That's enough.

307
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,330
现行薪资体系运行得很好
The current system works fine,

308
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,170
而且我不认为你应该用这样不尊重得口气
and I don't appreciate you speaking to Harvey

309
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,350
和哈维说话
in such a disrespectful manner.

310
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,810
-你耍我吗  -哈维  我很抱歉
- Are you shitting me? - Harvey, I'm sorry.

311
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,880
省了你的抱歉吧  路易  这次会议结束
Save your sorries, Louis. This meeting's over.

312
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,590
哈维  听我说  我可站在你这一边
Harvey, listen. I'm on your side.

313
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,190
是  我不用你站在我这一边  好吗
Yeah. I don't need you on my side, okay?

314
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,320
-我还有事忙  -等等
- I have shit to do. - Wait.

315
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,850
我还没说我的提案呢
I haven't even brought up my proposal yet

316
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,770
关于男厕所的那个
for the men's bathroom.

317
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,310
你想继续享受临时称霸王的感觉
You want to finish being king for a day?

318
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,450
随便你
Be my guest.

319
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,820
喝着你那加了五十块糖的咖啡
Enjoy your coffee and your 50 sugars,

320
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,600
尽情享受去吧  但我说了我还有事要忙
and go for it, but like I said, I have shit to do.

321
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,560
斯坦利是个好人
Stanley was a good man.

322
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,790
从没旷过一天工
Never missed a day of work,

323
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,600
努力赚钱养家
provided for his family.

324
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,410
他不应该落得这样的下场
He didn't deserve what happened to him.

325
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,600
具体发生了什么事
What did happen?

326
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,270
我告诉过另一个律师
Like I told the other lawyer,

327
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,060
他因为胸疼去医院看病
he went to the hospital with chest pains.

328
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,930
他们说他没事
They said it was nothing.

329
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,290
他还是一直喊疼
He kept complaining.

330
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,260
斯坦利从来不喊疼
Stanley never complained.

331
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,990
两天后他们让他出院了
Two days later they released him.

332
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,040
那天晚上斯坦利回到家睡觉
Stanley went to sleep in our bed that night.

333
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,780
然后就再也没醒过来
And he never woke up.

334
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,660
是的
No.

335
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,560
他再也没醒过来
He didn't.

336
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,790
你确定医院让他出院
Are you sure the hospital released him

337
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,070
是因为保险公司缩短了他的留院观察期吗
because the insurance company cut his stay?

338
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,010
他明明生病了  罗斯先生
He was sick, Mr. Ross,

339
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,180
他们却让他回家
and they just sent him home.

340
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,970
还有两百多个人
There are over 200 other people

341
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,310
都和他遭遇了同样的命运
who had the exact same thing happen to them.

342
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,370
你觉得这会是巧合吗
You think that's a coincidence?

343
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,440
不  我不这样认为
No, I don't,

344
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,570
所以我才在考虑复查这个案子
which is why I'm considering reopening this case.

345
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,810
那你还犹豫什么呢
So what's stopping you?

346
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,900
首先
Well, for one thing,

347
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,720
我想知道你之前的律师为什么要退出
I want to know why your other lawyer dropped out.

348
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,890
因为他们用尽各种手段对付他
Because they worked that man to the bone.

349
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,260
他差点失去自己的律所
He almost lost his entire practice,

350
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,630
但我听说你背后有一个强大有实力的律所支撑
but I was told that you're with a big, powerful firm.

351
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,730
是的
I am...

352
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,090
但我不确定我能说服他们
but I don't know if I'm gonna be able to 

353
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,580
同意接手这个案子
get them to sign off on this.

354
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,120
那我们该怎么办
So what are we supposed to do?

355
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,480
你只要安心等待就行
You're supposed to sit tight.

356
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,300
-那是怎么回事  -你在说什么
- What the hell was that? - What are you talking about?

357
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,050
你心里清楚我在说什么
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

358
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,100
你在会上拂袖而去
You stormed out of the meeting

359
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,260
我们应该一起主持
that we were supposed to run together.

360
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,890
我没有冲出去  我走了出去
I didn't storm out, I walked out

361
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,730
因为你主持得烂透了
because you were doing a shitty job running it.

362
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,120
你在说些什么  我一直在支持你
What are you talking about? I had your back.

363
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,510
在你让那个小丑企图裁减我的薪水之后
After you let that clown come after my salary.

364
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,700
我没让他做任何事
I didn't let him do anything.

365
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,150
我力挺了你  然而你羞辱了我
I defended you, and then you smack me down,

366
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,030
然后我不得不推迟了一个
after which I had to postpone a presentation

367
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,550
我本来满腔热情想做的陈述
that I was very passionate about.

368
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,470
这是个洗手间  有时有味道是正常的
It's a bathroom, Louis. It smells sometimes.

369
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,820
你为什么不进去
So why don't you just go in there,

370
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,890
做人们正常人做的事  从我面前消失呢
do what people do in there, and get out of my face?

371
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,230
你知道吗  唐娜说得对
You know what? Donna was right.

372
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,080
我就不该尝试与你重修于好
I should have never tried to make things right with you.

373
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,970
-和我重修于好  -是的  哈维
- Make things right with me? - Yeah, Harvey.

374
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,980
我让杰克那样做  可以让他清楚自己的身份
I let Jack do that so that I could put him in his place

375
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,540
并向你证明我会支持你  但你意识不到
and show you that I had your back, but you can't see it

376
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,700
因为你太嫉妒我和唐娜了
because you're too damn jealous of me and Donna.

377
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,940
-你刚刚对我说什么  -你在嫉妒
- What did you just say to me? - You're jealous.

378
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,140
你知道吗  路易
You know what, Louis,

379
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,530
如果我真的对你们俩那么不满
if I was so upset about the two of you,

380
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,770
为什么我还在付她薪水
why am I still paying her salary?

381
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,290
扯淡  律所付她薪水
Bullshit. The firm pays her salary.

382
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,520
不是全部
Not all of it.

383
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,070
我把她从地检办公室带来的时候
You see, when I brought her over here from the DA's office,

384
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,240
杰西卡不肯雇用她  因为我只是个初级律师
Jessica wouldn't hire her because I was an associate,

385
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,790
所以我付她薪水
so I paid her salary.

386
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,440
我当上合伙人以后
And then I made partner,

387
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,650
我觉得她薪水不够高  所以我给她涨了薪
and I didn't think it was enough, so I paid her more.

388
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,580
一次又一次
And again and again and again.

389
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,360
所以我受够了你说我嫉妒
So I've had enough of you telling me I'm jealous.

390
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,950
唐娜不再为你工作了
Yeah, well, Donna doesn't work for you anymore.

391
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,290
她为我工作
She works for me, and the only person

392
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,430
这位  将是唯一会支付她薪水的人
who's gonna be taking care of her salary--this guy.

393
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,850
-你听见了没  -我不介意
- You got that? - Fine by me.

394
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,190
但你夸下海口前
But before you say that,

395
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,370
最好搞清楚你给自己揽下了什么
you better know what you're getting yourself into.

396
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,100
我当然知道我揽下了什么
Oh, yeah, I know what I'm getting myself into,

397
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,380
因为那样的女人是不能用金钱衡量价值的
because you can't put a price tag on a woman like that.

398
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,440
我要跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

399
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,600
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

400
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,410
你在洗手间和哈维聊了几句
You got into a pissing contest with Harvey,

401
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,660
他告诉你他在支付唐娜的薪水
he told you he's been covering Donna's salary,

402
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,980
你  自尊心作祟  承诺你会接过这一职责  
you, out of pride, said that you were going to take it on,

403
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,700
现在你来打探你掉进了多大的坑
and now you're here to find out how much you're on the hook for.

404
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,030
-完全不是这样  -好极了
- Nothing like that. - Oh, good.

405
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,370
-那是什么事  -以上你所说的全部内容
- Then what is it? - Everything you just said.

406
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,330
-路易  -杰西卡  求你了
- Louis-- - Jessica, please.

407
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,950
-我就想看一眼数额  -好吧  路易
- I just want to see the number. - Okay, Louis.

408
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,230
你想看数额  给你
You want to see the number? Here's the number.

409
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,920
谢...  你妹啊
Thank y-- holy goddamn shit.

410
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,720
你确定没有不小心多加了个零吗
Are you sure you didn't accidentally add a zero?

411
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,830
我很确定
Yes, I'm sure.

412
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,730
律所能不能
Is there any way the firm can--

413
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,620
律所是不会多付她的
The firm is not going to pick this up.

414
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,790
哈维知道这一点  但依旧选择多付她薪水
Harvey knew that, and he chose to pay her more anyway.

415
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,940
那我要怎么办
What the hell am I supposed to do?

416
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,500
在我看来你有两个选择
Well, it seems to me you have two options:

417
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,900
你可以告诉唐娜哈维一直在补贴她的薪水
You can tell Donna that Harvey's been augmenting her salary,

418
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,990
但你不想继续这么做
and you don't want to do it anymore.

419
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,120
-不行  -或者你可以自己承担她的薪水
- Negatory. - Or you can pay it yourself.

420
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,870
-不可能  -还有第三个选择
- Not happening. - There is a third option.

421
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,750
我可以把她派还给哈维
I can send her back to Harvey.

422
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,310
你敢
How dare you?

423
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,520
什么叫我没法儿变现
What do you mean I'm not liquid?

424
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,370
谁喊你只留百分之十的现金的
Who told you to only save 10% cash?

425
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,550
我不管我说了什么
Well, I don't care what I said.

426
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,780
我说我有槌状脚趾的时候
Does my podiatrist listen to me

427
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,230
我的足病医生听我的了吗
when I tell him I have hammertoe?

428
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,240
一切都顺利吗  路易
Is everything okay, Louis?

429
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,390
-好极了  -好的
- Everything's wonderful. - Okay.

430
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,360
实际上  我突然想起来
Actually, it occurred to me

431
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,270
我们还没有讨论过一个很重要的议题
that we have not discussed a very important subject.

432
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,260
什么
What is it?

433
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,270
唐娜  钱是个很敏感的话题
Donna, money's a very sensitive issue.

434
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,990
我觉得你应该得到合理的报酬
And I think you should be fairly compensated.

435
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,080
我知道你为了我离开哈维是个艰难的决定
I mean, I know how hard it was for you to leave Harvey for me,

436
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,660
我永远都会心存感激
and I am forever grateful.

437
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,240
-只是我  -路易
- It's just that I-- - Louis, shh.

438
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,880
我不需要大幅涨薪
I don't need a huge raise.

439
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,710
标准的百分之二已经足够了
The standard 2% is more than enough.

440
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,080
-百分之二  -是的
- 2%? - Yes.

441
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,670
你很慷慨
You have a huge heart,

442
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,380
但我的薪水已经比律所其他秘书
but I already make more than every other secretary

443
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,460
都要高了  所以
at the firm, so--

444
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,950
-那就百分之二  -谢谢  路易
- 2% it is. - Thanks, Louis.

445
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,250
别客气
Don't mention it.

446
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,000
你现在有空吗
Hey, do you have a second?

447
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,740
我需要你的法律建议
I need your legal advice about something.

448
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,990
当然  什么事
Yeah, of course. What is it?

449
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,520
我的未婚妻把这份婚前协议落在厨房了
My fiance left this prenup in the kitchen.

450
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,120
你觉得我应不应该签字
I'm just wondering if you think I should sign it.

451
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,410
迈克  这不是看上去那样
Mike, it's not what it looks like.

452
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,550
看上去你父亲给你准备了一份婚前协议
It looks like your father had a prenup prepared

453
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,980
让我签字
for you to make me sign.

454
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,440
那么就是看上去那样
Then it's exactly what it looks like.

455
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,120
我猜你不想让我签字
And I'm guessing you don't want me to sign it?

456
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,190
不  我不想
No, I don't,

457
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,430
因为他总是想控制我的人生
because he's been trying to control me my entire life,

458
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,160
这次我不会让他这么做的
and I'm not gonna let him do that with this.

459
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,550
你有没有想过
Has it occurred to you

460
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,480
你父亲这么做只是因为爱你
that maybe your father is only doing this because he loves you?

461
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,950
我不在乎他为什么这么做
I don't really care why he's doing it.

462
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,120
好的婚姻不是从协议开始的
Great marriages don't start with contracts.

463
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,790
-我知道  -那你干嘛来拷问我
- I know that. - Then why are you grilling me?

464
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,790
因为你不告诉我这件事是有原因的
Because there's a reason that you didn't tell me about this,

465
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,500
我想知道是什么
and I need to know what it is.

466
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,380
我父亲说他不了解
My dad said he doesn't know the man

467
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,930
我想要嫁的这个人
that I'm choosing to marry,

468
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,340
我就是
and I just--

469
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,680
我不想对你说这些
I didn't want to tell you that.

470
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,980
-但我还是知道了  -是啊
- Well, I found out anyway. - Yeah.

471
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,110
瑞秋  以后
Rachel, in the future,

472
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,150
我希望你能
I want you to feel comfortable 

473
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,760
放心地跟我说这些事
telling me this stuff in the first place.

474
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,860
我会的
I will.

475
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,490
斯佩克特先生  我想...
Mr. Specter, I wanted to--

476
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,550
你还没下班吗
You're still here?

477
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,320
你不下班我是不会下班的
I don't leave until you leave.

478
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,280
好吧  我和阿迪达斯的会面是几点
Well, in that case, what time is my meeting with Adidas?

479
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,200
11:15
11:15.

480
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,370
我把十一点的行程挪到下午三点
I moved your 11:00 to 3:00

481
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,560
三点的挪到了五点
and your 3:00 to 5:00.

482
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,720
-安排好...  -买家吗
- Did you line up-- - Buyers?

483
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,330
好了  但还需要一个星期
I did but not for another week.

484
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,050
耐克和彪马在海外
Nike and Puma are overseas,

485
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,100
你说过如果其他两家不能去
and you said Reebok didn't matter

486
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
锐步一家于事无补
if the other two can't be there.

487
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,450
该死
God damn it.

488
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,300
-还有一件事  -有区别吗
- There's one more thing. - What difference does it make?

489
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,950
不知道我的客户为什么一时兴起要卖公司
I can't delay the sale if I don't know

490
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,040
就不能拖延交易
why my client is dumping his company on a whim.

491
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,500
我要说的就是这件事
That's the one more thing.

492
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,240
道尔先生的挚友
Mr. Doyle's best friend died

493
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,120
一个月前因患胰腺癌去世了
a month ago of pancreatic cancer.

494
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,550
才46岁
He was 46.

495
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,720
你怎么知道
How'd you know that?

496
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,440
他在说我坏话之前
Something he said to you just before 

497
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,510
跟你说的话
he started talking shit about me

498
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,560
让我很在意
stuck in my head.

499
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,780
什么话
What exactly was that?

500
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,840
当一个人在半分钟内两次说到"生命短暂"
When people say "Life is short" two times in 30 seconds,

501
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,710
一般是在某人去世以后
it's usually right after somebody died.

502
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,850
这么说你在听我们谈话
I take it you were listening to our conversation.

503
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,330
优秀的秘书都这么做
That's what good secretaries do.

504
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,350
-抱歉取笑了你  -又不是你说的
- Sorry about the Keebler thing. - You didn't say it.

505
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,670
而且  不是非得爱因斯坦才能弄清楚
Besides, it doesn't take Albert Einstein to figure out

506
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,250
你为什么会雇佣我这种丑八怪
why you hired somebody that look like me

507
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,800
来代替她那种美人
to replace somebody that look like her.

508
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,780
听着  格蕾琴  我...
Listen, Gretchen, I--

509
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,230
你不用跟我解释
You don't have to worry about that with me.

510
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,880
我喜欢我的男人爷们儿点
I prefer my men manly.

511
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,630
我不够爷们儿吗
Am I not manly?

512
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,080
你连这问题都得问的话...
Well, if you have to ask...

513
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,460
迈克  你好啊
Mike, how you doing?

514
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,300
罗伯特
Robert.

515
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,530
有事吗
What can I do for you?

516
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,330
我听说你想要我签署婚前协议
I heard you wanted me to sign a prenup.

517
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,240
没错
I did.

518
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,090
希望你别当我是针对你
I hope you didn't take it personally.

519
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,670
当然不会  我很愿意签
Of course not, I'm happy to sign it,

520
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,060
但是瑞秋说你不知道
but Rachel did say that you don't know

521
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,620
我是什么样的人
what kind of guy I am,

522
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,650
所以我觉得应该过来让你看看
so I thought I'd come here to show you that

523
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,900
这就是我的为人
this is the kind of guy I am.

524
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,700
你要对付凯尔顿保险公司
You're going after Kelton Insurance?

525
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,190
重要的不是我要对付谁
It's not about who I'm going after.

526
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,620
而是我要代表谁
It's about who I'm representing.

527
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,090
我要冒险为这二百人打官司
I'm putting my ass on the line for 200 people

528
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,720
除了我  没人愿意为他们做主
who have no one to fight for them other than me,

529
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,820
如果你担心一旦出了意外
so if you're worried that I'd go after Rachel's money

530
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,080
我会谋取瑞秋的钱
if something went wrong--

531
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,540
你不是那种人
You're not that type of guy.

532
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,740
不  我不是
No, I'm not.

533
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,110
我很钦佩
I respect that.

534
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,810
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

535
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,020
但让我告诉你件事
But let me tell you something.

536
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,940
我也曾是那些人中的一员
I used to be one of those people,

537
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,510
我摸爬滚打混到今天的地位
and I scratched and clawed my way to where I am today,

538
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,800
所以我清楚
which is why I know

539
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,060
当你从一无所有  变得有所成就
when you come from nothing and you make yourself into something, 

540
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,240
你就总是等待着
you're always waiting for the day 

541
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,840
别人会来把它取走的那天
they're gonna come and take it away.

542
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,720
我要告诉你  我也曾经一无所有
I'm telling you that I come from nothing,

543
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,460
我永远不会那么做
and I would never do that.

544
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,960
我不是说你会这么做
I'm not saying you're gonna take it.

545
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,520
我是说你会做某些事情
I'm saying you might do something

546
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,960
其他人会因此针对你
that makes someone else take it.

547
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,340
什么意思
What do you mean?

548
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,070
你在哈维・斯佩克特和杰西卡・皮尔逊的
You're learning at the feet of Harvey Specter

549
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,460
身边学习
and Jessica Pearson,

550
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,740
他们和我都清楚一件事
and they know something I know.

551
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,330
你会成为一名优秀的律师
You're gonna be a great lawyer.

552
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,750
你是做大事的人
You're gonna crack some eggs,

553
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,900
你永远不知道什么时候  会有人因为你做的事
and you never know when someone's gonna come at you

554
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,000
拿走属于你的东西
to take what's yours for something you did.

555
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,030
-罗伯特  我永远不会...  -让我说完
- Robert, I would never-- - Let me finish.

556
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,800
我跟你说这些  是因为你就要成为我的家人
I'm telling you this because you're gonna be family.

557
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,560
你也许还没越线  但总有一天会的
You might not have crossed any lines yet, but you will.

558
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,700
我只是想保护我的女儿
I'm just trying to protect my baby girl.

559
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,070
杰西卡  你想见我
Jessica, you wanted to see me?

560
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,480
其实是路易想见我们两个
Actually, Louis wants to see both of us.

561
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,900
那就有事说事吧
Then let's get it over with.

562
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,030
好的
Okay.

563
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,900
我想提议
I would like to propose

564
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,470
依照以下方针
a revamping of the pay structure

565
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,070
调整薪金结构
under the following guidelines.

566
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,830
我们提高合伙人的小时佣金抽成
We increase the percentage of billables the partners get.

567
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,010
通过抵消量来降低
We decrease the percentage of contingent fees

568
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,470
-胜诉酬金的抽成  -什么
- by an offsetting amount. - What?

569
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,390
这不是杰克・索罗夫昨天的提案吗
That's what Jack Soloff said yesterday.

570
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,200
不  这个不同
No, this is different.

571
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,730
我给合伙人的工资变动加了上限
I've capped the amount it affects any one partner.

572
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,630
你扯淡吧
You got to be shitting me.

573
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,680
我知道你们想知道我为什么这么提议
I know you're wondering why I'm proposing this.

574
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,900
理由清楚得很
It's crystal clear why you're proposing it.

575
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,470
你涨的工资刚好够付唐娜的薪水
You get the exact amount to cover Donna's salary,

576
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,700
还是从我这里刮来的钱
and you take it out of my paycheck.

577
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,220
-路易  -这和那事没关系
- Louis-- - This has nothing to do with that.

578
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,330
杰克的主意很棒
Jack had a great idea.

579
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,440
只是需要轻微调整
It just needed some fine-tuning.

580
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,370
轻微调整  是你说
Fine-tuning? You're the one that said

581
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,600
你让他提出来
you only let him bring it up

582
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,160
只是为了毙掉它
so that you can smack it down.

583
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,070
是真的吗
Is that true?

584
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,680
是  大概吧  但我考虑了一下
Yes. Maybe, but I had some time to think about it.

585
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,890
杰克提了建议
Jack put something on the table,

586
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,410
实现它是我们的责任
and it's our duty to follow through on it.

587
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,360
扯淡  你想实现它
Oh, bullshit--you're only following through on it

588
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,980
因为你是个狗娘养的小气鬼
because you're a cheap son of a bitch.

589
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,570
-哈维  -我不想听  杰西卡
- Harvey. - I don't want to hear it, Jessica.

590
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,810
昨天  他说我嫉妒他
Yesterday, he accused me of being jealous.

591
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,090
今天  他又想抢我的钱
Today, he's coming after my money.

592
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,490
-我没有  -闭嘴
- No, I'm not-- - Shut up.

593
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,340
我们都清楚唐娜去为你工作
We both know Donna going to work for you

594
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,560
不是因为你
has nothing to do with you.

595
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,000
-你走运而已  -走运
- You got lucky. - Lucky?

596
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,710
就像中彩票的猴子一样
Like a monkey who won the lottery,

597
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,310
所以你至少可以男人点  自己付账
so the least you can do is be a man, pay her yourself,

598
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,850
或者认怂  告诉她你付不起
or suck it up and tell her the truth.

599
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,050
够了  不要这样
All right. That's enough. We're not doing this.

600
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,610
-我是冠名合伙人  -路易
- I am a name partner. - Louis.

601
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,960
不  他没有权利
No. He has no right to--

602
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,180
你再不闭嘴我就动手让你闭嘴
I will slap the taste out of your mouth.

603
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,150
谢了  杰西卡
Thanks, Jessica.

604
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,860
感谢你站在我这边
I appreciate you being on the same page.

605
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,930
我才没站你那边
Oh, we're not on the same page.

606
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,540
你说什么呀
What are you talking about?

607
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,350
我昨天让你们俩去主持会议
I wanted the two of you to run that meeting yesterday

608
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,010
就是为了看你们能不能合作  但显然不能
to see if you were okay with each other, but you're not.

609
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,430
他也许是小气  但他没错
He may be cheap, but he's right.

610
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,300
你就是在因为唐娜的事拿他出气
You are taking your Donna anger out on him,

611
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,490
你不许再这样
and it needs to stop.

612
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,660
我才没因为唐娜的事生气
I don't have Donna anger.

613
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,400
说的跟真的一样
Oh, like hell you don't.

614
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,240
如果你再自欺欺人
And if you don't admit that to yourself,

615
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,350
我也会对你动手
I'll slap the taste out of your mouth too.

616
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,020
你在忙什么呢  迈克
What you working on there, Mike?

617
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,310
没什么  善后工作
Um, nothing. Just some cleanup.

618
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,090
有事吗  杰西卡
What can I do for you, Jessica?

619
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,060
我需要你告诉我你为什么
You can tell me why you reopened a case

620
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,530
重开了一个我们之前就没打算接的
against a major insurance company

621
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,660
起诉大型保险公司的案子
we were never a part of to start with.

622
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,370
我重开
Um, I reopened it

623
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,640
是因为我看了一眼觉得能赢
because I looked at it and it's a winner.

624
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,850
我也看了一眼
Well, I also looked at it,

625
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,230
我觉得赢不了
and I say it's a loser.

626
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,460
-杰西卡  -你接了个意外事故的案子
- Jessica, look-- - You took a case on contingency

627
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,070
原告还都是穷人
where every plaintiff is dirt poor,

628
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,490
也就是说就算赢了
which means, even if we win,

629
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,610
也是入不敷出
compensation for lost wages is nothing.

630
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,950
你没算惩罚性赔偿
You're leaving out punitive damages,

631
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,230
而且哈维天天都接意外事故的案子
and Harvey takes cases on contingency all the time.

632
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,750
他接那些是为了赚钱
Yeah, he takes them to make money,

633
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,100
不是为了救困在树上的小猫咪
not to save kittens in trees.

634
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,230
我也告诉你了这件能赚钱
And I just told you this is going to make money.

635
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,100
自由铁路公司的案子你也是这么说的
And that's what you said about Liberty Rail,

636
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,260
可你不但没赚钱
and instead of making money,

637
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,230
还差点害唐娜进了监狱
it almost ended with Donna behind bars.

638
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,080
这次不会有人入狱的
No one is going to jail for this.

639
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,860
没错  因为那需要很多资金支持
No, they're not, because it's going to cost a fortune to fund,

640
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,370
而我不打算把钱花在不大可能成功的事上
and I'm not laying out that kind of money on a long shot.

641
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,020
杰西卡  我向我自己保证了
Jessica, look. I promised myself that I--

642
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,870
我不管你向谁保证了
I don't care who you promised.

643
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,130
你没经过我的允许就接了这个案子
You took this case without running it by me,

644
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,270
而且你不问我就是因为知道我不会同意
and you did it because you knew I'd say no.

645
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,830
-杰西卡  -够了
- Jessica-- - So that's enough.

646
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,390
撤销  否则我去撤销
Dump it, or I will.

647
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,760
我得和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

648
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,730
是吗
Really?

649
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,080
上次你和我谈
'Cause the last time you talked to me,

650
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,310
你让我开口  然后又否决我
you told me to open my mouth, and you slammed it shut.

651
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,930
因为你想整哈维  但我现在愿意了
Because you wanted to go after Harvey, but now I'm on board.

652
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,580
-我凭什么相信你  -回答我
- Why should I believe you? - Answer me this.

653
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,130
如果我们投票的话
How many partners do you have in your pocket,

654
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,460
你能调动多少合伙人支持
if we put your proposal to a vote?

655
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,030
45%
I can get 45%.

656
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,080
你该相信我的理由就是
Well, then the reason you can believe me

657
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,710
我能帮你通过投票
is that I'm gonna get you the difference.

658
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,670
你自己的会议上你都不敢支持我
How you gonna do that if you don't have the courage

659
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,190
你又要怎么办到这事
to back my plan at your own meeting?

660
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,340
我会让律所的人都知道
By showing everyone at this firm exactly

661
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,800
哈维赚了多少
what Harvey makes.

662
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,620
这下我是确定你在骗我了
Now I know you're bullshitting me.

663
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,940
那样做你会被开除
You'd be fired if you did that.

664
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,580
如果是意外泄露就没问题
Not if I do it by accident.

665
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,840
你能相信吗  卖运动鞋
Can you believe that sneaker brings in

666
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,050
仅在中国就能赚到十亿
over a billion dollars from China alone?

667
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,970
这么高的收益让我不禁思考
With earnings like that, makes me wonder

668
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,090
你为什么还要坑我的委托人
why you're trying to rip off my client.

669
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,050
以合理的价格收购公司
Buying a man's company for a fair price

670
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,230
可不能算坑吧
is hardly ripping him off.

671
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,990
问题就是价格不合理
But it's not a fair price.

672
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,100
你给了我的委托人两天时间考虑
You gave my client 48 hours to take your offer.

673
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,180
我给你五分钟考虑我的提议
I'm gonna give you five minutes to take mine.

674
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,210
出双倍  否则我就走了
Double your money, or I walk out the door.

675
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,070
真是可笑
That's ridiculous.

676
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,780
可笑的是你去欺负一个
What's ridiculous is you preying on a man

677
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,680
刚刚失去了挚友的人
who just lost his lifelong friend.

678
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,820
我是商人  不是悲痛顾问
I'm a businessman, not a grief counselor.

679
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,380
那我就给你当回顾问
Then let me counsel you on this.

680
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,240
因为他正处于悲痛中  所以我有权
Because he's grieving, I have the ability

681
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,870
向董事会申请延后这个交易
to go to the board and delay this sale.

682
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,570
但你不会  因为你知道
But you're not going to, because you know

683
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,140
那样等他终于愿意卖了
it'll drive down the price even more

684
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,250
价格会更低
when he eventually wants to sell anyway.

685
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,570
没错  是会如此
You're right, it will,

686
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,510
但我告诉你  波克先生
but I'll tell you what, Mr. Polk,

687
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,730
就算那样也比你现在的出价高
it'll still be worth more than your offer.

688
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,230
而且等我的委托人从悲痛中走出来
And after my client's grief passes,

689
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,900
也许他还会想卖
he may still want to sell,

690
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,270
但绝对不会卖给你了
but it sure as hell won't be to you.

691
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,690
再联系
I got to call you back.

692
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,590
你怎么进来的啊
How the hell did you get in here?

693
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,240
开除你之后我立刻把艾米开除了的
I fired your assistant ten minutes after I fired you.

694
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,100
看来就算那样艾米也有办法放人进来
Guess Amy still knows how to get a person through.

695
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,340
恭喜
Congratulations.

696
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,010
你怎么进来就怎么出去吧
You made your way in. You can make your way out.

697
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,650
但首先我想给你个机会赚两千万
Not before I give you the chance to make $20 million.

698
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,100
你为什么觉得我会想卷入
What makes you think I want to get in the business

699
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,710
保险集体诉讼呢
of underwriting class-action lawsuits?

700
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,620
因为你想赚钱
Because you're in the business of making money,

701
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,220
在你拒绝以前我先说
and before you say no,

702
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,950
我可以给你20%的提成
I'm gonna give you 20% off the top.

703
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,160
这是上限了
It's the best deal out there.

704
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,720
不够
Well, that's not good enough.

705
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,110
25%
25%.

706
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,840
你有权做这个决定吗
Are you authorized to do that?

707
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,160
你没有
No, you're not.

708
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,140
以我对你的了解  他们可能都没批准你
Knowing you, you probably don't even have the authorization

709
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,200
直接来找我
to come to me in the first place.

710
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,570
我来找你是因为这能补偿我犯下的错误
I came to you because this is our chance to make it right.

711
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,670
一派胡言  你需要的是钱
Bullshit. You need money.

712
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,600
你站在我面前就为了这一个目的
That's the only reason you're standing here in front of me.

713
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,440
乔纳森  我可以找任何人
Jonathan, I could have gone anywhere.

714
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,710
我来找你与去找沃尔特・吉利斯是一个道理
I came to you for the same reason I went to Walter Gillis,

715
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,600
为了弥补错误
to make it right.

716
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,200
不信你打电话问他
Pick up the phone and ask him.

717
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,320
我不是沃尔特・吉利斯
I'm not Walter Gillis.

718
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:13,960
告诉艾米我谢谢她让你过了安保
Tell Amy I said "Thank you" for getting you past security,

719
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,640
因为我现在要联系所有投资银行家
'cause now I'm gonna call every investment banker I know

720
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,610
让他们别搭理你的提议
and tell them to pass on your offer

721
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,000
因为迈克・罗斯不值得信任
because Mike Ross can't be trusted.

722
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,560
这是什么
What the hell is this?

723
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,690
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

724
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,320
你知道  这是哈维最近三个案子的收益表
Yes, you do. This is Harvey's last three income statements,

725
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,940
我发现它们被放在复印机里
and I found them sitting in the copy machine.

726
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,600
唐娜  你得把它放回去
Donna, I need you to put that back where you found it,

727
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,990
你得马上放回去
and I need you to put it back now.

728
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,530
-我不  -这不是请求
- I won't do it. - That was not a request.

729
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,540
-这是命令  -我不管
- That was an order. - I don't care.

730
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,270
-我不会让你这么做的  -你看吧
- I'm not gonna let you do this. - See?

731
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,340
我就知道一有机会你就会
I knew that you would jump at the first opportunity

732
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,780
站在他那边对付我
you had to take his side over mine.

733
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,750
这不是我选择哈维
This isn't me taking Harvey's side.

734
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,670
而是我在阻止你犯大错
This is me stopping you from making a huge mistake.

735
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,920
要是他这么干  你肯定不会阻止他
And if he did the same thing, you wouldn't be stopping him.

736
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,820
哈维从不做这种事
Harvey would never do anything like this,

737
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,630
就算他做了  我也会阻止他
and if he did, I sure as hell would.

738
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,920
-胡说  -不  路易
- Oh, bullshit. - No, Louis.

739
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,400
我没胡说
It's not bullshit.

740
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,440
你根本不知道有多少次
You have no idea how many times

741
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,350
我让他别对你走极端
I kept him from going overboard with you.

742
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,180
-我一半工作都是在做这个  -你知道吗
- It was half my goddamn job. - Well, you know what?

743
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,470
你也没能每次都阻止他
You didn't stop him every time,

744
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,040
这次你也别想阻止我
and you're not stopping me this time.

745
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,400
把它给我
Now, give me that thing.

746
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,510
好吧  你不想放回去
Okay. Fine. You don't want to put it back?

747
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,710
-我自己去  -路易
- I'll do it myself. - Louis--

748
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,040
够了  唐娜  你知道吗
No. Donna, you know what?

749
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,470
是你主动为我工作的
You came to work for me.

750
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,840
你做决定的时候知道我是什么样的人
You knew who I was when you did,

751
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,270
你该作出决定了
so now it's time for you to decide.

752
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,580
你到底要不要站在我这边
Are you with me or not?

753
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,430
{\an8}路易・利特
高级合伙人

754
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,710
虽然我不反对意料之外的惊喜礼物
While I'm not opposed to unexpected gifts on my desk,

755
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,250
但我更希望它们是巧克力做的
I do prefer if they're made of chocolate.

756
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:55,940
懂了
Got it.

757
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,440
下次我送你签好的婚前协议时
Next time I leave you a signed prenup,

758
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,850
肯定做成巧克力
it will be made of chocolate.

759
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,290
你为什么要签
Why did you sign it?

760
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,800
-我去见了你爸爸  -什么
- I went to see your dad. - You did what?

761
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
我想让他知道
I wanted to show him

762
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,820
他女儿要嫁的是个什么样的男人
what kind of man his daughter was marrying,

763
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,580
因为我希望他信任我
because I wanted him to trust me.

764
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,940
迈克  他不信任任何人  正因如此
Mike, he doesn't trust anybody, which is exactly why

765
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,870
所以我才对他的婚姻建议不感兴趣
I'm not interested in his marital advice.

766
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,850
但就像你说的
But like you said, I would appreciate it

767
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,330
将来你做这种事之前
if in the future,

768
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,950
跟我说一声  我会很感激的
you tell me if you're gonna do something like that.

769
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,600
你没错  我去之前应该告诉你
You're right, I should have told you before I went over there,

770
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,570
但我得说  虽然没让他信任我
but for the record, instead of getting him to trust me,

771
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,720
但我相信了他
I ended up trusting him.

772
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,270
-迈克  -瑞秋  听我说
- Mike-- - Rachel, listen to me.

773
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,050
我知道你认为他这么做是为了控制你
I know you think that he's doing this to control you,

774
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:40,780
但他觉得是在保护你
but he thinks he's doing it to protect you.

775
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,880
而我从没有过一个
And the truth is that I never had a father

776
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,140
为我做这种事的父亲  所以...
who could do something like that for me, so...

777
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,040
你应该试着去了解他的初衷
I think that you should try and see where he's coming from.

778
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,570
那是什么
What's that?

779
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,810
你的新价格
It's your new offer.

780
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,860
-价钱翻了一倍  -这是我的工作
- It's twice the money. - It's what I do.

781
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,490
所以我才付你这么多钱
And that's why I pay you so much.

782
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,090
我不是为了钱才这么做的  泰迪
I didn't do it for the money, Teddy.

783
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,790
我这么做是因为你被敲了竹杠
I did it because you were getting ripped off,

784
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,170
我不能坐视不理
and I'm not gonna let that happen to you,

785
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,300
无论情况如何
no matter what the circumstances.

786
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,310
你知道了
You found out.

787
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,100
你怎么不告诉我实情
Why didn't you tell me what happened?

788
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,740
因为我不希望你来阻止我
Because I didn't want you to try and stop me.

789
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,220
你还是可以来找我啊
You still could have come to me.

790
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,420
跟你说什么
And tell you what?

791
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,980
我七岁就认识的朋友
That my best friend from when we were seven died

792
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,230
突然死了吗
out of the blue?

793
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,490
我二十年没和他说过话了
I hadn't spoken to him in 20 years,

794
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,520
因为我们为了一个
because we got into a fight

795
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,900
我连名字都忘了的女人吵了一架
over some woman whose name I can't even remember.

796
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,060
我现在根本不在乎运动鞋生意
And now I don't give a shit about the sneaker business.

797
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,820
我会理解的
Well, I would have understood.

798
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,330
你会吗
Would you have?

799
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,230
哈维
Look, Harvey,

800
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,720
我很感激你为我做的事
I appreciate what you did for me.

801
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,420
如果我能重回商场  你永远是我的律师
If I'm ever back in business, you'll always be my lawyer.

802
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,880
我永远是你的朋友
I'll always be your friend.

803
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,610
-路易  你有空吗  -不知道
- Louis, do you have a second? - Oh, I don't know.

804
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,880
你现在又要喊我什么动物  鬣鳞蜥吗
What animal are you gonna call me now? An iguana?

805
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,150
我不会叫你绰号的
I'm not gonna call you anything.

806
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,290
我来是想冰释前嫌
I'm here because I want to put everything behind us.

807
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,000
我真幸运啊
Well, aren't I lucky?

808
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,350
路易  别这样
Louis, please.

809
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,850
你没错
You were right.

810
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,780
会议上我很混蛋  在厕所里也是
I was a dick in that meeting and again in the bathroom

811
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,570
在杰西卡那的时候也是
and again with Jessica.

812
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,260
我说了一些希望能收回的话
I said some things that I wish I could take back,

813
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,460
但我们已经做了很久的朋友了
but we've been friends with each other for a long time,

814
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,450
我不希望就这么断交
and I don't want to throw that away.

815
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,260
你是真心的吗
You really mean that?

816
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,560
是的
I do.

817
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,920
过来
Come here.

818
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,860
哈维  这感觉太好了
Harvey, this is amazing.

819
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,300
我从没想过你会来找我
I never thought you would come to me and--

820
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,540
-见鬼  -什么见鬼
- Oh, shit. - "Oh, shit" What?

821
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,190
我忘了件事  我得去易趣网竞价个东西
I forgot. I have to put a bid on an item on eBay.

822
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,050
-什么  -一个蒙古的
- What? - A Mongolian...

823
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,860
螳螂的钢琴伴奏芭蕾
praying mantis piano ballet.

824
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,130
和你聊得真开心  我得走了
Good talk. I have to go.

825
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,100
这是什么  这不是你该看的
What is that? You shouldn't be reading that.

826
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,330
这可是保密信息
That's privileged information.

827
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,520
你他妈从哪里搞来的
Where the hell did you--

828
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,720
见鬼
Oh, shit.

829
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,630
这是干嘛的
What's that for?

830
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,280
这是预付费用
It's a retainer.

831
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,000
我在寻求一些法律建议
I am looking for some legal advice.

832
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,160
我觉得你雇不起我
I don't think you can afford me.

833
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,970
不会花太久的  我只是想让你看看这个
It won't take long. I just want you to take a look at this.

834
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,020
你让迈克签了这个
You got Mike to sign this?

835
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,410
我爸干的
My dad did.

836
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,070
那你来找我干嘛
Then why are you coming to me?

837
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,340
因为你曾经说过你有个跟我一样的
Because you once told me that you have a father

838
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,710
父亲
just like mine.

839
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,680
我猜  你觉得罗伯特是在试着控制你
Let me guess, you think Robert is trying to control you?

840
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,430
他的确成功地使
He did manage to construct a situation

841
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,900
我生命中的两个最重要的男人
where the two most important men in my life

842
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,560
背着我做下关于我的决定
are making decisions about me without me.

843
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,020
你知道我是怎么想的吗
You know what I think?

844
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,390
我觉得这跟你父亲没关系
I think this has nothing to do with your dad,

845
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,020
而且你清楚这点
and you know it.

846
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,810
是迈克
Mike.

847
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,540
对  是迈克
Yes. Mike.

848
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,100
这才是你来找我的真正原因
That's the real reason why you're coming to me,

849
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,540
哪怕你告诉自己它不是
even though you told yourself it wasn't.

850
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,190
-这可以保护我  -是的
- It could protect me. - It could.

851
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,200
但也可以有别的作用
It could also do something else.

852
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,520
比如在无形中破坏我们的感情
Undermine my relationship.

853
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,770
相信我
Believe me.

854
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,760
我已经有过最深的感受
I learned that one the hard way,

855
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,360
这意味着你必须扪心自问
which means you need to ask yourself,

856
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,180
你究竟爱迈克有多深
how much do you really love Mike?

857
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,150
全心全意地爱  深爱
I love him all the way.

858
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,310
那就别签
Then don't sign it.

859
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,900
免费
On the house.

860
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,670
还有  瑞秋  就你父亲这个人来看
And, Rachel, as far as your father goes,

861
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,230
我和他并不是很对盘
he and I don't always see eye to eye,

862
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,030
但我确实尊敬他
but I do respect that man.

863
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,350
要说他跟我爸有像的地方  那就是
And if he is anything like my father,

864
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,940
尽管他有很多缺点
for all of his faults,

865
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,080
但他情愿死
he would take a bullet

866
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,350
也不会让他的宝贝女儿伤到一丝一毫
before he'd let anything happen to his little girl.

867
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,950
多谢了
Thank you.

868
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,130
来了
Uh, okay.

869
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,800
上次是我和哈罗德买单
Harold and I ponied up last time

870
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,510
因为情况比较特殊
because it was a special occasion,

871
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,260
但朋友  今晚你请
but tonight drinks are on you, my friend.

872
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,390
可以接受
That's fair.

873
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,530
虽然我很喜欢这份礼物  但吉米  还给你
As much as I appreciate it, Jimmy, I got to return the gift.

874
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,770
-什么  -是的
- What? - Yeah.

875
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,940
-我不能接这个案子  -不不不
- I can't take the case. - No, no, no.

876
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,380
什么叫你不能接这个案子
What do you mean you can't take the case?

877
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,340
杰西卡不会为工时花钱
Jessica won't lay out the money for the man hours.

878
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,350
那就让其他人出这笔钱好了
Okay, then get somebody else to lay out the money.

879
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,540
迈克  投资银行现在都在
Mike, investment banks are taking stakes

880
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,660
参与这些事情
in shit like this now.

881
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,620
所有人里  你该最清楚
You, of all people, should know that.

882
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,970
你觉得我没试过吗
You think I didn't try that?

883
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,220
我没有成功
It didn't work.

884
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,070
妈的  迈克
God damn it, Mike.

885
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,470
你总是说你是在乎那些人的
You always said you gave a shit about people.

886
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,910
你也说了我可以退回这个案子
And you said that I could return this case.

887
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,650
我不管我说过什么
I don't care what I said.

888
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,700
吉米
Jimmy,

889
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,800
到底发生什么事了
what the hell is going on here?

890
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,890
好吧  我叔叔基思也是受害者之一
Okay. One of the victims was my uncle Keith,

891
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,040
但我没告诉你是因为我表妹来找我
but I didn't tell you about him because my cousin came to me

892
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,600
让我好好处理
and asked me to make it right,

893
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,120
我也答应了她
and I promised her that I would.

894
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,890
但是  我在我们律所没什么发言权
It's just I don't have the juice at my firm,

895
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,040
我也
and I was--

896
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,890
我也很惭愧不敢告诉你
I was too ashamed to tell you.

897
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,070
-吉米  -迈克  听我说
- Jimmy-- - No, Mike, listen.

898
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,770
很抱歉我没跟你直说
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you straight up.

899
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,190
但是  求你了  这些人需要你的帮助
But, please, these people need your help.

900
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,210
杰克  我有什么可以帮到你的吗
What can I do for you, Jack?

901
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,930
你可以跟我解释下
You can explain to me

902
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,450
你怎么会挣到这么多钱的
how the hell you justify making this much money.

903
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,210
你是从哪儿拿到的
Where'd you get this?

904
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,010
它留在复印机里了
Was left in the copy machine.

905
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,620
-谁留下的  -我不知道
- By who? - I don't know.

906
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,020
但现在我知道你为什么
But now I do know why you pissed

907
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,640
对我开会时候提出的想法那么生气了
all over my idea at the meeting.

908
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,010
这可是保密文件
This is confidential.

909
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,600
曾经是
It was confidential.

910
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,330
现在  每个高级合伙人都看过了
Now, every senior partner's seen it,

911
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,270
而且大家都已经火冒三丈了
and people are furious.

912
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,870
我挣的每一分钱都是我应得的
I earn every penny I make.

913
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,310
那可不一定
We'll see about that.

914
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,320
你这话什么意思
What are you talking about?

915
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,750
我刚刚要求明天就我的提议进行投票
I just called for a vote tomorrow on my proposal,

916
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,010
希望你有存钱的习惯
and I hope you've been saving your money,

917
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,830
因为你那钱多事少的工作马上就要没了
because your gravy train's about to leave the station.

918
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,230
所以这就是你说"见鬼"的原因
So this is why you said, "Oh, shit."

919
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,570
不知道你在说什么
What's that?

920
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,900
你当然知道
Oh, you know what it is,

921
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,280
因为是你把它忘在
because you're the one who left it

922
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,880
复印机里的
in the goddamn copier.

923
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,250
天呐  哈维  我是在复印
Oh, my God, Harvey, I was making copies

924
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,110
每个人的工资单留档  我必须
of everyone's salaries for my records, and I must have--

925
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,320
放屁  路易
Bullshit, Louis.

926
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,040
你是为了打击我
You did this to come after me,

927
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,180
然后我道歉之后你想要阻止它
and after I apologized, you ran and tried to stop it.

928
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,020
哈维  求你了  事已至此
Harvey, please, what's done is done,

929
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,640
你也说了  我们是朋友
and like you said before, we're friends.

930
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,060
我们可以渡过这关的  我们也可以搞定投票
We can move past this, and we can fight the vote together.

931
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,450
大家看过之后  我不可能赢得投票的
There's no way I win the vote after people see this.

932
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,990
你想渡过这关是吗  那就去承认是你干的
You want to get past it? Admit what you did.

933
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,360
那我会被自动解约的
That's automatic termination.

934
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,730
然后我们再一起并肩作战
Then we'll fight that together.

935
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,730
-哈维  不行啊  -路易
- Harvey, I can't. - Louis!

936
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,170
杰西卡已经解雇过我一次了
Jessica tried to fire me once.

937
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,990
我不能让她有第二次机会再解雇我
I can't give her the chance to do that again.

938
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,940
你猜怎么着
Well, you know what?

939
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,480
你还会被解雇
It's gonna happen again,

940
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,170
因为我知道你做了什么
because I know what you did.

941
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,720
够了
You know what? That's enough.

942
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,500
你跑来对我咆哮指控
And you come at me flinging accusations,

943
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,600
那你最好有证据
well, you better have proof.

944
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,800
你有证据吗  哈维
You have proof, Harvey?

945
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,540
我看没有
Yeah, I didn't think so.

946
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,060
哈维  你不能再这么不分时间地
Harvey, you don't get to come to me

947
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,980
跑来找我了
at all hours of the night anymore.

948
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,610
我来是因为你的新老板
I'm here because your new boss--

949
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,510
-我知道你为什么来  -那你就知道他做了什么
- I know why you're here. - Then you know what he did.

950
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,570
我需要你承认
And I need you to admit it,

951
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,350
这样我就能阻止他们愚蠢的投票
so I can block their bullshit vote.

952
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,660
然后让路易被开掉吗
And get Louis fired?

953
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,190
如果你一开始就阻止他
He wouldn't be in this mess if you'd have just stopped him

954
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,430
他也不会陷入这种情况
from doing this in the first place.

955
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,180
哈维  如果我知道路易要做这样的事
Harvey, if I knew Louis was gonna do something like this,

956
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,500
我这么说意思不是我真知道
and I'm not saying I did,

957
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,650
我会当面让他不要做
then I would have told him to his face not to.

958
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,030
但如果他坚持要做
But if he went ahead and did it anyway,

959
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,750
我也不会背叛他来纠正这事
then I'm not gonna go behind his back to fix it.

960
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,980
因为你总说  "人一旦选择了立场
Because you always said, "Once you pick a side,

961
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,500
"就要忠于他的立场
"if you're not loyal to that side,

962
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,660
"不然他算什么人呢"
"then who the hell are you?"

963
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,620
那你在选择一个
Then you should have thought of that

964
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,360
会做出这种事的人之前
before you picked someone who would do something like this

965
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,530
就该好好想想
in the first place.

966
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,810
你想知道路易是什么样的人吗
You want to know what kind of man Louis is?

967
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,470
整件事情的起因就是他想证明
This whole thing started because he wanted to prove

968
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,690
他会给你支持
to you that he had your back,

969
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,600
因为他觉得你嫉妒我们
because he thought you were jealous of us.

970
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,180
不  整件事的起因是
No, this whole thing started

971
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,230
因为我告诉他从我们加入律所开始
because I told him that I've been paying your salary

972
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,040
就是我在付你薪水
since we came to the firm,

973
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,140
而他太小气  自己付不出
and he was too cheap to pay it himself

974
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,200
还软弱得不敢跟你说实话
and too weak to tell you the truth.

975
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,700
如果你把这件事瞒了12年
And if you've kept that from me for 12 years

976
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,300
而现在又说出来  那你可能真是在嫉妒
and you're only just telling me now, then maybe you are jealous.

977
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,670
迈克  你怎么进来的  她已经给你钥匙了吗
Mike, how'd you get in? Give you a key already?

978
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,430
没有  劳拉让我进来的  说你在这里
No. Laura let me in. She said you'd be back here.

979
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,470
我不知道为什么
I don't know why.

980
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,540
我想找点有味的东西吃
I'm trying to find something tasty.

981
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,980
结果这整间屋子里
There's not one damn thing that's bad for you

982
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,130
就没有一点不健康食品
in this entire house.

983
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,160
那我猜我没跟她说我给你带了这个
Then I guess it's a good thing I didn't tell her

984
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,680
是正确的
that I brought you these.

985
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,310
鸡块
Oh, chicken nuggets.

986
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,830
瑞秋自己做的
Rachel made them herself.

987
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,650
油炸的  不是烤的吧
Deep-fried, not baked?

988
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,370
请随意享用
You're welcome.

989
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,850
她签了婚前协议吗
She sign that prenup?

990
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:06,550
没有  但她送来这些是因为她想通了
No, but she sent those because she realized the prenup

991
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,470
婚前协议代表的是爱  不是控制
was about love, not control.

992
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,560
那我尊重她的选择
Then I respect her decision.

993
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,520
什么改变了她对我的想法
What changed her mind about me?

994
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,810
你想知道原因吗
You really want to know?

995
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,220
-想啊  -是杰西卡
- Mm-hmm. - Jessica.

996
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,800
不是吧  她说了什么
Oh, shit. What did she say?

997
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,340
我得知道那个秘密
I got to know that secret.

998
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,790
我不知道她跟瑞秋说了什么
I don't know what she said to Rachel,

999
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,860
但我知道她跟我说了什么
but I know what she said to me.

1000
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,460
这才是你来这里的原因
So that's why you're here.

1001
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,180
记得我跟你说过我要代理的那些人吗
You know those people that I told you I was fighting for?

1002
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,930
杰西卡不愿意接这个案子
Jessica's not gonna go for it.

1003
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,650
我明白
I get it.

1004
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,470
要花太多钱  而回报又太少
Too much money to lay out for too little payoff.

1005
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:42,180
但你说过你也曾是那些人中的一员
But you said you came from the same place as these people.

1006
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,410
罗伯特  他们需要你这样的人为他们争取
Robert, they need someone like you to fight for them,

1007
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,320
而我做不到
and I can't do it.

1008
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,680
所以我请求你帮忙
So I'm asking you to.

1009
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,430
你觉得这案子能赢吗
You think this case is a winner?

1010
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,610
能赢
I do.

1011
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,230
那你觉得我们一起做如何
Then what do you say we do it together?

1012
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,050
你在这里做什么  路易
What are you doing here, Louis?

1013
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,780
我发现你今早没来投票
I notice you didn't come to the vote this morning.

1014
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,580
是没有  我在忙着跟客户联系
No, I didn't. I was busy closing a deal for my client.

1015
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,710
我猜猜  你让他们回填销售日期到昨天了
Let me guess. You had 'em backdate your sale to yesterday,

1016
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,210
这样钱就能按过去的薪资结构结算
so it falls under your old pay structure?

1017
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,000
不  路易  那是你会做的事
No, Louis, that's something you would do,

1018
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,790
因为我跟你不一样  我不在乎钱
because unlike you, I don't actually care about the money.

1019
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,710
你要我相信那鬼话吗
You expect me to believe that?

1020
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,400
我不管你信不信
I don't care whether you believe it or not.

1021
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,970
我的薪酬包能说明我做了什么
My compensation package was about recognizing what I do.

1022
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,190
钱只是结果
Money was just a consequence.

1023
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,050
所以我才不介意跟唐娜分享
That's why I didn't mind sharing it with Donna.

1024
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,540
-你出去吧  -不
- Now, get out. - No.

1025
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,590
你必然在乎钱  因为那是唯一
You did care about the money, because it was the last thing

1026
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,280
可以区别你我的东西了
you had that separated you from me.

1027
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,540
-你说什么  -我成了冠名合伙人
- Excuse me? - I got name partner.

1028
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,150
我得到了唐娜  这让你抓狂
I got Donna, and that drove you nuts.

1029
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,090
所以你在会上打击我
So you shit on me at the meeting,

1030
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,210
然后又假装道歉
and then you pretended to apologize.

1031
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,700
我确实道歉了  路易
I did apologize, Louis.

1032
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,420
我很爷们地去找你
I came to you like a man,

1033
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,180
而之后我给你机会报答我的时候
and then when I gave you the chance to make it up to me,

1034
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,390
你卡壳了  一如既往
you choked, like you always do.

1035
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,700
那你现在怎么看我
Well, how you like me now?

1036
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,990
因为你唯一保有的  就是你赚得比我多
Because the only thing you had left was that you made more.

1037
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,710
现在你也不比我多了  我赢了
And now you don't, and I win.

1038
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,430
你什么也没赢
You didn't win anything.

1039
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,160
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1040
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,720
我在说  无论你得到什么
I'm talking about the fact that no matter what you get,

1041
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,160
你总是想要更多
you're always wanting more.

1042
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,540
但总想要更多的问题在于
And the problem with always wanting more is

1043
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,280
从你得到的那刻开始  它就是可以被夺走的
that the second you get it, it can always be taken away.

1044
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,440
你无法逆转投票结果的
You're not reversing that vote.

1045
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,830
我不是在说投票
I'm not talking about the vote.

1046
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,590
我在说你最在乎的东西
I'm talking about what you value most.

1047
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,460
没错
That's right.

1048
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,730
也许今天明天不会发生
Might not happen today or tomorrow,

1049
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,530
但它总会发生的  因为我会想办法
but it's gonna happen, because I'm gonna make it happen.

1050
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,870
某天  你会走进办公室
One day, you're gonna walk into your office,

1051
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,990
发现她不见了
and she's gonna be gone.
