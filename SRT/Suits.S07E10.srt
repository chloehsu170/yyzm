00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,300
《诉讼双雄》

17
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,750
我想和你合作这个无偿案  掠夺性贷款
I want to work with you on the pro bono, predatory lending,

18
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,490
占有色人种的便宜
taking advantage of people of color.

19
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,650
我们有123个起诉人
We have 123 plaintiffs

20
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,930
被操控负担更高的贷款汇率
who were all steered into higher-rate mortgages.

21
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,460
他用你这样的傻瓜打掩护
And he's using fools like you to cover his own ass.

22
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,630
我绝不会在一个  有歧视的地方工作
I would never work for a place that engaged in discrimination,

23
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,520
而且我很乐意在法庭上这么说
and I more than happy to say that on the stand.

24
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,460
这个案子无关乎种族或钱
This case isn't about race or money.

25
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,850
掌管这家公司的人是个彻彻底底的掠夺者
The man who heads up this company is a predator,

26
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,940
25年前你姨妈为他工作过
and your aunt worked for him 25 years ago,

27
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,390
他把她的生活变成了地狱
made her life a living hell.

28
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,730
-因为她是黑人吗  -因为她是个美人
- Because she was black? - Because she was beautiful.

29
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,640
法官大人  我想提交这个文件
Your Honor, I would like to introduce this document.

30
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,330
除非他有文章提到的真实备忘录
Unless he has the actual memo it refers to,

31
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,030
否则这篇文章不能采纳
this article itself is inadmissible.

32
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,070
我想提交这篇文章的原因
The reason that I would like to have entered that article

33
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,260
是向法庭显示他把它毁了
is to show that he buried the memo.

34
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,510
-说谎  -不是说谎
- That is a lie. - It's not a lie.

35
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,370
我能证明
I can prove it.

36
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,980
他传唤我两日后出庭
He's calling me to the stand in two days.

37
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,020
我们得帮你准备好
Then we need to get you prepared

38
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,690
-还需要有观众  -模拟庭审吗
- in front of an audience. - A mock trial?

39
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,980
我不会让唐娜再遭受这种事
I'm not putting Donna through that.

40
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,180
首席检察官办公室给我发了传票
I've been subpoenaed by the Attorney General's Office.

41
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,180
你又要我进行人身攻击
You are asking me to go personal again.

42
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,850
我不干
And I won't do it.

43
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,130
我是在要你再保护我一次
I am asking you to protect me again.

44
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,270
而且你这么做不是坏事
And I am telling you it's okay to do it.

45
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,670
你后悔把哈维置于这个人之上吗
Do you regret putting Harvey over this guy?

46
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,100
我后悔把哈维置于我之上
I regret putting Harvey over myself.

47
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,390
另一条有什么不好
What was wrong with the other one?

48
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,730
什么
What?

49
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,650
这是你换上的第三条领带了
That's the third tie you've put on.

50
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,910
我就是不喜欢另外两条
Oh, I just didn't like how the other two looked.

51
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,370
哈维  怎么了
Harvey, what's going on?

52
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,070
我从未见过你在庭审前对自己这么不自信
I've never known you to second- guess yourself before trial.

53
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,110
没事  我就是需要一条合适的领带
Nothing's going on. I just needed the right tie.

54
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,780
那会不会和这个人要找
Does that maybe have to do with this man

55
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,090
唐娜的麻烦有关
coming after Donna?

56
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,820
没有  是因为我得
No, just has to do with the fact

57
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,690
靠路易来准备我自己的案子
that I have to rely on Louis to prepare my own case.

58
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,740
你担心她也是正常的
It's okay that you're worried about her.

59
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,890
你生命中还有其他你在乎的女人
I don't feel threatened by you having another woman

60
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,740
不让我觉得受威胁
in your life that you care about.

61
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,210
事实上  你的忠诚是我一直
In fact, your loyalty is one of the things

62
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,070
欣赏你的地方之一
I've always admired about you.

63
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,150
-是吗  -当然
- It is? - Yeah, of course.

64
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,920
你关心的每一个人
You've felt betrayed at one time or another

65
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,060
都曾让你感到过遭受背叛
by almost every person you've ever cared about,

66
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,650
尽管如此
and in spite of that,

67
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,670
你还是在他们遭受威胁时保护他们
you protect them whenever they're threatened.

68
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,690
当然了  谁都会那么做
Of course I do. Anybody would.

69
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,200
不  不是谁都会  但你会
No, not anybody would, but you do,

70
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,960
所以唐娜和你生命中所有的其他人
and that's why Donna and all the other people in your life

71
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,150
能有你都是幸运的
are lucky to have you.

72
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,380
谢谢  宝拉
Thanks, Paula.

73
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,030
今天好运
Good luck today.

74
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,280
亚历克斯  不管你要去哪  调头
Alex, wherever you're going, turn around.

75
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,400
马利克传唤了唐娜  所有人都要帮忙
Malik subpoenaed Donna, so it's all hands on deck.

76
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,290
我是想帮忙  哈维
And I'd love to help, Harvey,

77
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,650
但我另有事要处理
but I need to get to another deck.

78
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,260
-怎么了  -布莱顿・古尔德
- What happened? - Bratton Gould happened.

79
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,340
我们不都解决掉他们了吗
I thought we took care of them.

80
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,300
我们是解决了布莱顿
We took care of Bratton,

81
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,730
现在另一个要来报仇了
and now the other one wants revenge.

82
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,220
-怎么说  -你觉得呢
- How? - How do you think?

83
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,240
-该死  辉瑞制药  -没错
- Shit, Pfizer. - Yup, Pfizer.

84
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,560
-需要帮忙吗  -哈维  如果我需要帮忙
- You need help? - Harvey, if I needed help,

85
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,790
我当初就拿不到辉瑞制药
I wouldn't have landed Pfizer in the first place.

86
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,520
亚历克斯
Alex.

87
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,040
拿下他们
Go get 'em.

88
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,890
{\an8}二十五年前

89
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,230
我们已经读了42遍了
Well, that was the 42nd time we've read that.

90
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,850
-你改主意了吗  -没有
- Have you changed your mind? - Nope.

91
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,470
那男孩当初就不该叫
That boy was stupid for telling Elizabeth

92
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,410
伊丽莎白去
to go away in the first place.

93
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,980
-你们在看什么  -你觉得呢
- What are you two reading? - What do you think?

94
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,640
《伊丽莎白》
Ah, Elizabeth.

95
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,180
我们就是因为她才给你起了那个中间名
You know, we got the idea for your middle name from her.

96
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
才不是的
That's not true.

97
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,810
你确实很像她
Well, you are just like her

98
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,920
因为她也不许男人告诉她该做什么
because she doesn't let boys tell her what to do either.

99
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,800
而且她也跟她妈妈一样
And she's also just like her mother.

100
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,700
去那边看会儿书吧
Now, go read over there for a minute.

101
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,940
我想跟你姑姑说说话
I want to talk to your aunt.

102
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,970
-那姑娘真不一般  -是吧
- That girl is something else. - Don't I know it?

103
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,630
你单位那人怎么样了
What's going on with the guy at work?

104
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,290
你不用担心那个  罗伯
You don't need to worry about that, Robbie.

105
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,470
我能处理好
I can take care of it.

106
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,400
听我的
I'm telling you,

107
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,290
最好的处理办法
the best way to take care of it

108
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,270
就是悄悄调职
is to quietly get yourself transferred

109
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,950
别惹麻烦
and not make any trouble.

110
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,310
我不是那样的人
Well, that is not who I am,

111
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,630
如果你到现在还不知道...
and if you don't know that by now--

112
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,460
我知道
Yeah, I know, I know.

113
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,780
你  瑞秋  伊丽莎白  劳拉
You, Rachel, Elizabeth, and Laura, hell,

114
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,490
在这里丢只死猫
a man can't swing a dead cat around here

115
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,130
都会砸中个固执的女人
without hitting a strong-willed woman.

116
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,770
-打扰你了吗  -没有
- Am I interrupting? - No.

117
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,060
我就是在想案子
I was just thinking about the case.

118
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,560
我也是  我想我有办法
So was I, and I think I have a way

119
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,970
让案子不被撤销了
to keep it from getting dismissed.

120
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,940
说说吧
All right, let's hear it.

121
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,910
公司说他们有规程
The company says they have protocols in place

122
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,890
来避免歧视  但我们也知道
to prevent discrimination, but we also know

123
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,210
他们有个占女人便宜的执行总裁
that they have a CEO who takes advantage of women.

124
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,360
如果你是在说贾丝敏...
If you're talking about Jasmine--

125
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,000
我是说所有女人
I'm talking about women.

126
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,710
-什么意思  -我的意思是
- What's your point? - My point is, a man

127
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,180
能对贾丝敏姑姑做出那种事的男人
who did what he did to Aunt Jasmine

128
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,180
肯定也这样伤害过别的女人  那么...
has done this to other women, which means--

129
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,370
瑞秋  那不是歧视
Rachel, that's not discrimination.

130
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,020
-那是骚扰  -不  爸爸
- That's harassment. - No, Dad, it's treating

131
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,940
那是区别对待一群人
a group of people differently,

132
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,330
这就是歧视的定义
which is the definition of discrimination.

133
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,010
这容许我们抗辩有规律可循
And it sets the stage for us to argue a pattern.

134
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,870
看来我们得去找个
Then I guess we need to find someone

135
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,350
他也这么对待过的人了
he's done this to before.

136
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,400
就是这样
That's the thing.

137
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,820
我可能已经找到了
I think I already have.

138
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,250
时候到了吗  我五分钟后就到
Is it time? I'll be there in five minutes.

139
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,540
我需要点时间整理自己
I just need a second to gather myself.

140
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,510
随你吧
You can take all the time you need

141
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,760
我们不做模拟庭审了
because we're not doing this trial.

142
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,170
路易  你说什么呢
Louis, what the hell are you talking about?

143
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,760
马利克会在证人席上对我穷追猛打
Malik's gonna come after me on that stand,

144
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,960
你要为我做准备的
and you're supposed to get me ready.

145
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,600
我就是这意思
That's what I'm saying.

146
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,550
你根本不需要去作证
You're not gonna have to get up on that stand at all.

147
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,680
怎么了
What's going on here?

148
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,800
一图书馆的人都在等你们呢
We got a library full of people waiting for you two.

149
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,210
我正要过去
I was just about to come down there,

150
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,180
但路易告诉我
and now Louis is trying to tell me

151
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,950
我不需要我面对马利克了
that I don't have to go up against Malik.

152
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,500
路易  法官发传召令了
Louis, the judge issued a subpoena.

153
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,570
她必须作证
She's got to take the stand.

154
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,400
她不需要  你还不懂吗
No, she doesn't. Don't you see?

155
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,930
你曾在地检官办公室工作  而她是你的秘书
You worked in the DA's office. She was your secretary.

156
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,330
你们都办了克利福德・丹纳的案子
And you both worked on the Clifford Danner case.

157
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,290
我去  这是工作成果
Holy shit, it's work product.

158
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,150
这是受保密保护的  路易  你是个天才
It's covered under privilege. Louis, you're a genius.

159
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,540
我们去让图书馆的人走吧
Let's go clear out that library.

160
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,770
等等
Hold on a second.

161
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,560
进行模拟庭审就是为了让我做准备
The whole point of doing a mock trial is to prepare me.

162
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,040
万一这招不好使
What's the downside of still doing that

163
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,150
那么有备无患有什么坏处呢
in case this doesn't work?

164
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,850
坏处是  我就没有足够的时间
The downside is that I won't have enough time

165
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,610
为上庭准备辩据
to prepare the argument for court.

166
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,280
-我不懂  -哈维  我需要告诉你
- I don't see how that-- - Harvey, do I need to tell you

167
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,470
等我做完之后  要上庭用的人也不是你吗
that when I'm finished, you can't be the one to make it?

168
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,860
-不需要  -什么意思
- No, you don't. - Why not?

169
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,930
马利克是想拿这个案子针对我
Because Malik's trying to make this case about me,

170
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,050
所以要尽量让迈克开口
which means the more we can have Mike talk, the better.

171
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,540
*看到钱  就愿意留下吃饭*
*See the money, wanna stay for your meal*

172
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,800
*给你太太再拿块馅饼*
*Get another piece of pie for your wife*

173
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,120
*所有人都想知道那感觉*
*Everybody wanna know how it feel*

174
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,420
*所有人都想见见那景象*
*Everybody wanna see what it's like*

175
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,550
*豆子馅饼我也愿吃  我不在乎*
*I'll even eat a bean pie, I don't mind*

176
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,390
*我和妹子忙着赚钱*
*Me and Missy is so busy, busy making money*

177
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,510
*好了*
*All right*

178
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,670
*退开点  我要跳舞*
*All step back, I'm 'bout to dance*

179
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,100
{\an8}诉讼双雄
第七季 第十集

180
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,380
*美钞爵士摇摇摇*
*The greenback boogie*

181
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,330
怎么回事  他们人呢
Hey, what's going on? Where are they?

182
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,100
无所谓  模拟庭审取消了
It doesn't matter. The mock trial's off.

183
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,400
-取消是什么意思  -路易提出
- What do you mean it's off? - Louis came up

184
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,170
一个工作成果豁免论点
with a work product exemption argument.

185
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,840
唐娜压根不用出庭出证
Donna doesn't have to testify at all.

186
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,270
法官已经准许了吗
You got the judge to agree to that already?

187
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,740
他没批准  路易在想办法
He didn't agree. Louis is gonna work on it,

188
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,820
到时候你来做辩护
and you're gonna argue it,

189
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,520
所以你赶紧去办公室忙起来
so why don't you get down to his office and get busy?

190
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,070
哈维  这个计划很好  但是
Harvey, that's a great plan, but are you sure

191
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,050
你确定我们不做这事不是只是
we're not skipping this just to save Donna

192
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,170
为了不让唐娜在公司出糗吗
embarrassment in front of the firm?

193
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,150
不是  迈克  我们不做这个是要
No, Mike, we're skipping this thing to stop

194
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,310
阻止那混蛋在法庭上难为她
that asshole from going after her in open court.

195
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,490
这我知道  只是当你很在意某人时
I get that. It's just that when someone is special to you,

196
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,270
你的判断会...出现偏差
it can...mess up your judgment.

197
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,330
等我需要你对我的私生活发表意见时
And when I want your advice on my personal life,

198
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,200
我会告诉你  所以除非你觉得你处理不了
I'll ask for it, so unless you think you can't handle it

199
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,740
那我就得让路易去做...
and I have to tell Louis to do it--

200
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,780
我能处理好  哈维
I can handle it, Harvey.

201
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,320
那就赶快去路易办公室忙起来
Then walk yourself down to Louis' office and get ready

202
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,780
因为我们今天就要搞定这个混蛋
because we're shutting this son of a bitch down today.

203
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,680
你好  雪莉  他在吗
Hey, Shelley, is he in?

204
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,740
算了  我自己去瞧瞧
Never mind, I'll just go see for myself.

205
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,060
亚历克斯  等等  他和你有约吗
Alex, wait. Is he expecting you?

206
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,190
我可不想有
I sure as shit hope not.

207
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,640
你当真觉得我会让你
Did you really think I was gonna let you

208
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,090
把我的客户挖走吗
get away with poaching my client?

209
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,380
我没盘算什么  也没想挖人
I didn't think anything, and I'm not poaching anyone

210
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,490
因为我们有协议在先
because we signed an agreement not to touch

211
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,150
我绝不会想去碰你宝贵客户的
any of your precious clients with a 10-foot pole.

212
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,080
不  你只是碰巧要对我最大的客户
No, you just happened to manufacture a hostile takeover

213
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,450
进行恶意收购
of my biggest client.

214
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,500
我的客户做的任何决定
I have a legal obligation to assist my client

215
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,120
我都有法律义务予以协助
in whatever decisions they make,

216
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,230
如果这种义务碰巧让我不小心
and if that obligation happens to result in me

217
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,850
喝到了你的奶昔
drinking your milkshake,

218
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,780
只是附带的好处罢了
well, that's just a side benefit.

219
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,020
在你喝那杯奶昔时  等着被噎着吧
Well, while you're drinking that shake, choke on this.

220
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,740
我的客户要以不正当经销手段起诉你
My client is suing yours for unfair business practices,

221
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,760
联邦贸易委员会是不会让一家起诉
and there's no way the FTC lets a company suing their competitor

222
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,480
某对手的公司被该对手收购的
get acquired by that competitor.

223
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,000
这样的话  你最好再弄一份文件
In that case, you better be ready to file another one

224
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,990
因为这份文件在你回到你的
because this thing is gonna get tossed

225
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,840
小办公室前就会被扔掉
before you get back to your little office.

226
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,970
我准备好了  伊莱  我提醒你
I'm ready, Eli, and in case you forgot,

227
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,160
上次你们俩其中一个和我对着干
the last time one of you two went up against me,

228
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,760
他叫汤米・布莱顿
his name was Tommy Bratton,

229
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,940
不知道你注意到没  他已经不在这工作了
and I don't know if you noticed, he doesn't work here anymore.

230
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,690
起初  我试着一笑而过
At first, I tried to laugh it off,

231
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,320
但是亚瑟不停勾引我  所以我告诉他
but Arthur kept hitting on me, so I told him

232
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,250
我不感兴趣  让他停手
I wasn't interested and asked him to stop.

233
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,610
-他停手了吗  -不  他没有
- And did he? - No, he didn't.

234
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,240
最终  我没有得到他许诺的升职
Finally I didn't get a promotion that I'd been promised.

235
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,460
他说是因为我的绩效审核结果不好
He said it was because of poor performance reviews.

236
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,580
你的理解是
Which you understood to mean

237
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,860
你不肯和他上床
that you wouldn't sleep with him.

238
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,980
没错  当我如此质问他时
Yes. When I accused him of that,

239
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,020
他说如果我再提起这件事  他就解雇我
he said if I brought it up again, I would lose my job.

240
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,970
六周后  我还是被解雇了
Six weeks later, I was fired anyway.

241
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,820
亚瑟・基特里奇让我的生活一团糟
Arthur Kittredge made my life a living hell.

242
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,290
法官大人  控方传唤
Your Honor, the prosecution calls

243
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,990
唐娜・鲍尔森上庭
Donna Paulsen to the stand.

244
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,860
法官大人  我请求证人不得出席
Your Honor, I move to have that witness disallowed.

245
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,520
理由是什么
On what grounds?

246
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,180
理由就是他之所以要传唤证人
On the grounds that he's only calling the witness

247
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,770
是因为他另有所图
because he has a personal ax to grind.

248
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,100
法官大人  我们强烈否认这些指控
Your Honor, we vehemently deny these accusations,

249
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,850
但是这不重要
but it doesn't matter

250
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,880
因为他们所说的并不是歧视
because what they're claiming isn't discrimination.

251
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,010
因为她不肯和他上床  亚瑟・基特里奇
It turned into discrimination the second Arthur Kittredge

252
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,250
就没给她升职机会
passed her over for a promotion

253
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,330
这就是歧视
because she wouldn't sleep with him.

254
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,270
这既过分又惹人气愤
That's outrageous and inflammatory,

255
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,400
即使这是事实  这和公司如何决定
and even if it were true, what does any of it have to do

256
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,580
谁得到抵押贷款利率又有什么关系呢
with how a company determines who gets what mortgage rate?

257
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,630
我在试图向法庭解释
I'm trying to explain to the court

258
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,160
你传唤证人的证词需要保密的原因
why you'd call a witness whose testimony is privileged.

259
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,320
为什么要保密
How exactly is it privileged?

260
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
因为它是某个案子的工作成果  而且这是
Because it's work product, on a case, by the way,

261
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,960
哈维・斯佩克特而不是你名声在外的原因
that made Harvey Specter's name instead of yours,

262
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,000
现在你们想用它来诽谤他的名誉
and now you're trying to use it to smear his reputation.

263
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,730
法官大人  克利福德・丹纳和埃尔蒙特投资
Your Honor, Clifford Danner has nothing to do

264
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,070
一点关系都没有
with Elmont Investments.

265
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,550
唐娜・鲍尔森处理这个案子受到保密协议
Donna Paulsen's work on it is covered under privilege,

266
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,950
这整个案子现在就应该结束
and this entire case should be thrown out right now.

267
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,100
请原谅我的法式口音
And if you'll pardon my French,

268
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,610
这是我听到的最胡扯的话
that is the biggest load of bullshit I have ever heard.

269
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,920
你怎么想是你的事  律师
You can think whatever you want, Counselor,

270
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,440
但是加州第12巡回法庭不这么看
but the 12th Circuit in California felt differently.

271
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,500
法官大人  我们有先例  我们有证词
Your Honor, we have precedent. We have testimony.

272
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,850
-我们有犯罪模式  -斯诺思琪女士
- And we have a pattern. - Ms. Sonowski.

273
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,440
如果你们公司里有
If there is a culture of discrimination

274
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,340
歧视文化
within your company,

275
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,000
执行总裁有责任处理这种情况
the CEO is a reasonable person to ask about it.

276
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,560
24小时后对基特里奇先生进行取证
Mr. Kittredge will submit to a deposition in the next 24 hours.

277
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,700
法官大人  现在名声被
Your Honor, the only reputation

278
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,070
抹黑的人只有我
being smeared here is mine,

279
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,760
但更重要的是  我同意
but more importantly, I agree.

280
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,620
克利福德・丹纳和此案无关
Clifford Danner has nothing to do with this.

281
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,800
事实上  如果有类似的名字
In fact, if anything even remotely resembling

282
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,960
从我嘴里冒出
that name comes out of my mouth,

283
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,050
尽管告我藐视法庭  但如此同时
feel free to hold me in contempt, but in the meantime,

284
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,540
除非被告想提问
unless the defense would like to bring up

285
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,000
我三年级时午餐吃了什么
what I had for lunch in the third grade,

286
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,300
我得传唤我的证人了
I'd like to call my witness.

287
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,900
法官大人...
Your Honor--

288
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,780
保尔森女士  请上证人席
Ms. Paulsen, please take the stand.

289
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,620
保尔森女士  你在当法律秘书之前
Ms. Paulsen, could you please state your employment history

290
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,350
所从事的是什么职业
prior to becoming a legal secretary?

291
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,500
我是个演员
I was an actress.

292
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,960
你能靠演戏养活自己吗
And were you able to make a living at that?

293
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,220
不  我当服务员来增加收入
No, I worked as a waitress to supplement my income,

294
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:09,860
但我不知道这些事...
but I don't see what that has--

295
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,700
你现在收入多少  保尔森女士
And how much do you make now, Ms. Paulsen?

296
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,520
-六位数薪资  -没错
- Somewhere in the six figures? - Yes.

297
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,470
这和起保底工资加小费相比天差地别
That's quite an improvement on minimum wage plus tips,

298
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,550
-你说是不是  -我能怎么说
- wouldn't you say? - What can I say?

299
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,880
我现在工作做的很出色
I'm very good at what I do.

300
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,140
粉碎公司几年前接的
And was shredding a document related

301
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,120
科斯特尔汽车公司案的相关文件
to the Coastal Motors Case that your firm tried years ago

302
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,020
也是你所擅长的工作之一吗
one of the things that you were good at doing?

303
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,880
该死
Oh, shit.

304
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,850
他是怎么知道的
How the hell does he know about that?

305
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,850
不重要了  他已经知道了
Doesn't matter. He knows.

306
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,900
保尔森女士  我再问一次
Ms. Paulsen, I'll ask you again.

307
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,360
你是否销毁了那个案子的证据
Did you destroy evidence on that case?

308
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,930
我要提醒你你宣誓了
And I'll remind you that you're under oath.

309
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,310
反对  他提到的文件是假的
Objection. The document he's referring to was fake.

310
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,680
销毁虚假文件并不犯法
It's not illegal to get rid of fraudulent documents.

311
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,950
她毁掉证据时知道那是伪造的吗
Did she know that when she destroyed it?

312
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,330
这不重要  除非他打算因为
It doesn't matter, so unless he plans

313
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,060
证人做本职工作而起诉她...
to prosecute the witness for doing her job--

314
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,260
我的打算是询问证人
I plan to ask the witness questions.

315
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,210
希望我能有这个机会
I'd like the chance to do that.

316
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,150
-法官大人...  -斯佩克特先生  请安静
- Your Honor-- - Mr. Specter, back off.

317
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,740
由证人来回答问题
The witness will answer the question.

318
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,310
-是  我销毁了文件  -你的上司要你这样做
- Yes, I shredded the file. - At your boss' request.

319
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,180
-不  -鲍尔森女士  你是否
- No. - Ms. Paulsen, were you fired

320
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,230
在科斯特尔汽车一案期间被解雇
during the Coastal Motors trial

321
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,870
并在一周后恢复原职
and then rehired one week later?

322
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,780
-是  但是...  -此后
- Yes, but I-- - And since then,

323
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,600
你成为了事务所的首席运营官
you've become your firm's chief operating officer,

324
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,320
但你并不是律师出身  对吧
but you're not a lawyer, are you?

325
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,750
当首席运营官不需要律师出身
You don't need to be a lawyer to be a COO.

326
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,290
-你有工商管理硕士学位吧  -没有
- And do you have an MBA? - No, I don't.

327
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,580
当然没有
Of course you don't.

328
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,110
你只有戏剧学的学士学位
All you have is a bachelor's in theater,

329
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,260
你成为一名律师秘书之前
and you were a part-time waitress, part-time actress

330
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,680
是一名演员  还兼职做服务员
when you quit to become a legal secretary,

331
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,390
你一直在做这项工作  直到哈维・斯佩克特
which is what you were until Harvey Specter

332
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,220
一夜之间让你当上了首席运营官
made you COO overnight.

333
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,040
告诉我  你有这个职位通常所需要的
Tell me, do you have any of the qualifications

334
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,680
任何资格证书吗
normally required for that position?

335
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,790
我在这家事务所的时间比任何人都长
I have been at the firm longer than anyone.

336
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,830
我知道它是怎样运营的...
I know how it works--

337
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,530
我也知道  不过是
Oh, so do I, by breaking the law

338
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,640
让某些人犯点法  然后再奖励那些人
and then rewarding the people that do.

339
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,430
这是扯谎
That's a lie!

340
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,620
那你是怎样升职的
Well, then how did you get your promotion?

341
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,970
既然你不够格  我只想到了两种方法
Because there's only two ways I can think of

342
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,120
这两种方法可都拿不上台面
when you're not qualified, and they're both pretty distasteful.

343
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,490
反对  这是有意煽动
Objection! That's inflammatory.

344
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,950
请回答问题
Answer the question.

345
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,980
我来告诉你吧  是我自己要求升职的
I'll tell you how I got it. I asked for it.

346
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,200
是你要求的
You asked for it?

347
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,090
如果只是开口要求就可以
You know, if that's all it takes,

348
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,120
那我或许应该管斯佩克特先生要一匹小马
maybe I should ask Mr. Specter for a pony,

349
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,140
但我可不觉得有这么简单
except I don't think that's all it takes.

350
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,160
我觉得这需要你销毁证据  假装被解雇
I think it takes destroying evidence, getting fake fired,

351
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,960
然后再演一出戏  让一切圆满结束
and a little acting ability to pull it off.

352
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,800
-法官大人  他在自证  -那我就
- Your Honor, he's testifying! - Yeah, well,

353
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,040
到此为止了
then I'll wrap it up because

354
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,950
如果她在那件案子中愿意销毁证据
if she was willing to destroy evidence in that case,

355
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,010
她在这件案子中也会愿意
she's willing to do it in this one,

356
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,650
所以那篇文章里提到的备忘
and that is why the memo referred to

357
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,700
已经不见了
in that article no longer exists.

358
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,210
-法官大人...  -够了
- Your Honor-- - I've heard enough.

359
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,590
案子继续进行
This case is moving forward,

360
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,800
那篇文章可以被采纳为证据
and I'm allowing that article to be admitted as evidence.

361
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,540
贾丝敏  我跟你说过最好私下解决
Jasmine, I told you the best way to handle this was quietly.

362
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,270
而我跟你说过
And I told you that man

363
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,320
那个人道德败坏  活该接受取证
deserves to be exposed for what he is.

364
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,180
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know that?

365
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,560
那你为什么不接我的案子
Then why won't you take my case?

366
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,620
因为人们活该怎么样和最后的结果
Because what people deserve and what they get

367
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,970
-不是一回事  -那个说过
- aren't the same thing. - And what happened

368
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,890
要永远保护我的大哥哪去了
to the big brother who said he'd always protect me?

369
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:23,730
我来告诉你怎么回事
I'll tell you what happened.

370
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,680
你说过这件事要按你的方式解决
You told him you were gonna handle this your way.

371
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,640
不  你不肯这样做是因为害怕
No. You won't do this because you're worried

372
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,590
得罪你在那家厉害的事务所里的老板
how it'll look to your bosses at that fancy law firm.

373
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,740
如果真是这样呢
So what if I am?

374
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,650
我拼命努力工作才进了哈佛法学院
I worked my whole life to get into Harvard Law,

375
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,020
那种地方是不会招你我这种人的
and then I got hired at the kind of place

376
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,550
但他们招了我
that doesn't hire people like you and me.

377
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,380
我挤进了一扇本该摔在我脸上的门
I got my toe in a door that's usually slammed in our faces,

378
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,200
但我要是像疯了一样接下这个案子
and if I take a case like this out the gate,

379
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,670
他们立刻就会让我走人
they'll let me go in a heartbeat.

380
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,060
或许吧  但如果你要我...
Maybe they will, but if you ask me--

381
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,590
我没有要你做什么  贾丝敏
I'm not asking you, Jasmine,

382
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,620
但你在要我为了一个不可能
but you're asking me to risk everything

383
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,660
赢的案子赌上一切
for a case that I can't win.

384
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,940
不  罗伯  我要你这样做
No, Robbie, I asked you to do this

385
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,640
是因为那个人毁了我的生活
because that man shattered my life,

386
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,610
我都不知道该怎么振作起来
and I don't know how I'm gonna pick myself up,

387
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,620
但我以为至少可以对簿公堂
but I thought at least I could do this

388
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,400
因为有你支持我
knowing that you had my back.

389
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,100
贾丝敏
Jasmine.

390
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,180
你就让自己顺顺当当进那扇门
You just make sure you get your foot

391
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,950
然后一路高升吧
all the way in that goddamn door.

392
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,840
-哈维  -我知道你要说什么
- Harvey. - I know what you're gonna say,

393
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,000
我们本该举行模拟庭审的
that we should have had the mock trial.

394
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,770
我不想听见这句话
Well, I don't want to hear it.

395
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,550
我没想这么说  哈维  我要说的是
I wasn't gonna say that, Harvey. I was gonna say

396
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,770
如果他再让她出庭作证
that if he puts her on the stand again

397
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,320
-面对同样一个陪审团...  -那就要看上去
- in front of that jury-- - It's gonna look even worse

398
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,470
-比刚才还糟  -詹妮...
- than it did just now? - Jenna--

399
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,150
你别想凭花言巧语逃避这件事
You're not gonna talk your way out of this.

400
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,300
上次我们在那儿的时候
The last time we were in there,

401
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,780
你说过等这一切结束  我们就赢了
you said when it was over, we'd win.

402
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,700
现在不仅赢不了  他还要用一份
Well, instead of us winning, he gets to use a memo

403
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,010
根本不存在的备忘录
that doesn't even exist.

404
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,730
不是不存在  是你根本没写
Not that doesn't exist, that you didn't write.

405
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,780
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

406
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,600
我觉得哈维说的是马利克对你公司的
I think what Harvey's saying is that Malik put the squeeze

407
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,010
某个人施加了压力
on someone in your company,

408
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,570
为了摆脱他  他们就去跟报社说
and to get him off their back, they went to the newspaper

409
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,930
你写过一份备忘
and said there was a memo that you wrote.

410
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,150
就算那是真的
Even if that's true,

411
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,990
你也永远别想找出是谁写的
you're never gonna find out who wrote it.

412
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,390
那就不从给报社提供信息的人入手
Then instead of starting with the person

413
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,110
我们jiu cong 
who gave it to the paper,

414
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,860
接手了这个备忘录的人
we're gonna start with the person they gave it to.

415
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,260
-你好  路易  -别跟我说你好
- Louis, hey. - Don't "Hey" Me.

416
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,990
我想知道为什么我去大办公室
I want to know why I went down to the bullpen

417
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,620
却被告知我自己的律师没法接我的案子
and I was told by own associates that they can't get to my case

418
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,160
因为他们都在忙着给你干活
because every one of them is busy working for you.

419
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,180
因为伊莱・古尔德盯上辉瑞制药了
Because Eli Gould is coming after Pfizer.

420
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,270
糟了  那可是你最大的客户
Shit, that's your biggest client.

421
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,430
-我知道  -你什么时候发现的
- I know. - When'd you figure that out?

422
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,950
昨晚看到这个的时候
Last night when I saw this.

423
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,390
如果我没看错
If I'm reading this right,

424
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,130
在他们去找董事会之前  你还有36小时
you have about 36 hours till they go to the board.

425
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,660
是48小时  我今早提出了第一份诉讼
48. I filed my first suit this morning and gave Eli

426
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,110
让伊莱先跟联邦贸易委员会周旋一会儿
a song and dance about the FTC,

427
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,850
但他不傻  我这样做只能争取一点时间
but he's no fool, and all that does is buy us time.

428
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,820
你要多少律师就拿多少吧
Well, then you take all the associates you need,

429
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,220
因为我们要尽自己所能
'cause we're gonna do whatever it takes

430
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,320
保护委托人
to protect our client.

431
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,940
我们
We?

432
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,700
亚历克斯  我说过你就像家人一样
Alex, I told you, you're family,

433
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:32,880
我绝不会让
and there's no way I'm letting

434
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,600
伊莱亚斯・混蛋古尔德伤害我的家人
Elias Douchebag Gould hurt my family.

435
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,310
乔治・克拉克  我是迈克・罗斯
George Clark? I'm Mike Ross.

436
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,360
就是大卫那篇文章里的人
Oh, the guy David wrote that article about.

437
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,610
而我要以诽谤罪起诉你
And I'm the guy that's gonna sue you for defamation

438
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,620
除非你帮我们一把
unless you help us out.

439
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,750
为什么我要帮助
And why would I help someone out

440
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,530
威胁我的人
who's threatening me?

441
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,520
我不是威胁你  我是在跟你打包票
I'm not threatening. I'm promising.

442
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,460
因为你登载了一篇关于备忘录的报导
Because you ran a story about a memo

443
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,770
声称是我客户所写
that my client supposedly wrote

444
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,630
甚至不给她机会反驳
that you didn't even give her a chance to refute.

445
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,790
我不需要给她机会  我核实过
I didn't need to give her a chance; I had verification.

446
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,580
向谁核实
From who?

447
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,180
这就是你们的目的  想知道我的消息源
That's what this is about. You want my source.

448
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,270
你说对了
You're damn right we do.

449
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,410
我要是说了那在这行就再也混不下去了
And you know, I do that, and I'll never get another one.

450
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,260
等我们证明那便条是假的以后  你能给
And we prove that memo's fake, you'll be lucky getting a job

451
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,790
波托马克新闻报写影评就该谢天谢地了
doing movie reviews for "The Potomac News"

452
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,640
因为那报道不仅暗指我客户有罪
because that article doesn't just imply my client's guilty.

453
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,010
还暗指我包庇此事
It implies that I buried the damn thing.

454
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,460
鉴于消息源的高可信度  你八成包庇了
Well, considering the nature of my source, you probably did.

455
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,440
你刚说什么
What did you just say?

456
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,230
不是埃尔蒙特投资告诉我的
I didn't get it from Elmont Investments.

457
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,660
而是认识你的人告诉我的
I got it from somebody who knows you.

458
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,330
-胡说  不可能  -是认识他的人还是同事
- Bullshit. That's not possible. - Knows him or works with him?

459
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,450
给我消息的人
The person who gave it to me

460
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,560
曾和你们是同事
had a working relationship with both of you.

461
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,390
依我来看  这便是实证
As far as I'm concerned, that's verification,

462
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,410
如果你们还觉得不够的话
and if that's not good enough for you,

463
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,240
那请立刻起诉我
then you go ahead and sue me

464
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,530
我要说的就这么多
because that's all I'm gonna say.

465
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,610
你来了  外卖呢
There you are. Where's the food?

466
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,500
我想我们可以出去吃
I was thinking we could go out to dinner

467
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,750
休息会儿再工作
instead of working through.

468
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,550
不  瑞秋  我们只有一次机会
No. Rachel, we only get one shot at this.

469
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,980
我们得做好充分准备  不能离开
We need to be ready. We can't go out.

470
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,520
我们正在准备取证
We're preparing for this deposition.

471
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,120
如果我说我们根本
And what if I told you that we don't have to do

472
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,310
不必取证呢
a deposition at all?

473
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,640
和解条款  你在开什么玩笑
A settlement offer? You got to be kidding me.

474
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,820
爸  这些条款还算合情合理
Dad, the terms are good.

475
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,790
我不在乎
I don't care how good they are.

476
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,310
只要我和那混蛋面谈  这些条款会更合理
Once I get that bastard in the room, they're gonna get better,

477
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,100
而他们却只和你接触谈论和解
and they only came to you with this

478
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,620
是因为他们深知我根本不屑一顾
because they knew I'd tell them to kiss my ass.

479
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,700
不是他们来找我协商  而是我找他们
Except they didn't come to me. I went to them.

480
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,160
什么  你竟敢出卖我
What? You goddamn undercut me?

481
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,800
我没有出卖你  而是去谈一桩交易
I didn't undercut you. I negotiated a deal

482
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,880
因为我很担心
because I am worried

483
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,950
你去面谈后会发生不好的事
about what'll happen if you get in that room.

484
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,020
你刚对我说什么
What did you just say to me?

485
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,270
你甚至无法和信贷员保持团结协作
You couldn't keep it together with a loan officer.

486
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,670
那要是你和曾伤害过你妹妹的人面对面
How's it gonna go when you're face-to-face

487
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,930
到时会变成怎样的局面
with the man that hurt your sister?

488
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,890
我来告诉你  我会让他乖乖招供
I'll tell you how. I'm gonna crack that man wide open.

489
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,240
亦或是你一败涂地导致我们最终一无所得
Or you'll lose your shit and we'll get nothing.

490
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,580
你都不知道你在说什么
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.

491
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,330
爸  我曾说服某个人去冒一次风险
Dad, I once convinced a man to put his life on the line

492
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,270
而不是接受条款  因为我相信我们会赢
instead of taking an offer because I believed we could win,

493
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,460
而我现在要告诉你  我不认为我们能赢
and I'm telling you, I don't think we can.

494
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,870
瑞秋  我曾选择当一名懦夫
Rachel, I took the coward's way out once before.

495
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,610
我不能重蹈覆辙  我宁可拼一下
I can't do it again, and I'd rather take my shot

496
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,840
也不愿畏而却步  至少虽败犹荣
and go down swinging than walk away from the ring.

497
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,020
好吧
Okay.

498
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,350
那就按你说的办
Then we'll do it your way.

499
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,550
但有一个条件
But on one condition.

500
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,800
险中求胜的人不是你
You're not taking the shot.

501
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,230
得是我
I am.

502
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,680
唐娜  庭上的事顺利吗
Donna, hey, how'd it go in court?

503
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,890
我本应早点问  但我有一堆文档要审查
I would have asked you earlier, but I had a ton of doc review.

504
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,650
路易  我现在真的不想谈这件事
I really don't want to talk about it right now, Louis.

505
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
好吧  发生了什么
Okay. What happened?

506
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,480
很明显有什么地方不对劲
Because obviously something's wrong,

507
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,070
我是你的朋友  我随时愿意帮你
and I'm your friend, so I'm here for you.

508
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,890
-去你的愿意帮我  -什么
- Bullshit you're here for me. - What?

509
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,940
-我曾让你保护我  但你只保护了自己
- I asked you to protect me, but all you did was protect yourself

510
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,380
因为你不想问那些
because you didn't want to ask me

511
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,040
马利克问我的问题
the same kinds of questions that Malik did.

512
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,160
马利克问你的问题是什么意思
What do you mean that Malik did?

513
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,170
迈克需要做的只不过是...
All Mike needed to do was--

514
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,570
他没有问我克利福德・沃特金斯的事
He didn't ask me about Clifford Danner.

515
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,320
而是问科斯特尔汽车公司
He asked me about Coastal Motors.

516
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,250
-天呐  那便条  -对  便条
- Oh, my God, the memo. - Yeah, the memo.

517
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,560
然后他让我出庭作证
And then he put me on that stand,

518
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,730
对我步步紧逼  就像我害怕他如此似的
and he came after me just like I was afraid he would.

519
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,080
唐娜  谁也无法预料到事情会如此发展
Donna, there was no way we could have seen that coming.

520
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,840
我们所能预料的只是  如果他让我作证
What we could have seen coming was, if he got me up there,

521
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,020
他就会扭曲事实  含沙射影编造丑事
he would twist the facts, and he would imply ugly things.

522
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,300
-关于你和哈维  -对  关于我和他
- About you and Harvey? - Yes, about me and Harvey,

523
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,730
总是关于我和哈维
'cause it's always about me and Harvey.

524
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,170
上回是  这回也是...
Last time, this time--

525
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,720
-唐娜...  -去你的  路易
- Donna-- - God damn it, Louis,

526
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,120
我求了你帮我
I begged you to help me.

527
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,980
我还问过  如果你的计划行不通怎么办
I even asked, "What if your plan doesn't work?"

528
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,990
但你没听进去以致马利克问得我惊慌失措
but you didn't listen, so Malik rattled me,

529
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,410
他还羞辱我
and he humiliated me.

530
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,370
他说我是在一夜之间
And he said I am only COO

531
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,420
摇身一变成为首席运营官
because I slept my way there,

532
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,210
还说得有模有样
and he made it sound plausible,

533
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,310
因为你  现在这些都被记录在案
so now that's on the record thanks to you.

534
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,390
我  哈维和我一样是同意这计划的
Me? Harvey signed off on this just as much as I did.

535
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,630
我不管哈维做了什么  路易
I really don't care what Harvey did, Louis,

536
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,650
因为我是求你帮忙  你却让我深陷困境
because I came to you for help, and you left me high and dry.

537
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,040
路易  抱歉
Louis, forgive me,

538
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,530
但我不懂你为什么这么生气
but I don't understand what you're so upset about.

539
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,400
我生气是因为唐娜怒斥我
I'm upset because Donna laid into me

540
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,330
就像整件事都是我的错似的
like the whole thing was my fault.

541
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,130
路易  难道你不明白她只是在发泄吗
Louis, don't you see she was just venting?

542
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,280
我不管
I don't care.

543
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,560
我提供了十分安全的方法来防止她出庭
I gave them a foolproof way to get her out of testifying

544
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,280
是他们搞砸的  不是我
and they dropped the ball, not me.

545
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,860
如果真的是这样  那这事
If that's true, this shouldn't be

546
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,480
理应无法对你产生这么大的影响
affecting you so much.

547
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,170
所有这事肯定有原因
So there has to be an explanation

548
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,940
你之所以这么生气
as to why you're so upset,

549
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,930
也许是因为你没有如你保证般
and perhaps it has to do with you not going through

550
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,650
完成这模拟审判
with the mock trial like you promised you would.

551
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,320
这是关于她的  不是我
This is about her, not me.

552
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,160
你不觉得当你对自身感到羞愧时
You don't think that questioning someone

553
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,980
询问别人的亲密关系
about their intimate relations

554
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,170
可能会让你大动肝火吗
when you're feeling shame about your own might touch a nerve?

555
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,200
我不信
I don't believe this.

556
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,740
你是指这和希拉有关
You're saying this is about Sheila?

557
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,240
我是说可能
I'm positing it might be.

558
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,890
那我得说让我大动肝火的是
Well, I'm positing what touches a nerve

559
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,930
我本是来寻求帮助的
is that I come to you for help,

560
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,900
你却说这全是我的错
and you're saying this is all my fault.

561
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,800
我并没有这么说  路易
I'm not saying it's your fault, Louis,

562
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,430
我试着在帮你
and I'm trying to help you.

563
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,310
胡说
Bullshit.

564
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,620
路易  你知道我会尽可能地帮你
Louis, you know I would do anything I could to help you.

565
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,460
你不会  与其等你告诉我剩下的
Well, you're not, and instead of waiting for you

566
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,670
会谈时间不多了
to tell me that my time is up,

567
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,600
我准备现在开始保护自己
I'm gonna go ahead and protect myself

568
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,880
离开这个鬼地方
and get the hell out of here.

569
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,810
如果他们认识我们  那范围就能缩小了
Okay, if they know us, that narrows it down.

570
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,360
对  缩小到一千人至两千人左右
Yeah, to 1,000 or 2,000 people.

571
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,840
这一两千人并不全都在我们手下工作过
1,000 or 2,000 people didn't used to work for us.

572
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,600
这根本说不通
You know what? This doesn't make any sense.

573
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,490
我们一周前才开始处理这个案子
We've just had this case for a week.

574
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,680
如此说来  那个人现在就在这里工作
By that logic, it would have to be someone who works here now.

575
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,870
也可能是时不时在这里工作的人
Or it could be someone who works here from time to time.

576
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,250
你是指谁  唐娜
What are you getting at, Donna?

577
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,510
我指霍莉・科伦维尔
I'm getting at Holly Cromwell.

578
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,870
他为什么会去找霍莉
Why would he go to Holly?

579
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,450
因为那个记者会相信她能拿到东西
Because that reporter would believe that she has access.

580
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,640
如果马利克想找人
If Malik needed to enlist someone to do

581
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,550
做这种事  谁更合适
something like this, who better to do it?

582
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,210
而且最重要的是  她对我们都没好感
And on top of that, she has no love for any of us.

583
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,460
如果这是真的  马利克就从
If what you're saying is true, Malik just went from

584
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,780
胁迫别人变成了伪造证据
strong-arming someone to fabricating evidence.

585
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,780
不  他没有
No, he didn't.

586
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,550
我的天  这家伙真厉害
Jesus Christ, this guy's good.

587
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,560
这是什么意思
What are you saying?

588
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,260
他只是给了记者一个故事
All he did was give a story to a reporter.

589
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,960
这不叫伪造证据
That's--that's not fabricating evidence.

590
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,130
这甚至算不上犯罪
That's not even a crime.

591
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,690
他知道那是伪造的  而在庭审上承认了
Well, he admitted it at trial knowing it was false,

592
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,740
这当然是犯罪
and that sure as hell is.

593
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,480
哈维  他什么都没承认
Harvey, he didn't admit anything.

594
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,420
是我们承认了  因为他设套让我们这么做
We did, because he baited us into doing it.

595
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,520
他举起报纸装作要开始陈述
He held up the newspaper as if he was about to enter it,

596
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,560
但随后他说"文件"
but then he said "Document"

597
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,320
另一只手又举起了一份材料
and held up a folder with the other hand.

598
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,170
唐娜  我们需要一份文录
Donna, we need a transcript

599
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,700
确保迈克说的是真的
to make sure what Mike's saying is true.

600
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,610
我不需要文录  哈维
I don't need a transcript, Harvey.

601
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,660
我在脑子里都记下来了
I've got it all right here.

602
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,240
我告诉你  文章里提到了你
I'm telling you, you entered that article.

603
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,070
这或许不是犯罪
Well, it may not be a crime,

604
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,950
但如果霍莉站出来  他就会败露
but if Holly comes forward, he's gonna lose,

605
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,460
意味着我得马上去找霍莉
which means I'm going over there right now.

606
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,660
-不  哈维  我去找她  -唐娜  最初
- No, Harvey, I am. - Donna, you were the one

607
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,510
就是你当面拒绝她来这里工作
who made her refuse to come here in the first place.

608
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,410
她绝不会听你的
She'll never listen to you.

609
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,280
哈维  那个混蛋羞辱我
Harvey, that son of a bitch humiliated me

610
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,130
告诉世界我不配身居高位
and told the world I don't deserve my job.

611
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,640
我不只要证明他错了
I don't want to just prove him wrong.

612
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,870
我要让他后悔遇见了我
I want to make him regret he ever met me.

613
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,740
-准备好进行取证了吗  -随时准备着
- Ready for your deposition? - As ready as I'll ever be.

614
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,130
这计划很棒  瑞秋  会成功的
It's a good plan, Rachel. It should work.

615
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,130
你想跟我一起走吗
Do you want to head up there with me?

616
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,240
我可以载你一程
I can drop you off on the way.

617
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,470
不  你去吧
No, no, you go ahead.

618
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,940
去之前我有些事情要处理
I got something I want to take care of before I head in.

619
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,170
马利克的案子吗
Malik case?

620
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,090
事实上  是宝拉・阿加德
Actually, Paula Agard.

621
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,230
她在半个小时前打过电话来
Yeah, she called about a half hour ago.

622
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,190
她想送哈维特别的礼物
She wants to get Harvey something special,

623
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,200
问我有没有什么主意
wanted to know if I had any ideas.

624
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,060
-她为什么打电话给你  -我不知道
- Why did she call you? - I don't know.

625
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,340
我猜或许她认为我是哈维最好的朋友
I guess maybe she thinks that I'm Harvey's best friend.

626
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,750
也或许因为最了解哈维的那个人
Or maybe because the person that knows Harvey the best

627
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,200
是她唯一绝不会通话的人
is the only person she'll never call.

628
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,400
好吧  你在想什么
Okay. Got something on your mind?

629
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,730
唐娜有一天晚上来这里
It's just, Donna was here the other night,

630
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,200
告诉我多年以前有过一个人
and she told me about this guy from years ago and...

631
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,080
但她选择了哈维而不是他
she chose Harvey over him,

632
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,020
我问她是否后悔  然后...
and I asked her if she regretted it, and--

633
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,990
-然后什么  -这让我在想
- And what? - I guess it just made me wonder

634
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,090
真正让她后悔的是不是
if what she really regrets

635
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,300
她从未告诉哈维她的感受
is never telling Harvey how she feels.

636
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,740
无论如何  我得走了
Anyway, I've got to get going.

637
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,040
-路易  我们有麻烦了  -这次又是什么
- Louis, we have a problem. - What is it now?

638
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,630
我使劲浑身解数对付古尔德  全都落空了
I threw everything in the book at Gould. None of it worked.

639
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,420
更糟糕的是  他们还加快了行动速度
On top of that, they just moved up the timeline.

640
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,550
那你需要联系董事会
Then you're gonna need to contact the board

641
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,570
提议法人调整
about a corporate amendment.

642
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,540
路易  我是说我们想尽了一切办法
Louis, I'm telling you we've looked at everything:

643
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,030
绝对多数制  金色降落伞  毒丸计划
supermajority, golden parachute, poison pill.

644
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,890
"皇冠之珠"的办法怎么样
What about the crown jewels?

645
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:56,760
你深入他们的各个部门
You go through their divisions,

646
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,980
找出最脆弱的那一个
and you find the one that's most valuable.

647
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,000
我懂"皇冠之珠"防御策略是怎么回事  路易
I know what the crown jewel defense is, Louis.

648
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,770
问题在于  即使我能找到买家同意条款
The problem is, even if I could find a buyer and agree to terms,

649
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,350
我们也赶不及完成此事
there's no way we could push it through in time.

650
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,410
等等  我们不需要赶着完成
Wait a second. We don't need to push it through in time.

651
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,570
我们只用让他们以为我们完成了
We just need to make them think we did.

652
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,710
你疯了吗  纸包不住火
Are you crazy? A bluff is never gonna work.

653
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,530
他们认识全国所有的合法买家
They know every legitimate buyer in the country.

654
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,420
我没说要找合法买家
I am not talking about a legitimate buyer,

655
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,110
也当然不是说要找
and I am definitely not talking about them

656
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,220
美国的买家
being from this country.

657
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,830
-你来这里干嘛  -我来是为了
- What are you doing here? - I'm here to apologize

658
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,450
我俩上次见面发生的事向你道歉
for what happened the last time we met.

659
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,950
你来是因为有所诉求
You're here because you want something.

660
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,220
你说得对  但请听我说完
You're right. I do, but please just hear what I have to say.

661
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,930
你有三十秒时间
You have 30 seconds.

662
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,440
你告诉我你找到引人注目的东西
You told me that you find out what makes people tick

663
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,930
然后利用它来得到自己想要的
and you use that to get what you want

664
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,620
这能奏效是因为人们无视大局
and it works because people don't see the bigger picture.

665
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,830
-没错  -你没告诉我的是
- That's right. - What you didn't tell me

666
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,260
你学到这招
was that you learned how to do that

667
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,430
是因为你的继父是个酒鬼
because your stepfather's an alcoholic,

668
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,300
所以你学会读懂人心
so you learned to read people

669
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:53,160
成为他们想让你成为的人  以保护自己
and be who they want you to be to protect yourself.

670
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,330
这不是用来评判你的理由
That's not something to judge you for.

671
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,130
好吧  我接受你的道歉
Okay. I accept your apology,

672
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,470
但我不能做你请求的事
but I can't do what you're here to ask.

673
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,820
他手里有你的把柄  对吗
He has something on you, doesn't he?

674
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,670
我的人生并非一清二白  唐娜
I haven't exactly led a crime-free life, Donna.

675
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,600
所以  请原谅我...
Now, if you will excuse me--

676
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,670
不管他有你什么把柄  我们都能为你辩护
We can defend you against anything he has on you.

677
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,890
我不能冒这个险  因为鉴于你刚才承认
I can't risk that. Because given the history

678
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,650
曾用来评判我的这段黑历史
you just admitted you judged me for,

679
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,400
如果我所面对的陪审团里有个女人相信这个
if I ever stand in front of a jury with women on it--

680
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,430
霍莉  拜托  我们需要你帮忙
Holly, please. We need this.

681
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,400
对不起  唐娜
I'm sorry, Donna.

682
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,040
如果我能帮你肯定帮  但我办不到
If I could help you, I would, but I can't.

683
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,000
基特里奇先生  贵公司90%的高管都是男性
Mr. Kittredge, 90% of your executives are male.

684
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,350
-对吗  -我不知道
- Is that correct? - I wouldn't know.

685
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,410
我以工作表现来评估员工
I evaluate my employees

686
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,700
而不是性别
based on their work and not their gender.

687
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,430
那他们的肤色呢
And what about the color of their skin?

688
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,770
我想你和丽莎・戴维斯见过面了
I believe you had a meeting with Lisa Davies.

689
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,940
她是我们的高级信贷员之一
She's one of our senior loan officers.

690
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,320
你是说你委派以掩盖自己罪行的那个有色女人吗
You mean the woman of color you sent in to hide your crime?

691
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,840
这怎么回事  我以为我到这里
What is this? I thought I was here

692
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,930
回答一些关于贷款流程的问题
to answer some questions about our loan process.

693
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,660
我会问的  但首先我想
And I'll get to that, but first I would like

694
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,870
问你关于艾丽西娅・泰勒的事
to ask you about Alicia Taylor.

695
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,240
-谁  -因为她不跟你上床
- Who? - The woman that you fired

696
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,290
而被你解雇的那个女人
because she wouldn't sleep with you.

697
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,600
你确实这样做过  对吗
You did do that, didn't you?

698
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,530
艾丽西娅・泰勒与本案无关
Alicia Taylor has no bearing on this case.

699
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,790
她是本案的问题所在
She's everything that's wrong with this case.

700
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,520
抱歉  你有什么要问的吗
I'm sorry. Is there a question?

701
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,260
是的
Yes.

702
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,490
迷人女性们会吓到你吗  亚瑟
Do attractive women intimidate you, Arthur?

703
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,910
不  这怎么会
No, why would they?

704
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,670
因为她们坚强又强势
Because they're strong and they're powerful

705
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,150
知道自己想要什么
and they know what they want.

706
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,160
我对女性员工或其他员工都一视同仁
I value my female employees like anyone,

707
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,150
你也没证据反驳
and you have no proof otherwise.

708
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,940
那请回答我的问题或者引用第五修正案
Then answer the question or take the fifth.

709
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,600
你是否曾试图和某人上床
Have you ever tried to sleep with someone

710
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,120
然后她们要是拒绝你  你就报复
and then retaliated once they rejected you?

711
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,680
答案是不  我没有
The answer is no. I haven't.

712
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,660
当然对于不是我手下的女人  情况也不一样
Of course, things are different for women who don't work for me.

713
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,090
比如我马上就会约你
I'd ask you out in a second.

714
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,890
-你注意点  -爸  我搞的定
- Watch yourself. - Dad, I've got this.

715
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,490
没关系的  我知道他是谁
It's all right. I know where he's coming from.

716
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,460
毕竟  他是你爸爸  人也不瞎
I mean, after all, he's your father, but he's not blind.

717
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,980
他知道你有多迷人
I mean, he knows you're attractive.

718
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,050
-阿瑟  -其实
- Arthur. - As a matter of fact,

719
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,350
要我说了算  我很乐意
if it were up to me, I'd be willing

720
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,570
先约一发  也可能两发
to settle this for one date, maybe two.

721
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,480
好了  够了
All right, that's enough.

722
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,370
这就是讽刺之处
You see, that is the irony here.

723
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,300
你们控告我歧视
I am being accused of discriminating

724
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,640
有色人种
against people of color

725
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,370
但其实我更喜欢有色女性
when in fact I have always preferred women of color.

726
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,800
就是喜欢他们这种
There's just something about them.

727
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
异域风情
You know, they're exotic.

728
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,060
-就像你一样  赞恩小姐  -你个混蛋
- Like you, Ms. Zane-- - You son of a bitch,

729
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,680
我要确保身败名裂的人是你
I'm gonna make sure you're the one that loses everything

730
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,360
而不是那些你觊觎的人
and not the people that you prey upon.

731
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,790
-爸  -像你妹妹那样的吗
- Dad. - You mean people like your sister?

732
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,410
-说的就是她  -爸
- You're goddamn right I do! - Dad.

733
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,930
我妹妹是我的一切  而你抹杀了她的光亮
My sister meant everything to me, and you stole her light,

734
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,640
如果我最后只能做一件事
and I'm gonna make sure that you pay for it

735
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,930
那一定是让你为此付出代价
if it's the last thing I do.

736
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,410
那我怕这起诉讼你是办不到了
Well, I'm afraid it's not gonna be with this suit

737
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,080
因为你刚承认了
because you just admitted it's nothing more

738
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,580
这根本就是一场蓄意报复  我们也录音了
than a trumped-up vendetta, and we have it on record.

739
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,760
我花了好一会儿才记起来的  不过一旦想起了
Took me a while to remember, but once I did,

740
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,530
我就知道该怎么治你了
I knew exactly how to take care of you.

741
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,050
她说什么
What did she say?

742
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,670
说她就是信息源
That she was the source.

743
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,280
让我猜猜  但她不肯出庭作证
But let me guess, she won't testify.

744
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,810
她不肯  但我会的
No, she won't, but I will.

745
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,750
唐娜
Donna--

746
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,180
她承认了他联系过她
She admitted that he contacted her.

747
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,340
你说过这就是我们需要的
That's what you said we needed.

748
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,390
我说我需要她去说  不是你
I said I needed her to say it, not you.

749
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,350
为什么不能是我
Well, why can't it be me?

750
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,750
我的话和她的一样
My word is as good as hers.

751
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,300
-那不重要  -为什么
- It doesn't matter. - Why not?

752
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,390
因为在目前的情况下  不一样
Because in this situation, it isn't.

753
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,130
你是指他搞的好像
You mean the situation where he made it look like

754
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,250
我什么都肯为你做因为我...
I would do anything for you because I--

755
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,410
我不管他搞成什么样子
I don't care what he made it look like.

756
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,900
都不是真的
It's not true.

757
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,740
我非常非常想报复回去
I wanted to get back at him so badly.

758
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,590
而且也希望是由我来动手
And I wanted to be the one to do it.

759
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,700
-确实是由你来动的手  -怎么说
- You were the one to do it. - How?

760
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,220
你想到了是霍莉  但事实是
You realized it was Holly, and the truth is,

761
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,670
不管谁开口  她都不会答应的
she was never gonna say yes no matter who asked.

762
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,810
那我们怎么办
So what are we gonna do?

763
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,930
迈克和我要用你给我们的东西
Mike and I are gonna use what you gave us

764
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,750
给安德鲁・马利克点苦头吃吃
to put a gun to Andrew Malik's head,

765
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,210
如果我们用对了的话
and if we do it right,

766
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,650
他会后悔见到你
he is gonna regret the day he met you.

767
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,340
好的  我早上再打给你  妈妈
Okay, I'll call you in the morning, Mom.

768
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,440
多少睡一会儿
Try to get some sleep.

769
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,800
罗伯特  发生什么了
Robert, what's wrong?

770
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,510
贾丝敏两个小时前去世了
Jasmine died two hours ago.

771
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,860
罗伯特  真遗憾
Oh, Robert, I'm so sorry.

772
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,030
我本来可以帮她的
I could have helped her.

773
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,060
我应该帮她的
I should have helped her.

774
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,420
-别  别这样对自己  -对自己怎样
- No, don't do that to yourself. - Do what?

775
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,120
面对现实吗
Face the truth?

776
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,720
那个人毁了她的一生  我却袖手旁观
That man ruined her life, and I did nothing.

777
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,090
过去的两年  你已经在尽全力
You were there for her in every way possible

778
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,570
帮助她陪伴她了
for the last two years.

779
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,350
她也不是因为那件事而死的  她是病死的
She didn't die from that. She died 'cause she got sick.

780
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,600
但她求我那次我没答应
But I wasn't there the one time she had asked,

781
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,430
如果我答应了
and maybe if I was--

782
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,880
我做完作业啦
I finished my homework!

783
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,740
爸爸  你还好吗
Daddy, are you okay?

784
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,700
爸爸听到了坏消息  甜心
Daddy got some bad news, sweetheart,

785
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
我们让他自己静一静
so why don't we give him a minute?

786
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,600
我看你一直在想事情
I keep catching you lost in thought.

787
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,630
我一直在想这件案子
I keep thinking about this goddamn case.

788
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,030
我也是
So was I.

789
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,690
希望你想到了点什么
Well, I hope you got something

790
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,270
因为我就像你担心的那样
'cause I really shit the bed in there,

791
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,880
搞砸了
just like you were afraid I would.

792
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,470
爸
Dad--

793
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,950
我们应该接受那个提议的  瑞秋
We should have taken that deal, Rachel.

794
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,980
你是对的
You were right.

795
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,610
也可能不是
Maybe not.

796
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,740
事实上  可能你还是应该
In fact, maybe you should have that one-on-one

797
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,340
和基特里奇单独谈谈的
with Kittredge after all.

798
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,170
你的意思是
What are you getting at?

799
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,630
我在想  他利用你的弱点来攻我们
I was thinking he used your weakness against us,

800
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,530
那我们为什么不用他的弱点去攻他呢
so why don't we use his weakness against him?

801
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,550
我们对那个取证  不就是这个意思吗
Isn't that what we tried to do with that deposition?

802
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,750
就像你以前周末吼电视的时候那样
Yeah, but like you used to yell at the TV on Sundays,

803
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,160
如果正面对抗行不通
if running it up the middle isn't working,

804
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,330
那就帮大家个忙  去做长传吧
then do us all a goddamn favor and call an end-around.

805
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,610
那些比赛你还真是认真听了啊
You were really listening to all those games, weren't you?

806
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,090
不是比赛  爸爸
Not the games, Dad.

807
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,420
我听的是你说的那些话
I was listening to you.

808
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,860
迈克  你来干什么
Mike, what are you doing here?

809
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,110
我以为你和哈维要去见马利克
I thought you and Harvey were going to see Malik.

810
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,700
是的  不过要在一小时后
We are, just not for another hour.

811
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,160
只是想和你聊聊
Just wanted to talk to you about- 

812
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,040
说什么
What is it?

813
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,360
唐娜  瑞秋告诉我
Donna, Rachel told me

814
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,340
我因为洛根・桑德斯的事搬出去的时候
that when I moved out because of Logan Sanders,

815
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,200
是你告诉她要给我点空间
you told her to give me some space

816
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,380
因为车到山前必有路
because things work out the way that they're supposed to.

817
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,740
-但她没有  -这就是我要说的
- But she didn't do that. - Well, that's my point.

818
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,440
迈克  你带着这个要去哪里
Mike, where are you going with this?

819
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,920
去告诉哈维你是怎么想的
Tell Harvey how you feel.

820
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,400
什么
What?

821
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,040
我知道我没有立场说这些  但是唐娜
I know that it's not my place to say this, but, Donna,

822
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,550
如果不是你  我不会和瑞秋在一起
I wouldn't be with Rachel if it wasn't for you,

823
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,290
如果我让你丢了某样东西  让你不能
and if I let you lose something that might make you

824
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,630
和我们一样开心
as happy as we are

825
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,530
而我还无动于衷的话  我永远不会原谅自己
and I didn't say something, I would never forgive myself.

826
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,830
所以如果你觉得  哪怕有一丝可能
So if you think there is even the smallest chance

827
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,340
你有想过要和他在一起
that you might ever want to be together

828
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,970
但你又没有那么快告诉他
and you don't tell him that soon,

829
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,270
那你可能就再也开不了这个口了
you might lose the chance to tell him at all.

830
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,650
迈克...
Mike...

831
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,840
我感谢你的一番心意
I appreciate where your heart is,

832
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,230
但两个人在一起要两厢情愿才能开心
but two people have to want to be together to be happy,

833
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,800
而哈维和我不想在一起
and Harvey and I don't want to be together.

834
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,080
你确定吗
Are you sure?

835
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,860
我确定
I'm sure.

836
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,680
-你想让我怎么做  -你之前说过
- You want me to do what? - You said before that

837
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,780
只要你力所能及就都会帮我
you would do anything in your power to help me.

838
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,270
现在我开口了
Well, now I'm asking.

839
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,890
路易  我是说在这间办公室里  你明知道
Louis, I meant in this office, and you know it.

840
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,110
你叫我假扮成别人
You're asking me to pretend to be someone I'm not,

841
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,930
这超越了我的执照权限
which is a violation of my license.

842
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,720
蒙利诉玛洛湾案不是这么说的
Not according to Munley v. Marowan, it's not.

843
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,820
我不知道这是什么
I don't know what that is.

844
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,890
因为你是一个心理医生而不是律师
Well, that's 'cause you're a psychiatrist and not a lawyer,

845
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,250
但是我需要你假装
but what I need you to be

846
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,750
一名德国制药公司代表
is the head of a German pharmaceutical company.

847
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,350
-路易  -斯坦  拜托
- Louis!  - Stan, please.

848
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,380
我已经让唐娜失望了
I already let Donna down,

849
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,730
而我又无法弥补
and I can't do anything to help that,

850
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,370
如果我一天两次让我在乎的人失望
and if I let someone down that I care about twice in two days, 

851
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,050
我算什么合伙人
what kind of partner am I?

852
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,760
更重要的是  我算什么朋友
More importantly, what kind of friend?

853
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,100
路易  抱歉
Louis, I'm sorry.

854
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,300
不管是否超越我执照权限
Violation of my license or not,

855
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,520
你的要求不合职业道德
what you're asking me to do is unethical,

856
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,730
我不会做
and I won't do it.

857
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,740
怎样
Well?

858
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,540
抱歉  亚历克斯  他拒绝了
I'm sorry, Alex. He said no.

859
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,530
你们是来和解的吗
Well, did you come to cut a deal?

860
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,130
只要包含你认输我获胜
'Cause I'm all ears as long as it includes

861
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,000
我就洗耳恭听
an admission that you lost and I won.

862
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,700
我们来讨论坦白的
Oh, we're here to talk about an admission,

863
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,810
但不是你想的那样
but not the kind you think.

864
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,070
我们来讨论你坦白
Yeah, we're here to discuss an admission

865
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,010
在法庭捏造证据
of fabricated evidence into court by you.

866
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,030
我不知道你们在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

867
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,980
我没做过
I did no such thing.

868
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,040
我们知道你没做
We know you didn't do it yourself.

869
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,600
你让两个傻瓜帮你做的
You had two idiots do it for you.

870
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,930
如果你这么承认的话  哈维
If it's all the same to you, Harvey,

871
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,910
实际上我不认为自己是傻瓜
I actually don't consider myself an idiot.

872
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,080
有道理  你是想出来他诱导我们
Ah, you have a point. You were the one who figured out

873
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,760
为他带进来报纸的那个
he baited us into entering that newspaper for him.

874
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,800
但说实话  是唐娜想明白
But, to be fair, though, it was Donna who figured out

875
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,670
他找了霍莉・科伦维尔
that he went to Holly Cromwell

876
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,520
因为这样一切都更可信了
because it gave the whole thing credibility.

877
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,520
给别人一份报纸又要他放在某处
It's not a crime to give someone a piece of paper

878
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,200
不算是犯罪
and have them drop it off at an address.

879
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,800
但是在法庭上撒谎是犯罪
But it is a crime to lie about it under oath,

880
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,020
我会让你出庭作证
and I'm gonna put you on that stand.

881
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,770
你不能强迫我为自己的案子作证
You can't force me to testify in my own case.

882
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,070
恐怕当你质疑哈维品格的时候
I'm afraid you opened the door to that one

883
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,670
就为此打开了渠道
when you made Harvey's character an issue,

884
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,530
因为如果他品格有问题  你也有问题
because if his character's at issue, then why isn't yours?

885
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,920
我没有违反法律
Look, I broke no laws,

886
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,600
我们都知道珍妮特・斯坦格有罪
and we all know that Janet Stanger is guilty.

887
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,450
如果她有罪而你又像自己以为的那样厉害
And if she's guilty and you're as good as you think you are,

888
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,770
你该不用设计这些把戏
you should have gotten her convicted

889
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,740
就让她认罪
without planting that bullshit.

890
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,000
现在呢  安迪
So which is it, Andy:

891
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,560
你想在庭上被羞辱
do you want to be humiliated on the stand,

892
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,650
还是现在放弃这个案子
or do you want to drop this case right now,

893
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,690
你操纵证据的混蛋
you evidence-manufacturing piece of shit?

894
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,530
阿瑟  感谢你即时见我
Arthur, I appreciate you meeting me on such short notice.

895
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,140
我也感谢让别人
And I appreciate the opportunity

896
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,140
跪在我面前的机会
to have somebody grovel at my feet.

897
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,010
我知道我们现在的处境
Look, I know the position we're in.

898
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,310
事实上  法官还没裁定你的动议
The fact is, the judge hasn't ruled on your motion yet, and--

899
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,800
你想要和解
You want a settlement.

900
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,890
我只是想
I'm just talking about something

901
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,190
在我客户面前留住脸面
that allows me to save face with my clients.

902
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,400
我说了  我感谢别人
As I said, I appreciate the opportunity

903
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,220
跪在我面前的机会
to have someone grovel at my feet.

904
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,990
这是什么
What the hell is this?

905
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,460
这是你们要赔偿的金额
That's what you're going to pay us.

906
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,580
这是之前的三倍
This is three times what it was before.

907
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,980
我知道  因为现在你们知道了
I know, because as of now, you've been notified

908
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,270
阿瑟・克特里奇的行为
of Arthur Kitredge's behavior,

909
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,940
意味着下次再有这种情况
which means the next time it happens,

910
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,460
你们都负个人责任
you're all personally liable.

911
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,510
狗改不了吃屎
A man who did this once is gonna do it again.

912
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,370
你混蛋  这行不通
You son of a bitch, this is not gonna work.

913
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,310
不敢苟同  不知道你有没有注意到
Oh, I beg to differ because I don't know if you noticed,

914
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,220
今天只有我来了
but it's just me here today.

915
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,910
那又怎样
So what?

916
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,400
我们在这里的时候  我女儿
So while we're here, my daughter, 

917
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
那个你认为在董事会面前不敢开口的女人
the woman you wouldn't think could hold her own in a boardroom,

918
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,700
她现在就在你的董事会
she's with your board right now

919
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,570
解释你怎样不值得留任
explaining how you're not worth it anymore.

920
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,580
鉴于你们最近没有出过庭
Because in case you haven't been in a courtroom recently,

921
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,270
大部分陪审团成员不是有钱年长的白人
most juries aren't made up of rich, old white men.

922
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,600
-胡说  -你在吓唬人
- Bullshit. - You're bluffing.

923
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,710
-不是胡说  我们在你之前带着
- It's not bullshit. We got to them before you did

924
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,040
一锤子买卖报价找了他们
with a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

925
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,880
选择在你们
The choice is yours.

926
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,470
你们接受和解  撤职首席执行官
You take the settlement and you remove your CEO...

927
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,600
要么去跟你不一路的陪审团面前碰运气
Or you could roll the dice with a jury not of your peers.

928
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,270
不管怎样  你都完了
Either way, you are done.

929
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,580
哈维  怎么了
Harvey, hey, what's going on?

930
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,900
别告诉我马利克想逃掉协议
Don't tell me that Malik tried to weasel out of that agreement.

931
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,320
不是  都很好  我只是想让你顺路过来
No, it's all good. I just wanted to stop by and say

932
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,610
为你一开始拿给我这个案子道声谢
thank you for bringing me this case in the first place.

933
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,170
这意味着我们为监狱的事扯平了吗
Does that mean we're even for the prison thing?

934
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,780
扯平了
We're even.

935
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,460
谢谢  迈克
Thanks, Mike.

936
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,770
哈维
Harvey...

937
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,140
你昨晚后和唐娜谈话了吗
did you talk to Donna since last night?

938
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,990
没  只发短信说我们赢了  怎么了
No, other than to text her we won. Why?

939
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,340
-没什么  -别担心  迈克
- Nothing. - Don't worry, Mike.

940
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,720
我知道她这几天过得很难
I know she's had a rough time.

941
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,250
我会告诉她我们教训了马利克
I'll tell her we stuck it to Malik

942
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,760
而且她功不可没
and we couldn't have done it without her.

943
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,470
我正希望你还在
I was hoping you'd still be here.

944
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,180
你想干什么  亚历克斯
What do you want, Alex?

945
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,290
给你一直想要的东西
To give you what you wanted all along,

946
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,460
我下跪乞求
me on my knees begging.

947
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,040
-继续说  -你赢了  伊莱
- I'm listening. - You won, Eli.

948
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,080
我不能阻止你抢走辉瑞制药
I can't stop you from taking Pfizer,

949
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,860
但这不关乎他们或者汤米・布莱顿什么的
but this wasn't about them or Tommy Bratton or anything else.

950
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,370
而因为我的离开
This was about me leaving,

951
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,380
现在我愿意做任何事
and now I'm asking what it will take

952
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,280
让你远离我的律所
to get you to back off my firm.

953
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,920
那好
Okay, then...

954
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,530
皮-斯可以留着辉瑞制药
Pearson Specter can keep Pfizer,

955
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,160
你只要带着你所有的客户
and all you have to do is come back here

956
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,060
回到这里
with every other client you have.

957
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,860
这才是你一直想要的  不是吗
That's what you wanted all along, isn't it?

958
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,850
你让你的客户找我客户的麻烦  让我陷入
You had your client go after mine to put me in the position

959
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,400
坑哈维的境地
of having to screw Harvey over.

960
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,110
正是
That's right.

961
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,380
那份协议阻止了我挖人
That agreement may have stopped me from poaching,

962
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,900
但总会有别的办法
but there's always a workaround.

963
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,080
所以呢  在那里作为丢了
So which is it, stay there a diminished man

964
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,470
最大客户的弱者
without your best client

965
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,490
还是回到属于你的地方
or come back here where you belong?

966
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,100
告诉你吧  伊莱
You know what, Eli?

967
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,140
我想我会呆在现在的地方
I think I'm gonna stay exactly where I am,

968
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,270
皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特
at Pearson Specter Litt,

969
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,080
还有我所有的客户
with every damn one of my clients.

970
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,600
-什么  -你刚承认
- Excuse me? - You just admitted

971
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,760
你策划了接管企图
that you orchestrated a takeover attempt

972
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,020
唯一目的就是违反协议
for the sole purpose of breaching our agreement.

973
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,250
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

974
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,290
-你算计我  -没错
- You set me up! - That's right.

975
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,520
你抓到我们了  伊莱  现在又丢了
You had us, Eli, and now you don't,

976
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,940
因为如你所说  总有挽回的办法
because like you said, there's always a workaround.

977
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,470
我猜猜
Let me guess.

978
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,720
让你不把它交出去的代价是我欠你一次
The price for you not handing that over is that I owe you one.

979
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,820
瞧瞧现在是谁求饶了
Well, look who's on their knees now.

980
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,900
晚安  伊莱
Good night, Eli.

981
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,920
有需要我会找你
I'll be in touch when I need you.

982
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,030
-成了吗  -大胜
- Did it work? - Like a charm.

983
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,590
感谢上帝  我实在无法
Oh, thank God. I couldn't stand the thought

984
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,270
忍受再次让这里的另一个人失望了
of letting down another person in the office.

985
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,780
路易  我认为
Louis, from what I've seen,

986
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,560
你从来都没让这公司的人失望过
you've never let anyone in this firm down.

987
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,220
我有
Well, I did.

988
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,750
是时候弥补错误了
And it's time I made it right.

989
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,810
你怎么来了  安迪
What are you doing here, Andy?

990
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,380
我来告诉你也许你是赢了官司
I came here to tell you that you may have won the case,

991
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,820
但我还是会报复你的
but I still wanted to get back at you,

992
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,230
所以我打算报复你的导师
so I decided to come after your old mentor.

993
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,730
如果你以为
If you think Cameron Dennis

994
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,360
卡梅隆・丹尼斯解决不了你
can't handle whatever you throw at him,

995
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,580
那你是疯了
you got another thing coming.

996
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,300
我说的不是卡梅隆・丹尼斯
I'm not talking about Cameron Dennis.

997
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,250
我说的是你另一位导师  杰西卡・皮尔逊
I'm talking about your other mentor, Jessica Pearson.

998
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,190
-你干了什么  -不是我
- What did you do? - I didn't do it.

999
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,650
是你  在你让她替你和迈克・罗斯
You did, when you let her take the bullet

1000
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,290
挡枪的时候
for you with Mike Ross.

1001
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,330
安德鲁  此事只关你我  与她无关
Andrew, this is between you and me, not Jessica.

1002
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,920
瞧瞧  现在成安德鲁啦
Wow, look at that. Andrew, huh?

1003
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,670
不是马利克也不是安迪了  是安德鲁
Not Malik or Andy, Andrew.

1004
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,960
听着  她为迈克・罗斯做的事与你无关
Listen to me, what she did for Mike Ross doesn't involve you.

1005
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,250
当然有关  因为她在纽约律师协会面前
Oh, it involves me because she admitted to being a party

1006
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,100
承认了她实行了欺诈
to fraud in front of the New York State Bar.

1007
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,800
好笑的是  好像没人在乎
Funny thing is, no one seemed to care.

1008
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,080
我在乎  所以我提出动议吊销她的执照
Well, I did, so I whipped up a motion to have her disbarred,

1009
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,900
这样的动议如果是
and when a motion like that

1010
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,260
总检察长的办公室提出的
comes from the Attorney General's Office,

1011
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,330
天哪  人要是认真起来真是吓人呢
man, it is amazing how much people start to care.

1012
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,520
-你个混蛋  -终于出现了
- You son of a bitch. - Ah, there it is.

1013
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,710
我就是为你这个表情来的
That's the look I came here to see.

1014
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,410
如果说还有什么能比这个表情更有价值
The only thing better would be if I could be there

1015
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,750
那只能是目睹你
when you have to tell Jessica Pearson

1016
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,170
亲口告诉她你害她被吊销执照了
that you cost her her license to practice law.

1017
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,450
祝你晚上愉快  哈维
Have a nice evening, Harvey.

1018
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,830
路易  接电话
Louis, pick up the phone.

1019
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,900
这是我第三次来电话了
This is the third time I've called.

1020
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,360
我们需要今晚就找到我们认识的所有
We need to get to anyone we know at the New York Bar

1021
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,920
在纽约律师协会的人
on the phone tonight.

1022
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,420
安德鲁・马利克打算吊销杰西卡的执照
Andrew Malik's trying to have Jessica disbarred.

1023
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,490
不是打算  他已经做了
Not trying. He already did.

1024
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,710
-杰西卡  -哈维  放下电话
- Jessica. - Harvey, put that phone away.

1025
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,130
木已成舟  没有什么挽回余地了
This is happening, and there's nothing we can do about it.

1026
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,760
有很大的挽回余地
There's a hell of a lot we can do about it,

1027
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,960
我们也必须挽回
and we're going to.

1028
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,890
不  不行  听我的
No, we're not. Listen to me.

1029
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,410
我们早知道会这样  我说了没关系
We knew this could happen, and I said it doesn't matter

1030
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,300
因为芝加哥不在乎
because in Chicago, nobody's going to care.

1031
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,290
我才不管芝加哥  我在乎
I don't give a shit about Chicago. I care.

1032
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,440
但这不是你的决定
And it's not your decision.

1033
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,050
杰西卡  我们墙上不能有一个
Jessica, we can't have a name on the wall

1034
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,760
被吊销执照的合伙人的名字
of a partner that's been disbarred.

1035
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,470
你以为我是来干什么的
What the hell do you think I'm doing here?

1036
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,220
不  我不干
No, I'm not doing it.

1037
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,480
你必须干
Yes, you are.

1038
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,420
哈维  是时候把我的名字摘下来了
Harvey, it's time to take my name off the wall.

1039
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,720
不能像这样摘
Not like this,

1040
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,460
我们经历了那么多  不能这么结束
not after all we've been through.

1041
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,200
我不在意
I'm good with this,

1042
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,400
这也不是我的律所了
and it's not my firm anymore.

1043
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,290
是你的
It's yours.

1044
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,190
我没准备好
I'm not ready.

1045
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,260
早在今年初你就准备好了
You've been ready for the better part of a year,

1046
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,280
你也很清楚
and you know it,

1047
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,310
所以唯一的问题是
so the only question is,

1048
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,030
你是要跟我纠缠
are you going to fight me on this,

1049
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,360
还是选择接受
or are you gonna accept it?

1050
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,220
如果我选择接受呢
And what if I say I accept it?

1051
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,630
那你就得和路易商量了
Then you need to go and talk to Louis

1052
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,790
因为你有两个问题需要解决
because you've got two things to figure out:

1053
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,340
你打算花多少钱买断我
how much you're gonna spend to buy me out

1054
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,250
还有你打算怎么解释这件事
and how are you gonna spin this thing?

1055
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,780
唐娜  你有时间吗
Donna, you have a minute?

1056
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,380
干什么的时间  路易
A minute for what, Louis?

1057
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,280
为了听你说为什么你
So you can tell me how it wasn't your fault

1058
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,040
没有为我准备出庭不是你的错吗
that you didn't prepare me to be on the stand?

1059
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,500
给我道歉的时间
A minute to say I'm sorry.

1060
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,080
你是对的  唐娜
You were right, Donna.

1061
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,400
我应该为你准备接受马利克盘问
I should have prepared you for Malik,

1062
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,290
但我没有  因为
but I didn't because

1063
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,640
我无法接受当着满屋子人的面  质问你
I couldn't bear the thought of asking you about Harvey

1064
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,120
和哈维的关系
in front of a room full of people.

1065
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,350
路易  我知道你会这么问的
Louis, I knew that would come up.

1066
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,430
我能接受
I was ready to handle it.

1067
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,870
但我不能  因为希拉
But I wasn't, because of Sheila.

1068
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:28,960
跟希拉有什么关系...
What does Sheila have to do with--

1069
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,250
我和她睡了  唐娜
I slept with her, Donna.

1070
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,480
我告诉过你  她要结婚了
I told you she was getting married.

1071
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,130
当我做问题列表时
When I was writing down questions,

1072
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,270
我一直在想象自己的生命被盘问的样子
I kept imagining someone putting my life on trial,

1073
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,220
我实在  无法忍受
and I just--I couldn't take it,

1074
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,660
所以我当了懦夫
so I took the coward's way out,

1075
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,970
我没有为你准备
and I didn't prepare you.

1076
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,820
我理解  路易
I understand, Louis,

1077
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,570
我接受你的道歉
and I accept your apology.

1078
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:55,460
谢谢  唐娜
Thank you, Donna.

1079
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,480
路易  怎么了
Louis, what is it?

1080
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,060
自从我离开那个房间  我就一直裹足不前
Ever since I left that hotel room, I've been stuck.

1081
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,380
我们又在一起了  那感觉和以前一模一样
We were together again, and it felt just like it did before,

1082
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,770
只是这次她不属于我了
except it wasn't because she wasn't mine,

1083
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,680
从那时起  我就一直在数日子
and since then, I've been counting the days

1084
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,150
数我的灵魂伴侣嫁做人妻
until my soul mate marries someone else

1085
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,320
永远离开我的生活的日子
and walks out of my life forever.

1086
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,240
-路易  -我知道她和别人在一起
- Louis-- - I know she's with another man,

1087
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,700
唐娜  我也知道她说她很爱他
Donna, and I know she says that she loves him,

1088
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,920
但我真的很想告诉她
but all I want to do is just say to her,

1089
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:34,190
她难道就看不出来  她的真命天子
can't she see the man she was meant to be with

1090
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,990
其实就站在她面前吗
is standing right in front of her face?

1091
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,430
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

1092
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,290
我应该在我本来有机会时告诉她
I should have told her when I had the chance,

1093
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,360
但那现在成了我这辈子
but that's something I'm gonna have to live with

1094
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,570
必须背负的遗憾了
for the rest of my life.

1095
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,530
正好  你还在  路易呢
Good, you're still here. Where's Louis?

1096
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,920
我有事找他  我觉得你们俩都...
'Cause I have some news, and I think you should both--

1097
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,080
对不起  哈维
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1098
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,830
我必须弄清楚
I just had to know.
