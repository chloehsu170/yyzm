{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,640
迈克・罗斯是个骗子  我保证
Mike ross is a fraud, and I'm gonna make sure

16
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,650
会让他再也看不到法庭是什么样子
he never sees the inside of a courtroom again

17
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,670
除非他穿上那件橙色的囚服上庭受审
unless he's wearing an orange jumpsuit.

18
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,680
那女人无法从起诉
That woman doesn't get anything

19
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,560
你这样一个骗子中得到任何东西
by prosecuting a fraud like you,

20
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,210
但她会很乐意抓住哈维・斯佩克特的
but she would love to get Harvey Specter.

21
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,440
我不会背叛哈维的
I'm not turning on Harvey.

22
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,430
你最好听我的
You gotta listen to me!

23
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,950
因为我抛给了你一条救生索
I'm throwing you a goddamn lifeline!

24
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,080
我也想告诉杰夫有关迈克・罗斯的事情
I want to tell Jeff the truth about Mike Ross.

25
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,390
他告诉你他爱你  是不是
He told you he loved you, didn't he?

26
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,840
我只是不想再对他说谎了
I just don't want to lie to him anymore.

27
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,020
你所说的关于路易把他名字弄上墙的办法
Your whole story about how Louis got his name on the door

28
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,980
都是瞎扯的
is bullshit!

29
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,790
我是来跟你说实话的
And I came here to tell you the truth.

30
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,030
都完了  我们结束了
It's over. We're done.

31
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,540
我从没想过
Never even thought for a second

32
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,940
你甚至会考虑
that you would even consider

33
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,670
背叛哈维那么恶心的想法
an idea so disgusting as turning on Harvey.

34
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,050
唯一能让我考虑它的原因就是
The only reason I thought about it

35
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,530
因为我害怕你会进监狱  怕得要死
is because I am scared to death of you going to prison.

36
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,050
我特地告诉你离迈克的案子远一点
I explicitly told you to stay away from Mike's case.

37
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,910
我不在乎
I don't care.

38
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,840
唐娜  你好像没懂
Donna, I don't think you get it.

39
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,720
总有一天你要在
There is going to come a time where you're gonna

40
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,170
自己和他们之间做出选择
have to choose between yourself and them.

41
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,310
要是他们想冲着我来  随他们来
If they're gonna come for me, they're gonna come for me.

42
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,330
你是说你要回来为我工作
Are you saying you're coming back to me?

43
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,830
是的  我愿意
Yes, I am.

44
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,820
那我们明早办公室见
Then I'll see you back in the office tomorrow.

45
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,800
爸爸  你知道我必须练习
Dad, you know I have to practice.

46
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,310
我知道  亲爱的
I know you do, sweetheart,

47
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,890
但有些事我必须告诉你
But there's something I have to tell you.

48
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,930
什么事
What is it?

49
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,620
我们要搬去康涅迪克州了
We're moving to Connecticut.

50
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,600
什么  为什么
What? Why?

51
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,380
我和你母亲认为这是对你最好的选择
Your mom and I think it's best for you.

52
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,090
如果那对我不是最好的呢
And what if it's not best for me?

53
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,460
宝贝  那是的
Honey, it is.

54
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,640
而且我在哈特福德市外找到了一间很好的公寓
And I found us a great apartment just outside Hartford.

55
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,510
有很多孩子  你肯定会喜欢的
Lot more kids. You're gonna love it.

56
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,730
一间公寓
An apartment.

57
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,880
是的
That's right.

58
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,010
那会比这个又大又老的房子好多了
It's gonna be so much better than this big, creaky--

59
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,530
你肯定有事瞒着我
There's something you're not telling me.

60
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,400
不  没有
No, there isn't.

61
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,730
一定有
Yes, there is.

62
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,610
你怎么知道的
How do you know that?

63
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,090
我也不知道
I don't know,

64
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,540
但我就是知道
But I do.

65
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,690
好吧  唐娜
Oh, okay, Donna.

66
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,320
我的生意  不太顺利
My...business hasn't worked out,

67
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,120
你的叔叔为我找了一份工作
and your uncle offered me a job.

68
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,610
对不起  亲爱的
I'm so sorry, honey.

69
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,300
没事的  爸爸
It's okay, daddy.

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,700
那你继续练习吧
I'll let you practice.

71
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,710
爸爸
Dad?

72
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,050
那里有地方放我的钢琴吗
Will there be a room for my piano?

73
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,350
亲爱的  恐怕没有
Honey, I'm afraid there won't be.

74
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,460
但你的婶婶就在距离几个镇的地方
But your aunt teaches musical theater

75
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,720
教音乐剧
just a few towns away.

76
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,050
我已经给你报名了
I've already signed you up.

77
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,480
谢谢  爸爸
Thanks, daddy.

78
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,820
鲍尔森女士
Ms. Paulsen.

79
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,200
你想喝点什么吗
Could I get you a drink?

80
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,990
我在这里的时间不会够喝什么的
I'm not gonna be here long enough to finish it.

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,060
直到我同意你离开前你都要待在这里
Oh, you're gonna be here till I tell you you can go.

82
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,430
那你肯定要比你预期的更早同意
Which you're gonna tell me sooner than you think,

83
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,060
因为我没什么可说的
because I've don't have anything to say.

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,500
我懂了
I get it.

85
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,710
哈维・斯佩克特做你老板已经很久了
Harvey Specter was your boss for a long time--

86
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,170
也许还有比老板更深的关系
maybe even more than your boss--

87
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,460
因此  你肯定知道
In which case, there's no chance in hell

88
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,630
他在和迈克・罗斯
you didn't know that he was conspiring with Mike Ross

89
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,820
共谋违法
to break the law.

90
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,080
我唯一知道的是
The only thing I know is...

91
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,900
除非你逮捕我
that unless you're gonna arrest me,

92
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,710
不然我现在就要走
I'm walking out that door right now.

93
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,710
好吧
Good.

94
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,100
你跟我想象的一样难搞
You're as tough as I expected you to be,

95
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,570
所以你暂时可以走了
so for now, you are free to go.

96
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,560
我说过我不会久留的
I told you I wouldn't be here long.

97
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,120
你要帮我开门吗
You're gonna get the door for me?

98
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,520
我不是出于礼貌才为你开门的
Oh, I'm not opening the door to be polite.

99
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,480
我只是想看一下
I'm opening the door so I can see the look on your face

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,130
你看到对面房间里的人时的表情
when you see who's in that room across the hall.

101
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,960
爸爸
Dad?

102
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,670
你到底做了什么
What the hell did you do?

103
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,140
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

104
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,930
是你父亲几年前卷入了一桩
Turns out your father got himself involved

105
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,270
见不得人的地产交易中
in a shady real estate deal several years ago.

106
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,240
我父亲一辈子都没有做过什么错事
My father has never done anything wrong in his life.

107
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,390
就像迈克・罗斯和哈维・斯佩克特一样
Just like Mike Ross and Harvey Specter

108
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,080
从没做过什么错事吗
have never done anything wrong?

109
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,960
鲍尔森女士  也许你应该重新评估一下
Ms. Paulsen, maybe you should reassess

110
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,030
你生活中男人的品质了
the quality of the men in your life.

111
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,310
让我进去
Let me in that room.

112
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,890
对不起  不可能
Sorry, not possible.

113
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,020
但下次你见到你父亲的时候
But next time you see your father,

114
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,640
也许你可以向他解释你为了你的老板
maybe you explain to him you put his life on the line

115
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,640
而让他命悬一线
for the man you work for.

116
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,810
我从没想过自己会对另一个女人说这样的话
You know, I never thought that I'd say this to another woman,

117
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,620
但你是一个冷酷无情的婊子
but you are a cold, heartless bitch.

118
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,990
我是  而且我有名片
I am, and I've got a card.

119
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,490
还是把它放在你的包里吧
Why don't I just leave that in your purse?

120
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,410
万一你要是想通了
In case you change your mind

121
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,190
要帮我解决哈维・斯佩克特呢
about helping me out with Harvey Specter.

122
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,650
{\an8}诉讼双雄
第五季  第十二集

123
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,520
{\an8}当日早些时候

124
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,660
你在忙什么
What are you working on?

125
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,440
我只是在想吉布斯下一步会做什么
I'm just trying to figure out what Gibbs is gonna do next,

126
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,390
再想一下对策
figure out how to fight it.

127
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,450
那我能帮你做些什么吗
Is there anything I can do to help?

128
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,130
你可以告诉我你父亲之前
Yeah, you can tell me what your father said

129
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,600
让你如何处理我的事
you should do about me.

130
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,930
那会有什么帮助
How would that help?

131
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,990
因为如果我在担心这件事的话
Because I can't really focus on this

132
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,580
就无法集中精力做别的
while I'm worrying about that.

133
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,450
他让我照照镜子
He told me to look in the mirror.

134
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,010
然后呢
And?

135
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,390
你还希望他作何反应  迈克
How do you expect him to react, Mike?

136
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,620
他很生气  很受伤  而且
He's angry and he's hurt, and--

137
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,780
瑞秋
Rachel.

138
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,470
他让我甩了你
He told me to get rid of you.

139
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,030
好吧
Good.

140
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,500
好什么
Why good?

141
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,300
因为你告诉我无论如何你都会陪着我的
Because you told me that you would stay with me no matter what, 

142
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,630
如果你瞒着我这些事
and when you keep things like that from me,

143
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,510
我就会怀疑
it makes me wonder.

144
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,850
但当你告诉我并且让我看到你的眼神时
But when you tell me and I see that look in your eyes,

145
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,050
就不会了
I don't.

146
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,450
利特先生  我已经安顿好了
Mr. Litt, I'm all settled in.

147
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,590
我只想说
I just wanted to say

148
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,350
我很高兴能跟随你...
that I'm so thrilled to be a part of your te--

149
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,380
是啊  你乐的跟开口蚌似的
Yeah, you're happy as a clam.

150
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,440
我们先说清楚一件事
Let's get one thing straight.

151
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
你或许在哈维那里成功代替了唐娜
You may have filled Donna's shoes with Harvey,

152
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,590
但要想让我满意可没那么容易
but it's not gonna be that easy filling them with me.

153
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,830
你想来硬的就来吧
Well, if that's how you want to play it.

154
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,210
我早就料到了  你的事我都听说了
I already know that. I heard all about you.

155
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,330
是吗  唐娜说的吗
Yeah? From Donna?

156
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,310
诺玛说的
From Norma.

157
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,290
什么
What?

158
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,850
你认识诺玛
You knew Norma?

159
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,080
没错
Damn skippy.

160
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,070
过去三十年  我和她
Played mah-jongg with that woman

161
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,580
每周二晚上都一起打麻将
every Tuesday night for the last 30 years.

162
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,250
81号街菲尔斯坦棋牌社
Mrs. Fillstein's Game on 81st street?

163
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,150
就是那家
The very one.

164
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,720
我一直想去那家棋牌社
I've been trying to get into that game forever.

165
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,470
你知道是她一直不让他们放你进来的吧
You know she kept you out, right?

166
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,900
是诺玛不让我进去的吗
Norma did that to me?

167
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,530
也不能怪她
Well, I can't say as I blame her.

168
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,580
她说那是每周最平静的一晚
Said it was her only peaceful night of the week.

169
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,850
我进来30秒就懂她的意思了
30 seconds in, I can see what she means.

170
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,550
但你还有补救的机会
But you could turn this around.

171
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,560
你对我好点  我能帮你说好话
Play your tiles right with me, I could put in a word for you.

172
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,310
你做什么我都感激不尽
Oh, anything you could do would be so appreciated.

173
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,660
这才像话
Yeah. That's more like it.

174
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,560
我还能更好呢
I can do even better.

175
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,820
你今天就放假回家吧
Please, make yourself at home. Take the day.

176
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,580
那样的话  我们就明早见了
Well, in that case, I'll see you tomorrow morning,

177
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,180
明早见
bright and early.

178
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,860
-你来了  -是啊
- You're here. - I am.

179
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,010
很高兴你回来了  哈维
It's good to have you back, Harvey.

180
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,220
回来我也很高兴  唐娜
Good to be back, Donna.

181
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,230
好了  多愁善感够了
All right, enough sentimentality.

182
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,940
你得...
I need you to--

183
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,160
推掉你接下来两个月的安排  已经搞定了
Clear your schedule for the next two months? Done.

184
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,570
一半活给了支持你的合伙人
I also gave half your business to the partners that backed you

185
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,250
其余的给了杰西卡和路易
and the rest to Jessica and Louis.

186
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,470
我可没让你这么干
I didn't ask you to do that.

187
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,900
是没有  你只让我当回你的秘书
No, you asked me to come back to your desk.

188
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,470
此话不假
I sure as hell did.

189
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,770
接下来呢
What's next?

190
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,390
接下来把迈克叫来
What's next is, get Mike into this office,

191
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,870
可别让他穿的太随意
and I don't want him wearing casual clothes;

192
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,690
让他把超人战袍穿上
I want him with his superman outfit on.

193
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,790
他需要的可不只
He's gonna need a hell of a lot more

194
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,570
斗篷和紧身衣  因为我刚刚收到
than a cape and some tights, because I just got

195
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,050
联邦检察官办公室的快递
a special delivery from the U.S. Attorney's office.

196
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,670
你可别告诉我她申请了查看所有
Don't tell me; she's issued subpoenas

197
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,150
迈克经手过案件的传票
for every case Mike's ever touched.

198
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,880
她申请的是查看我们律所
She issued subpoenas for anything

199
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,770
所有人经手过的案件资料的传票
anyone at this firm has ever touched.

200
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,800
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

201
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,270
意思是他们的目标不只是迈克了
It means they're not just after Mike anymore.

202
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,870
他们正式盯上了我们所有人
They're officially coming after all of us.

203
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,280
迈克已经来了  我去叫他
Mike's already here. I'll get him.

204
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,380
我告诉你  哈维  这招可不是儿戏
I'm telling you, Harvey, this move is no joke.

205
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,820
要是让那个女人进门  她就会找出些什么
That woman gets in the door, she will find something

206
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,970
逼迫某个人说出她想听的话
to pressure someone into saying whatever she wants,

207
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,150
要是我放任她在我的地盘撒野那就见鬼了
and I'll be damned if I'll let her rifle through my house.

208
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,320
你是什么意思
What exactly are you saying?

209
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,810
我的意思是我们需要外部律师
I'm saying we need outside counsel.

210
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,980
绝对不行  我们不能相信任何人
Absolutely not. There's nobody we can trust.

211
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,710
有个人可以信
There is one person we can trust,

212
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,750
因为你已经把迈克的破秘密告诉她了
because you already told her Mike's goddamn secret.

213
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,050
杰西卡  我不会把斯科特牵扯进来的
Jessica, I am not bringing Scottie into this thing.

214
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,450
我能搞定这件事
I'm telling you I can handle this.

215
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,400
你连阻止那些传票的策略都没有
You don't even have a strategy to stop these subpoenas.

216
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,040
好消息是我有办法
Well, then I guess it's a good thing I do.

217
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,980
那你就别等着人夸
Well, then why don't you stop patting yourself on the back

218
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,280
赶紧说吧
and start telling me what the hell it is?

219
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,450
我们主动出击
We go on offense.

220
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,930
那是什么意思
What exactly does that mean?

221
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,320
意思就是我们不需要证明
It means that we don't have to prove

222
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,050
她不能传唤我们的记录
that she can't subpoena our records;

223
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,700
她得证明她能传唤
She has to prove that she can.

224
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,460
而且她毫无证据
And she doesn't have a shred of evidence

225
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,890
证明你知道我的事
proving that you knew about me.

226
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,630
如果她能申请到那些传票
If she got those subpoenas in the first place,

227
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,870
那她肯定有证据
she must have something.

228
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,850
错  我在地检署工作了五年
Wrong, I worked in the D.A.'s office for five years.

229
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,080
法官发传票就像发糖一样随便
Judges give out subpoenas like candy.

230
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,030
那我建议你们俩赶紧去找法官
Then I suggest the two of you get the hell on down there

231
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,850
把那女人的糖抢走
and take that woman's candy away.

232
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,970
法官大人  其实她根本没有
The fact is, Your Honor, she has no grounds

233
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,810
申请这些传票的依据
to even issue these things in the first place.

234
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,880
他来干什么
What is he even doing here?

235
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,940
我来是因为我是个律师
I'm here because I'm a lawyer

236
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,560
在背叛有罪之前  我都是清白的
and I'm innocent until proven guilty.

237
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,380
那些传票根本不是冲我来的
And those subpoenas aren't about coming after me;

238
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,490
而是冲着他去的
They're about coming after him.

239
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,970
一点没错  因为他不可能
You're damn right they are, because there's no way

240
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,700
不知道你是个骗子
he didn't know you're a fraud.

241
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,210
那你证明这些话的证据在哪儿
Where exactly is your evidence of either one of those things?

242
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,910
我懂了  你们不是想撤销那些传票
I see. They're not trying to fight these subpoenas.

243
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,710
而是想让我交出手上的所有证据
They're trying to get me to turn over whatever evidence I have,

244
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,110
而我只需在三周后上交即可
which I don't have to do for another three weeks.

245
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,170
我说什么你就得做什么
You'll do whatever I say you have to do.

246
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,380
现在我想知道这一切的起因是什么
Now, I want to know what started this whole thing.

247
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,660
一位有名望的线人发来一封匿名邮件
We received an anonymous email from a reputable source.

248
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,620
前几天还有个陌生人打电话给我
Yeah, and a stranger called me the other day

249
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,070
说你杀了六个人
saying you killed six people.

250
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,680
我能传唤她的银行记录吗
Can I subpoena her bank records?

251
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,010
你当这是儿戏吗
You think this is a joke?

252
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,310
你知道这不是儿戏就好
You're damn right this isn't a joke.

253
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,520
因为一封没人见过的破邮件
I'm being accused of a crime based on some bullshit email

254
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,730
我就被指控犯罪了
no one's even seen.

255
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,900
我得问你带那封邮件了吗  吉布斯女士
I'd ask if you have that email on you, Ms. Gibbs,

256
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,210
我也不想认为你在骗我
but I wouldn't want to put you in the position of lying to me,

257
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,470
拿出来看看吧
so let's have it.

258
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,460
这封邮件发自哈佛普通员工邮箱
This is from a general Harvard faculty address.

259
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,810
确实  我们正在调查发信者的身份
It is. We are working on tracking down the sender.

260
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,990
你最好找到他们
Well, you'd better find them,

261
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,040
因为没有确切证词
because without corroborating testimony,

262
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,200
我不仅不会准许那些传票
I'll not only quash these subpoenas;

263
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,780
还会叫停整个案子
I'll toss the entire case.

264
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,880
混蛋  是亨利・吉拉德
Son of a bitch. It's Henry Gerard.

265
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,730
哈维  如果吉拉德想暴露我
Harvey, if Gerard was gonna say something,

266
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,010
为什么要等到现在
why would he wait until now?

267
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,900
不知道  但唯一可能出卖你的人
I don't know, but it's the only goddamn person

268
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,790
就是他
it could be.

269
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,000
那我去找他
All right, then I'm gonna go see him.

270
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,070
然后呢
And do what?

271
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,460
我要在吉布斯找到他之前找到他
I'm gonna get to him before Gibbs does,

272
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,480
让他改变想法
get him to recant.

273
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,700
这不是证词
This isn't testimony.

274
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,560
而是对你真实犯下的罪行的举报
It's a tip to a crime you actually committed.

275
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,460
我不管  我们有吉拉德的把柄
I don't care. We have leverage on Gerard.

276
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,680
你还不懂吗
Were you in there?

277
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,800
这个女人对我们俩都紧盯不放
This woman has her sights on both of us.

278
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,650
你前脚去波士顿  她后脚就派人
You go up to Boston, she's gonna have people

279
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,030
把哈佛翻个底朝天
crawling all over Harvard,

280
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,810
那样你就会让她知道吉拉德
and you're gonna be the one who led her to Gerard.

281
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,780
我不能坐以待毙  等待厄运降临
I can't just sit here and wait for the sword to drop.

282
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,830
等一等
Wait a second.

283
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,090
你不能去  我也不能去
You can't go there, I can't go there,

284
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,400
但我知道谁能去
but I know someone who can.

285
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,200
杰西卡
Jessica.

286
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,650
我还在想你何时会来找我
I was wondering when you were gonna show up at my door.

287
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,120
那你听说迈克・罗斯出事了
So you've heard about Mike Ross.

288
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,690
没错  所有人都知道迈克・罗斯的事情
Oh, everybody's heard about Mike Ross.

289
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,700
现在我终于知道你一直对我隐瞒的是什么事
Now I finally know what you were hiding from me the whole time.

290
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,960
但是我不能理解的是
But what I don't know is how the hell

291
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,310
你当初为何要让它发生
you let something like this happen in the first place.

292
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,700
我们过一会再谈这个
We'll talk about that in a minute.

293
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,310
我来不仅是为我们之间的事
But I'm not just here to apologize

294
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,880
向你道歉
for what happened between us.

295
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,700
我是来寻求你的帮助
I'm here to ask for your help.

296
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,750
你是想让我做律所的代理律师
You want me to represent the firm.

297
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,430
如果事情到了那一步  我想请你做我的律师
If it comes to it, I want you to represent me.

298
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,690
你到此向我提出如此要求脸皮可真够厚
You got a lot of nerve coming in here to ask me that.

299
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,050
杰夫  求你了
Jeff, please.

300
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,810
我曾经因为没有信任你而犯错
I made the mistake of not trusting you once.

301
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,880
我不想再犯同样的错误
I don't want to make that same mistake again.

302
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,540
那你必须告诉我一切事情的真相
Then you're gonna have to tell me the truth about everything

303
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,510
立刻  而且你我的谈话 
right now, and it's not gonna be protected

304
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,410
不受律师与当事人保密协议的保护
by attorney-client privilege,

305
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,080
而且你必须相信我不会出卖你
And you're gonna have to trust that I'm not gonna turn you in.

306
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,540
我从未担心过你会出卖我
I was never worried that you were gonna turn me in.

307
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,440
我是担心把你置身于一个难堪的境地
I was worried about putting you in a position

308
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,910
让你不得不为此而撒谎
where you had to lie.

309
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,200
可反正我在那天晚上就准备好要告诉你
But I was ready to tell you that night anyway,

310
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,180
所以现在告诉你也无妨
so I might as well tell you now.

311
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,500
瑞秋  发生什么事了
Rachel, what's going on?

312
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,740
我刚刚接到了一通电话
I just got a call.

313
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,030
他们把唐娜带去联邦检察官办公室了
They took Donna down to the U.S. Attorney's office.

314
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,250
我们必须马上赶过去
We have to get down there right now.

315
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,310
我们不去  我来处理她的事
No, we don't. I'm gonna take care of her.

316
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,180
你继续做我们之前计划好要做的事情
You go ahead and do what we were gonna do together.

317
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,050
哈维  唐娜被带走改变了所有状况
Harvey, Donna getting taken in changes everything.

318
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,880
什么都没有改变  不要再说了
It changes nothing, so stop talking to me

319
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,190
去做你的事情
and do what you have to do.

320
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,340
-是亨利・吉拉德  -什么
- It was Henry Gerard. - What?

321
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,100
检举我的那个人是亨利・吉拉德
The person who handed me in was Henry Gerard.

322
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,320
是一封匿名邮件
It was an anonymous email.

323
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
不可能  他怎么会知道你不是一名律师
No way. How would he even know that you're not a lawyer?

324
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,940
去年我们接手的一个案子  他发现了破绽
That case we took last year, he figured it out.

325
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,770
那为何他要等到现在才举报你
Well, then why would he wait to turn you in now?

326
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,060
我不知道  但我知道的是
I don't know, but what I do know is,

327
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,210
你必须赶往波士顿  让他撤回指控
you need to get up there and you need to get him to take it back.

328
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,290
这我怎么办得到
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

329
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,250
这是你和我必须马上解决的事情
That's what you and I are gonna figure out right now.

330
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,600
等一等  哈维去哪儿了
Wait a second. Where's Harvey?

331
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,830
他去参加了一个重要的会议
He's got an important meeting that--

332
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,770
还有什么事情比这件事情重要
What could be more important than this?

333
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,720
路易  是一件私事
Louis, it's a personal matter--

334
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,880
他在哪儿
Where is he?

335
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,730
他们把唐娜抓去问话了
They brought Donna in for questioning.

336
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,390
该死的  我就害怕发生这种事
Goddamn it, this is what I was afraid of.

337
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,400
我马上赶过去
I'm heading down there right now.

338
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,850
路易  路易  听我说
Louis--Louis, listen to me.

339
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,420
他们会试着对唐娜施压
They're gonna try and put pressure on Donna

340
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,630
让她出卖哈维  
to turn on Harvey, and the best way

341
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,370
消除胁迫的最好办法就是摆平吉拉德
to make that pressure go away is to make Gerard go away,

342
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,470
这样也可以解决掉整件事情
which can make this whole case go away.

343
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,750
把那封该死的邮件给我
Give me the goddamn email.

344
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,990
现在  在去之前  我们必须...
Now, before you go up there, we're gonna--

345
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,460
对不起  等一下
I'm sorry. Wait a second.

346
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,480
为何会有明知你犯罪的人
Why would someone who knows you're guilty

347
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,200
把你说成是"潜在的"骗子
call you a "potential" fraud?

348
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,240
我不知道
I-I don't know.

349
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,540
他可能是想保护他自己
He's trying to cover his ass somehow.

350
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,960
"一个潜在的诈骗犯玷污了
"A potential fraud besmirching the sacrosanct name

351
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,400
哈佛大学圣洁的名声"
of hallowed Harvard University"--

352
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,660
路易  我们真的没有时间了  拜托
Louis, we really don't have time for this. Please.

353
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,090
迈克  我知道是谁写的这封邮件
Mike, I know who wrote this email.

354
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,310
不是亨利・吉拉德
It's not Henry Gerard.

355
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,230
打扰一下  小姐
Excuse me, miss.

356
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,230
一个人吗  我可以和你坐在一起吗
Are you alone, or can an old man pull up a seat?

357
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,250
您好  爸爸
Hi, dad. 

358
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,850
你有没有仔细看这份协议
So have you looked over the deal?

359
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,000
我看过了
I have.

360
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,070
你看出来我对你说过的潜力了吗
And you see the potential I'm talking about?

361
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,480
的确是一个好项目
It's a great project.

362
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,670
但是呢
But? 

363
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,840
我不确定你再回去参与开发
I'm not sure how wise it is

364
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,700
是不是一个明智的决定
for you to get back into development.

365
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,780
我能理解在它对你造成的影响之后
I understand you would feel that way

366
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,970
你会这样想  但是
after what it did to you, but--

367
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,950
我会这样想是因为它对你造成的影响
I feel that way because of what it did to you.

368
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,080
唐娜  我对你说过
Donna, I told you.

369
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,840
现在的银行很痴迷这种事情
the banks are crazy for this kind of thing right now.

370
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,890
我只需要二十五万美金
All I need is $250,000.

371
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,410
我就能申请到五倍数额的贷款
I can get a loan five times the size.

372
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,190
我不知道  听上去真的很冒险
I don't know; that just sounds really risky.

373
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,170
你不是总告诉我  哈维说过
Aren't you always telling me that Harvey says

374
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,050
如果你想出人头地  必须学会冒险
if you want to get ahead, you need to take risks?

375
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,740
这才是你来找我的原因
That's why you came to me.

376
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,940
你不是想要我的钱  而是想要哈维的钱
You're not looking for my money; you're looking for Harvey's.

377
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,660
只是为了确保能得到那笔贷款
It would just be to secure the loan.

378
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,340
银行把钱给我后  就与他没有任何关系
After the bank gives me the money, he's free and clear.

379
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,660
哈维绝对不会同意那样的事
Harvey's never gonna go for that.

380
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,310
我是说  就连我都知道那不合法
I mean, even I know that's not legal.

381
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,270
唐娜  总有人在做这种事
Donna, people do this kind of thing all the time.

382
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,240
这就是一种戏法  仅此而已
It's a sleight of hand, nothing more.

383
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,010
爸爸  你现在干得不错
Dad, you're doing fine.

384
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,110
你真的有必要再冒一次险吗
Do you really need to risk everything again?

385
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,930
唐娜  我经营一家房地产公司
Donna, I manage a real estate office.

386
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,340
那里所有人都赚得比我多  干得都比我好
Everybody there makes more. Everybody there is doing better.

387
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,770
我曾经干得更好
I used to be better.

388
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,140
我知道我能办到
I know I can do this.

389
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,200
求你  你只需要问问哈维
Please, all you have to do is ask Harvey.

390
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,910
如果他拒绝  那就算了
If he says no, he says no.

391
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,580
爸爸  对不起
Dad, I'm so sorry.

392
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,890
别担心  宝贝
Don't worry, sweetie.

393
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,500
我受过很多人很多骚扰
People have tried to rattle my cage plenty of times.

394
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,460
他们以前都没成功过  这次也不会成功
It's never worked before, and it's not gonna work now.

395
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,620
我就这样对她说的  你不会有事
That's what I told her. You're gonna be okay.

396
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,510
唐娜  能让我们单独谈谈吗
Donna, can you give us a minute?

397
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,680
哈维
Harvey...

398
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,360
什么事
Yeah?

399
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,330
他们说这与我在七年前对你提到过的
They're saying this has to do with that deal

400
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,070
那份协议有关
I talked to you about seven years ago.

401
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,710
然后呢
And?

402
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,250
你是不是有什么事没有告诉我
Is there something you're not telling me?

403
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,010
我唯一没有告诉你的事
The only thing I haven't told you

404
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,550
就是我会把他救出来  不惜一切代价
is that I'm gonna get him out of this, no matter what.

405
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,830
你到底干了些什么
What the hell did you do?

406
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,030
你在说些什么
What are you talking about?

407
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,620
你要是七年前没做什么坏事
They didn't bring you in here

408
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,970
他们也不会带你过来
if you didn't do something seven years ago,

409
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,880
如果要我帮你脱身
and if I'm gonna get you out of this,

410
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,240
我得知道你到底做了什么
I need to know what you did.

411
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,030
我做了别人都做的事
I did what everybody else did.

412
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,600
我夸大了抵押品的价值  因为你拒绝了我
I inflated my collateral because you shut me down,

413
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,740
所以别跑过来告诉我这都是我的错
so don't come in here telling me this is my fault.

414
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,420
我之所以拒绝你
I shut you down to protect Donna

415
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,020
就是为了避免唐娜陷入这样的局面
from getting involved in exactly something like this.

416
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,570
这是你的错  不是我的
This is on you, not on me.

417
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,220
你就这么趾高气扬地跑过来
Well, aren't you high and mighty,

418
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,040
指责我将我的女儿置于险境
coming in here accusing me of putting my daughter at risk

419
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,380
而她之所以落到这一步的原因
when the whole reason she's in the position she's in

420
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,590
却是因为你的一些作为
is because of something you did?

421
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,040
没错
That's right.

422
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,510
他们告诉我这些是因为他们
They told me this is because they're trying

423
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,640
试图让唐娜作证指控你
to get Donna to testify against you,

424
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,060
而他们希望我能帮他们劝说她
and they want me to help them get her to do it.

425
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,320
那你怎么不去呢
Then why don't you?

426
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,070
因为我知道这会让她为难死的
Because I know it would kill her,

427
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,380
而且不管你怎么想
and no matter what you may think,

428
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,280
我绝不会做任何伤害我女儿的事情
I would never do anything to hurt my daughter.

429
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,560
你跟唐娜谈过了吗
Did you talk to Donna?

430
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,760
我跟哈维谈过了  他说他会去
I talked to Harvey, and he said it's gonna be f--

431
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,690
我不关心他具体说了什么
I don't care what he says.

432
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,830
他们为什么事抓她的
What are they coming after her for?

433
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,650
迈克  哈维让我不要
Mike, Harvey asked me not to--

434
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,310
瑞秋  他们为什么事抓她的
Rachel, what are they coming after her for?

435
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,550
他们不是抓她
They're not coming after her for anything.

436
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,050
是抓她父亲
They're coming after her father.

437
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,920
什么
What?

438
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,790
据说他曾经涉足一些地产交易
Turns out he was involved in some sort of real estate deal

439
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,980
而有些交易是上不了台面的
and they're saying it wasn't on the up-and-up.

440
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,850
见鬼
Goddamn it!

441
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,850
迈克  冷静点  这没什么
Mike, calm down. It's nothing.

442
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,840
哈维会搞定的
Harvey's gonna get them out of it.

443
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,360
这就是轻微的违规
Look, it's really just a minor violation,

444
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,730
人们甚至不会在乎这个  如果不是因为
and no one would even care if it weren't for--

445
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,160
我  你打算说  如果不是因为我
Me. You were just about to say if it weren't for me.

446
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,010
-迈克  我  -行了
- Mike, I-- - That's it.

447
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,830
我要去认罪
I'm pleading guilty.

448
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,190
我要去接受这个从轻处罚
I'm gonna take the reduced sentence,

449
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,390
我会去服刑  然后这一切
I'm gonna do the time, and all of this

450
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,900
都会消失  永远消失
is gonna go away once and for all.

451
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,670
这不可行  你知道的
That's not an option, and you know it.

452
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,670
他们来追究唐娜父亲的唯一原因是
The only reason they went after Donna's dad

453
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,150
为了你背后的哈维和杰西卡
is to get to Harvey and Jessica.

454
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,750
如果你去认罪  你只会帮了倒忙
If you plead guilty, all you're gonna do is help them do that,

455
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,900
所以你要不然背叛他们俩
so you're either gonna turn on the two of them

456
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,220
要不然你就抗争到底
or you're gonna fight this thing out till the end.

457
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,070
我们得谈一下
We need to talk.

458
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,430
谈什么
About what?

459
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,520
谈谈如果控方拿到传票
About what we're going to do

460
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,670
我们该怎么做
if that prosecutor gets a hold of those subpoenas.

461
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,910
你是说要怎么处理迈克手上那封能证明
You mean what we're gonna do about the letter that Mike has

462
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,930
你知道他是假律师的信件
that proves you knew he was a fraud.

463
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,850
我就是这个意思
Yes, that's what I mean.

464
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,540
我猜想你应该足够聪明
I'm assuming you were smart enough

465
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,360
知道在他们放你出来之后就毁掉那封信
to destroy that thing the second they let you out.

466
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,090
而我认为你应该已经销毁了那封你让瑞秋
And I'm assuming you destroyed the affidavit

467
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,060
签署的证明她对于我的情况知情的宣誓书
that you had Rachel sign saying she knew the truth about me.

468
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,150
我没有销毁
I didn't,

469
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,120
但我跟路易谈过了  我们达成了共识
but I had the same conversation with Louis, we worked it out,

470
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,280
我过来就是要告诉你
and I'm here to tell you

471
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,640
你毁了你手里的文件  我就毁了我的
I will get rid of mine if you get rid of yours.

472
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,960
我知道你在考虑
I knew it; you're actually considering

473
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,790
背叛我和哈维
turning your back on me and Harvey.

474
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,270
我不会背叛任何人
I'm not turning my back on anyone,

475
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,750
但是我们都清楚你做了一些动作
but we both know you've done some things

476
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,180
让我开始怀疑自己是否应该继续信任你
that make me question whether or not I can trust you.

477
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,700
这样的话  你能做的就是
Well, then, the least you can do

478
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,240
在判决下达之前
is find the time to speak with my attorney

479
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,910
找个时间跟我的律师谈一下
before that ruling comes down.

480
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,020
你的律师
Your attorney?

481
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,490
你肯定听说过他
I'm sure you've heard of him.

482
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,630
他的名字是杰夫・马龙
His name's Jeff Malone.

483
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,730
你比我想象得还要下作
You're even lower than I thought you were,

484
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,380
我都没想到你能做出这种事
and I didn't even think that was possible.

485
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,040
像你这样道德水准的人做出这种评价
Coming from someone with your moral compass,

486
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,060
我就当恭维好了
I take that as a compliment.

487
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,920
你有什么权利
What gives you the right

488
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,680
去针对我秘书的父亲
to come after my secretary's father?

489
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,000
我不是起诉他的人
I'm not the one prosecuting him.

490
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,560
事实是我的一个同事
It just so happens that one of my colleagues

491
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,100
由于一件完全不相干的事在起诉他
is going after him on a completely unrelated matter.

492
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,800
放屁  你这么做就是为了
Bullshit, the only reason you're doing this

493
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,120
向唐娜施压  让她来指证我
is to put pressure on Donna to come after me.

494
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,520
既然你提起来了  法官确实说过
Well, now that you mention it, the judge did say

495
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,010
我得找出你跟迈克・罗斯欺诈的联系
I needed something tying you to Mike Ross's fraud

496
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,390
才能得到传票
in order to get those subpoenas,

497
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,370
也许唐娜・鲍尔森就是我要找的联系
and maybe that something is Donna Paulsen.

498
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,140
我得去问问她
I should ask her.

499
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,440
你已经问过她了
You already did ask her,

500
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,690
现在你操纵一个莫须有的案子
and now you're manufacturing

501
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,710
来指控一个无辜的人
a bullshit case against an innocent man,

502
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,560
我保证你会为此付出代价的
and I'm gonna make sure you pay for it.

503
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,520
他陷入这种境地不是因为我做了什么
He's not in here because of what I did.

504
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,590
是因为你做了什么
He's in here because of what you did.

505
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,010
与其指责我  不如好好看看自己
So instead of blaming me, take a look in the mirror,

506
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,860
你该做的就是承认自己犯下的错
'cause all you have to do is admit what you did,

507
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,670
这些都会随之而去
and all of this goes away.

508
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,970
路易
Louis.

509
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,710
你在这里干嘛
What are you doing here?

510
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,100
你知道的
You know why I'm here.

511
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,410
我来这里是为了这个
I'm here because of this.

512
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,770
我不知道那是什么
I don't know what that is.

513
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,700
邮件从头到尾都是你的语气
Please, your language is all over it.

514
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,210
就差签上你的名字了
You might as well have signed your name.

515
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,830
我想知道的是你为什么要这么做
What I want to know is why.

516
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,800
我当时接到一个电话  是一篇报道
I got a call about an article

517
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,010
关于迈克・罗斯如何飞速蹿升到合伙人的
on Mike Ross's meteoric rise to junior partner.

518
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,260
问题是我记得这里毕业的每个学生
Problem is, I remember every student that's ever gone here,

519
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,460
其中没有迈克・罗斯
and there is no Mike Ross,

520
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,770
我又在档案室仔细查了一遍
so I double-checked my file room,

521
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,410
然后我就寄出了这封信
and then I sent this.

522
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,490
希拉  你会毁了我的律所
Sheila, you are messing with my firm.

523
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,290
为什么你不先来问问我
Why didn't you come to me first?

524
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,950
因为我觉得没必要去问你
Because it didn't occur to me that I had to.

525
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,680
一派胡言
That is bullshit!

526
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,650
你匿名报告了这个情况
You reported it anonymously

527
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,820
因为你不想做坏人
because you didn't want to look bad.

528
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,490
你不相信我能保护你不受连累
You didn't trust me to keep you out of it.

529
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,130
我之所以要匿名举报  是因为
No, I reported it anonymously

530
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,610
我为自己任上发生这种事而感到羞愧
Because I was ashamed that it happened on my watch,

531
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,510
但是我不能容忍这种
but I'm not gonna stand by while somebody besmirches

532
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,480
败坏哈佛大学名声的行径
the good name of Harvard University.

533
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,810
你没有证据证明迈克・罗斯败坏了什么
You have no proof that Mike Ross besmirched anything.

534
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,610
你为什么要维护这种败类
Why are you defending this lowlife?

535
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,960
因为如果你先来找我
Because if you'd come to me first,

536
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,820
我本可以从一开始阻止这一切发生
I could have stopped this whole thing from happening.

537
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,620
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

538
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,760
你早就知道
You knew.

539
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,130
希拉  求你了  你不如我了解他
Sheila, please, you don't know him like I know him.

540
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,750
你到底来干什么  路易
What exactly are you doing here, Louis?

541
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,550
我希望你收回你的指控
I want you to retract that email.

542
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,030
告诉他们你弄错了  你找到文件了
Tell 'em that you made a mistake; you found the file.

543
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,900
我做不到
I can't do that.

544
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,360
希拉  求你了
Sheila, please.

545
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,280
我们分手的时候  我强迫自己去接受
When we broke up, I forced myself to accept it,

546
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,970
因为最终我知道我们想要的东西不同
because ultimately I knew we wanted different things,

547
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,950
但我还是伤心欲绝
but it killed me,

548
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,060
因为我知道我们是灵魂伴侣
because I also knew that we were soul mates.

549
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,360
而你现在却让我做这样的事情
But the fact that you're asking me to do this...

550
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,640
我们才不是灵魂伴侣
We are not soul mates.

551
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,910
我求你了
I'm begging you.

552
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,960
至少不要站出来作证
At least don't come forward.

553
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,080
我本来就没打算站出来  路易
I never was gonna come forward, Louis.

554
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,570
离我远点
Now leave me alone.

555
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,930
我就知道你在这里
I thought I'd find you here.

556
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,030
你还好吗
How are you doing?

557
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,740
他们要给我爸爸扣上
Well, they're coming after my father

558
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,850
莫须有的罪名
for something he didn't do.

559
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,970
你觉得我还好吗
How do you think I'm doing?

560
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,110
对不起  你想一个人静一下吗
I'm sorry. Do you want to be alone?

561
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,800
不用  不好意思  我只是
No. I'm sorry. It's just--

562
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,970
唐娜  别这样  你在为
Donna, please, you're worried sick

563
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,380
你爱的人而担忧
for someone you love.

564
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,500
我理解
I get it.

565
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,750
去年我的性命交付在哈维手中的时候
It's just, last year my life was in Harvey's hands,

566
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,000
他说我去担心他输了会怎么样
and he told me that my worrying about what would happen

567
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,410
只会增加他输的可能
if he lost would only make it more likely for him to lose.

568
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,960
我明白  而你又无法不担心
I know, and you can't help but worry about it,

569
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,360
因为那是你爸爸
because it's your father.

570
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,140
对  我没办法
No, I can't.

571
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,250
你也没办法不去想
And you can't help wondering,

572
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,340
真的到了最坏的时候  你会怎么做
if it comes down to it, what will you do?

573
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,050
什么
What?

574
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,810
不  瑞秋  你怎么能问这样的问题
No, Rachel, how can you even ask me that?

575
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,500
我知道了
I get it.

576
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,140
因为到了最坏的时候
Because if it comes down to it,

577
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,940
你想要迈克考虑出卖哈维
you want Mike to consider turning on Harvey.

578
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,190
我不是这么说的
That's not what I said.

579
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,980
如果你来就是想要我
You know, if you're just here to get me

580
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,800
考虑出卖哈维  我现在不需要这个
to think about doing that, I don't need that right now.

581
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,970
不不不  唐娜  我来这里
No, no, no, Donna, I came in here

582
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,890
是因为我关心你  我很
because I care about you and I am--

583
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,500
我很抱歉我提了这件事
I'm sorry that I even brought it up.

584
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,610
你抱歉吗
Are you sorry?

585
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,490
你说什么
Excuse me?

586
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,720
你以为我不知道
Do you think that I don't know

587
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,210
只要我告诉他们这是哈维做的
that all your problems are solved

588
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,720
你就万事大吉了
if I tell them that Harvey did this?

589
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,650
不  唐娜  是迈克说了就万事大吉了
No, Donna, all of my problems are solved if Mike tells them.

590
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,200
但你说得对  如果哈维能敢作敢当
But, yes, my life gets a whole lot better

591
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,110
我的生活会好很多
if Harvey takes responsibility for what he did.

592
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,490
他所做的就是给迈克一个
What he did was give Mike a chance 

593
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,370
出人头地的机会
to make something of himself.

594
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,450
所以迈克绝对不会出卖他的
Which is why Mike's never gonna turn on him.

595
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,040
但是你知道吗
But you know what?

596
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,060
但如果说我没有想过迈克应该做个交易
I would be lying if I said it didn't cross my mind

597
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,260
那是在说谎
that maybe mike should think about making a deal.

598
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,350
你也别告诉我从他们抓走你爸爸开始
And you can't tell me that since they picked up your father

599
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,910
你没有过同样的想法
that the thought hasn't crossed yours too.

600
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,120
想过和说出来
Well, thinking about it and talking about it

601
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,270
可不是一回事
aren't the same thing,

602
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,740
而现在  我要专注于相信哈维
and right now, I'm focusing on having faith in Harvey.

603
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,030
路易  怎么回事
Louis, what the hell?

604
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,110
我找了你一早上了
I've been looking for you all morning.

605
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,450
-发生什么事了  -是她
- What happened? - It was her.

606
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,970
然后呢
And?

607
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,430
她不会收回指控
She's not gonna retract the email.

608
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,290
见鬼  她说什么了
Shit. What did she say?

609
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,230
你以为她说了什么
Oh, what the hell do you think she said?

610
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,730
她说她知道你是个骗子  
Said she knows you're a fraud, 

611
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,170
并且不会撤回指控
she's not gonna take it back,

612
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,230
现在她知道我也参与了这件事
and now that she's figured out that I've been a part of it,

613
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,580
她连看都不想看我了
she can't stand the sight of me.

614
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,140
好吧  那我们得想其他办法
All right, then we need to think of something else--

615
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,940
你听到我刚说的话了吗
Oh, did you just hear what I just said?

616
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,890
她看都不想看到我了
She can't stand the sight of me.

617
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,390
路易  我知道你现在不好受
Louis, I know you're feeling bad,

618
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,190
但现在唐娜处境危险
but right now, Donna is under the gun.

619
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,190
你要我怎么办
What do you want me to do about that?

620
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,220
我不知道  但是如果她不收回邮件里的指控
I don't know, but if she doesn't retract that email

621
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,910
他们找到她的话
and they find her--

622
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,350
不会的  他们不会找到她
No, they're not gonna find her,

623
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,780
因为她是用教师公共邮箱发的
because she sent it from a general faculty email

624
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,670
因为她引以为辱  就像以我为辱一样
because she's ashamed of herself like she's ashamed of me.

625
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,110
而这一切都是你的错  
And this is all your fault, 

626
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,470
所以从我的办公室滚出去
so get the hell out of my office

627
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,070
而不是想方设法
instead of trying to figure out a way 

628
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,450
为你自己遮掩
to cover your goddamn ass!

629
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,690
不管你相不相信  路易
You can believe this or not, Louis, 

630
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,500
但这一刻
but right this second,

631
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,240
我其实是在帮唐娜
I'm actually looking out for Donna.

632
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,530
对不起  迈克
I'm sorry, Mike.

633
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,320
这一刻  我帮不了你
Right this second, I cannot help you.

634
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,790
很好  你来了
Good, you're here.

635
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,380
我要你去处理
Listen, I need you to take care of--

636
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,350
在我们讨论策略之前
Before we get to the game plan,

637
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,770
我需要知道唐娜的爸爸怎么样了
I need to know what's going on with Donna's father.

638
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,760
我在处理了
I'm taking care of it.

639
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,510
你叫路易去见吉拉德了吗
Did you get Louis to go see Gerard?

640
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,350
不是吉拉德  是希拉・赛斯
It wasn't Gerard. It was Sheila Sazs.

641
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,760
开什么玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

642
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,430
路易把你的事告诉他女朋友了
Louis told his girlfriend about you?

643
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,760
不  哈维  是你把我的事告诉女朋友了
No, Harvey, you told your girlfriend about me.

644
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,690
路易冒着生命危险去让希拉
Louis risked his neck to get Sheila

645
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,770
收回指控来为我们遮掩
to take that email back to save our asses.

646
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,340
那你这么失控又是为什么
What are you so bent out of shape for?

647
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,990
我失控是因为他没能做到
I'm bent out of shape because he couldn't do it,

648
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,990
除此之外  唐娜的爸爸是因为我们
And on top of that, Donna's dad is only in this mess

649
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,530
才被牵扯进来  而你却不让我帮忙
because of what we did, and you won't let me help.

650
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,320
说得对  迈克  我不会让你帮忙的
That's right, Mike; I won't let you help,

651
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,660
因为你正在因为诈骗
because you're under investigation

652
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,450
而接受调查
for being a fraud.

653
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,720
他们也在调查你
You're under investigation too, 

654
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,680
我们要假装
and if we're supposed to act like

655
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,760
问心无愧的话
there's nothing to be ashamed of,

656
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,060
那我们就表现得问心无愧
then let's act like there's nothing to be ashamed of.

657
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,750
好了  你说的都对  迈克
Okay, that's all well and good, Mike,

658
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,320
但我才是唐娜爸爸的律师  不是你
but I'm the one representing Donna's father, not you,

659
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,610
也就是说只有我一个人有正当的理由
which means I'm the only one with a credible reason

660
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,360
去见那个最开始
to pay a visit to the banker that gave him

661
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,590
给他那份糟糕贷款的银行家
that shitty loan in the first place.

662
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,940
哈维  这让我生不如死
Harvey, this is killing me!

663
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,780
我必须得做点什么
I have to do something.

664
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,510
现在  你能做的最好的事情
Right now, the best thing you can do

665
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,810
就是想一下如果他们想到了
is think about what we're gonna do

666
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,900
路易的女朋友我们要怎么办
if they put it together about Louis's girlfriend,

667
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,090
因为如果他们找到她  我们就完了
because if they find her, we're in deep shit.

668
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,760
你怎么知道我在这里
How did you find me here?

669
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,030
你的案子里的每一局
I remember every game you have

670
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,610
我都记得
from our work on your case.

671
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,080
我知道我得在一个能让我们
And I knew I had to find you at a place

672
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,410
不被任何哈佛的人看到的地方见面
where we couldn't be bothered by anyone from Harvard.

673
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,770
因为现在哈佛所有人都知道你没有念过哈佛
Because everyone from Harvard now knows you didn't go there.

674
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,220
正因为如此我才需要一个哈佛的人
Which is why I need someone from Harvard

675
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,470
告诉他们我念过
to tell them that I did.

676
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,690
你是疯了吗
Are you crazy?

677
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,910
不  我理智得很
No, I'm smart.

678
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,710
检察官手里只有匿名举报
All they have is an anonymous tip

679
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,910
而没有确凿证据
and no corroborating evidence.

680
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,550
你在这份证明我上过你的课的证词上签字
You sign this affidavit saying that I was in your class,

681
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,890
整个案子都会被撤销了
their whole case gets dismissed.

682
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,950
如果没撤销呢
And what if it doesn't?

683
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,150
那我就出庭受审
Then I go to trial.

684
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,740
这是合理怀疑
This is reasonable doubt.

685
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,460
我无罪释放后  他们就拿我没办法了
I get acquitted, they can never try me again.

686
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,050
或者这不是合理怀疑  你被证实有罪
Or it's not reasonable doubt, you don't get acquitted,

687
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,450
我就得因作伪证入狱了
and I go to jail for perjury.

688
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,280
我还记得当时你作伪证
I remember when you were willing to commit perjury

689
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,510
我们不但阻止了你  还救了你一命
and we didn't just stop you; we saved your ass.

690
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,320
我不管  我不会为你冒这么大风险的
I don't care. I'm not risking everything for you.

691
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,850
这不只是为了我  好吗
This isn't just for me, all right?

692
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,210
他们正在追查每一个我在乎的人
They are coming after everyone that I care about.

693
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,480
我很同情你  迈克
I feel for you, Mike,

694
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,270
因此我绝对不会告发你
which is why I never turned you in in the first place,

695
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,740
但我没法帮你这个忙
but I can't do what you're asking.

696
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,540
那如果我匿名向哈佛举报
And what if I anonymously told Harvard

697
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,720
说你接受过一个想得高分的学生的贿赂呢
that you took a bribe from a student for a grade?

698
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,410
你敢赌上一切确保我不会告发你吗
You willing to bet everything that I won't do that?

699
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,930
你尽管去做吧
You do what you have to do,

700
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,950
我不会把自己的一生都置入险境
But I'm not putting my life in jeopardy

701
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,670
就为了签那个鬼东西
by signing that goddamn thing.

702
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,970
等一下  等等
Wait a minute, wait, wait.

703
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,250
如果我有办法能让你不用作伪证
What if I had a way that you could help me

704
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,630
就能帮到我呢
without having to perjure yourself?

705
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,470
怎么能做到
And how exactly would I do that?

706
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,070
就在你能力范围内
It's right in your wheelhouse.

707
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,530
咱们也来耍些小伎俩
We're playing poker too.

708
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,950
我只是...
I just--

709
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,040
我只需要你帮我虚张声势就行了
I just need you to help me bluff.

710
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,310
哈维  我得请你帮我一个忙
Harvey, I need to ask you to do something.

711
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,090
没问题  唐娜  我会为你做任何事情
Of course, Donna. I'd do anything for you.

712
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,100
其实不是为了我  是为了我爸
Well, it isn't for me. It's for my father.

713
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,900
他想知道你是否有意愿
He wanted to know if you would consider

714
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,980
投资他的房地产项目
investing in his real estate project.

715
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,530
抱歉  我没法帮这个忙
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

716
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,930
可你刚告诉我你会为我做任何事情
You just said that you would do anything for me.

717
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,200
我是说我会去考虑  我考虑好了
I meant I'd consider anything, and I just did.

718
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,630
你看都没看啊
You haven't even looked at it.

719
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,790
没必要看
I don't need to.

720
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,970
你是我的家人  他是你的家人
You're family to me, he's family to you,

721
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,010
而钱是不能投资给家人的
and you don't invest money with family.

722
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,740
马库斯因为餐厅的事需要钱时 
That's not what you said when Marcus needed money 

723
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,490
你可不是这么说的
for his restaurant.

724
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,200
-那不一样  -为什么
- That's different. - Why?

725
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,510
因为马库斯很清楚自己在干什么
Because Marcus actually knew what the hell he was doing.

726
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,990
哈维  你要是不想投资就算了
You know what, Harvey? If you don't want to invest, don't invest,

727
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,890
但我不需要你来告诉我
but I don't need a lecture from you

728
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,510
我爸有多不擅长经商
on what a bad businessman my father is.

729
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,220
你需要
Yes, you do.

730
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,450
是吗  为什么
Oh, really? Why's that?

731
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,790
因为我没猜错的话
Because if I know you,

732
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,030
你正在考虑把你退休金给他
you're thinking of giving him access to your 401K.

733
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,170
所以呢  是又怎样
So? What if I am?

734
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,080
唐娜  这个人曾经把你家的钱给亏光了
Donna, this man lost your family's money once.

735
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,710
你要给他多一次机会这么做吗
You're gonna give him the chance to do it again?

736
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,870
哈维  他是我爸爸
Harvey, this man is my father,

737
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,020
他一直都支持着我
And he has been there for me my whole life.

738
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,230
我知道你和你妈的事情
And I know what happened between you and your mother,

739
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,130
但别因为她做的事就随便判定他
but don't you judge him for what she did.

740
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,700
你怎么可以这样说  这和那事无关
How dare you? This has nothing to do with that.

741
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,520
你看他的事情是有盲点的
You have a blind spot when it comes to him.

742
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,540
我这是在保护你
I'm trying to protect you.

743
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,500
你不是在保护我  你这样做像个混蛋
Well, you're not. You're being an asshole.

744
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,110
提醒你一下  让我远离我爸
And for your information, keeping me from being there

745
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,940
才不是在保护我
for my father isn't protecting me.

746
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,750
而是在激怒我
It's pissing me the hell off.

747
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,670
太好了  唐娜你在  我需要你去...
Good, Donna, you're here. Look, I need you to--

748
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,040
我只想听你说你干了什么
The only thing I need is for you to tell me what you did,

749
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,890
因为我刚发现他们
because I just found out that they're

750
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,140
明天将正式以银行欺诈的罪名起诉我爸
formally charging my father with bank fraud tomorrow.

751
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,750
该死
Goddamn it.

752
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,400
你做了什么
What did you do?

753
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,460
我只是去逼了一个银行家
All I did was strong-arm a banker.

754
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,640
你为什么要去逼一个银行家
And why the hell would you need to strong-arm a banker?

755
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,890
因为他手上有必须除掉的证据
Because he had evidence that needed to get lost.

756
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,870
我就知道你有事没告诉我
I knew there was something you weren't telling me.

757
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,870
七年前到底发生了什么
What the hell happened seven years ago?

758
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,170
发生的只是  你来找我
What happened is, you came to me

759
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,610
让我帮你爸一个忙  于是我去找他
asking a favor for your father, so I went to him

760
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,110
让他帮我一个忙
asking a favor of my own.

761
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,080
胡说  你是不会让人帮忙的
Bullshit. You don't ask people for favors.

762
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,620
你只会逼他们做事
You force them to do things!

763
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,930
你说得太对了
You're goddamn right I do.

764
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,880
我告诉你爸如果他拿了你的钱
I told your father if he took your money,

765
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,680
我就会用尽一切手段让他的生意完蛋
I'd pull every string I have to shut his deal down.

766
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,460
你没权力这样做
You had no right to do that.

767
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,010
我不管我有没有权力这么做
I don't care if I had a right to do it or not.

768
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,510
我是不会任凭你失去一切
I wasn't gonna let you lose everything

769
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,300
只因为你没有看透他
just because you couldn't see the truth about him.

770
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,230
我看透的是  你没经允许掺和我的私事
The truth is, you went behind my back,

771
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,700
他又做了些违法的事情
and then he did something illegal,

772
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,940
弄得我现在要因为你们的所作所为
and now I have to choose between you and him

773
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,380
在你们之间做选择
because of what you did!

774
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,600
我做的只有
What I did was keep you

775
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,000
让你不趟这趟浑水
from being involved in this mess.

776
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,860
不  哈维  那天你一意孤行
No, Harvey, what you did was start this mess

777
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,420
雇了个骗子进来  制造了这趟浑水
the day you went ahead and hired a fraud.

778
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,660
怎么了
What happened?

779
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,310
他们要正式起诉唐娜的父亲了
They're formally charging Donna's father,

780
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,810
我们得找法子让他的案子撤回
and we need to figure out a way to get his case thrown out.

781
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,770
那样我们得让我的案子撤回
Well, then we have to get my case thrown out,

782
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,070
因为这会让他们顾不得唐娜的爸爸
Because then they won't care about Donna's dad.

783
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,490
那该怎么做呢
And how the hell are we gonna do that?

784
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,710
我去见吉拉德了
I went to see Gerard.

785
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,340
该死  我不是让你别这么做吗
God damn it, didn't I tell you not to do that?

786
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,000
那是因为之前我们不知道
That was before we knew he wasn't the one

787
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,360
他没告发我
that tipped them off.

788
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,120
那如果他没有告发你
If he wasn't the one who tipped them off,

789
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,300
那你找他干什么
what the hell did you go to him for?

790
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,250
我找他是为了这个
I went to him for this.

791
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,500
这是一份用词很模糊的声明
This is a vaguely worded statement.

792
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,770
并不能很好地说明你上过哈佛
It doesn't even specifically say you went to Harvard.

793
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,160
没必要说明
It doesn't have to.

794
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,950
这上面声称因为我掌握了他教的知识
It says that he's known me to be an amazing lawyer,

795
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,420
他知道我会是名杰出的律师
that I've shown mastery of the material that he teaches,

796
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,630
而就他所知而言
and that as far as he's concerned,

797
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,300
我是一名杰出的法律系学生
I'm an outstanding student of the law.

798
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,280
简直是狗屁
It's total bullshit.

799
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,940
这可不是狗屁  好吗
It's not total bullshit, all right?

800
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,400
如果他们没找到希拉  我们又有这个
If they don't find Sheila and we do this,

801
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,730
整个案子就会被驳回
we could get the whole case thrown out.

802
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,490
吉布斯会看穿这把戏的
Gibbs'll see right through this.

803
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,490
她会让吉拉德出庭作证  
She'll put Gerard on the stand, 

804
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,650
直截了当地问他
and she'll ask him point blank

805
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,230
他是否知道你没上过哈佛
if he knows for a fact that you never went to Harvard,

806
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,570
这样就等于我们判了自己死刑
and we'll have signed our own death warrant.

807
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,180
她不会的  因为这违反了
She's not gonna do that, because it violates

808
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,800
你教我的律师守则第一条
the number one rule of being a lawyer that you taught me:

809
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
不要问你不知道答案的问题
Don't ask a question that you don't have the answer to.

810
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,730
风险太大了
It's too big a risk.

811
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,510
哈维  唐娜的父亲处境危险
Harvey, Donna's dad is at risk,

812
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,200
而事情是因我而起
and he's at risk because of me.

813
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,270
唯一能让他脱身的办法就是我去告发你
The only way to get him out is to have me to turn on you

814
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,880
或者让整件事消失
or for us to get this whole thing thrown out,

815
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,840
所以你到底同不同意
so are you on board with this or not?

816
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,560
我们最好祈祷这招有用
We better pray this bullshit works,

817
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,310
不然的话  明天我们俩至少有一个
because, if it doesn't, at least one of us

818
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,300
要蹲监狱去了
is gonna end up in prison tomorrow.

819
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,440
我们要干什么
All right, what are we doing here?

820
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,870
法官大人  我们提出动议
Your Honor, we have a motion 

821
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,520
撤销迈克・罗斯的案子
to dismiss Mike Ross's case.

822
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,320
以什么理由
On what grounds?

823
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,180
理由是我这里有一封来自
On the grounds that I have a letter here

824
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,280
哈佛法学院亨利・吉拉德教授的信
from Professor Henry Gerard of Harvard Law

825
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,310
称迈克・罗斯当时在他的班级中
saying that Mike Ross was in his class.

826
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,530
真是可笑
This is ridiculous.

827
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,210
就算罗斯先生在他的班级中
Even if Mr. Ross were in that class,

828
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,040
也不能证明他就是哈佛的注册学生
it doesn't mean he was matriculated.

829
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,480
但你也没有任何证据表明他不是
You still haven't shown any evidence that he wasn't,

830
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,400
所以有了这份文件  这个案子应该被撤销
which is why that document should get this case dismissed.

831
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,920
这份文件不过是
This document is

832
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,430
一张措辞模糊的废纸罢了
a cryptically worded piece of shit,

833
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,630
而且你又是个名声在外
and you're a man who has a reputation

834
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,760
不择手段的人
for crossing the line.

835
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,680
吉布斯女士  注意言辞  你想说什么
Ms. Gibbs, language. What are you implying?

836
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,330
法官大人  这很有可能
Your Honor, there's a good chance

837
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,990
是他逼吉拉德教授签的
he coerced this Professor Gerard into signing this thing.

838
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,330
所以我们的证物都是敲诈勒索来的
So our exhibits are all from blackmail,

839
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,750
只有你的证据是干净的  你是特雷莎修女啊
but yours are squeaky clean because you're Mother Teresa?

840
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,020
我或许不是特雷莎修女
I may not be Mother Teresa,

841
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,980
但我的证据肯定不是严刑逼供来的
but I don't resort to coercion to get my evidence.

842
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,130
那你对唐娜・鲍尔森父亲的所作所为
Then what exactly are you doing

843
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,640
要怎么解释
with Donna Paulsen's father?

844
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,010
介意告诉我他在说什么吗
Care to tell me what he's talking about?

845
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,910
我来告诉您  她针对一个无辜的商人
I'll tell you. She fabricated a charge

846
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,420
进行虚假指控  以此来给我的秘书施压
against an innocent businessman to pressure my secretary

847
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,460
好让她做假证指认我
into giving false testimony against me.

848
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,180
法官大人  找到能对付重要证人的筹码
Your Honor, it's standard practice

849
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,430
并不出格
to find leverage against a vital witness.

850
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,820
那让联邦法警在小隔间里
Oh, is it also standard practice to have

851
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,310
殴打我  也不出格吗
a federal marshal rough me up in a holding cell?

852
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,800
吉布斯女士  如果我发现有滥用职权
Ms. Gibbs, if I find out there's an abuse of power here,

853
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,810
那你就将是我的重点关注对象了
I will be switching my focus to you.

854
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,070
在您对他们的请求做出裁决之前
Then before you rule on their motion,

855
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,210
州检有权
the state has the right

856
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,940
对吉拉德教授进行提问
to question this Professor Gerard.

857
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,760
法官大人  我可以和吉布斯女士单独聊聊吗
Your Honor, can Ms. Gibbs and I have a minute alone?

858
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,590
请
Please.

859
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,170
你以为我不知道这封信就是在胡扯吗
You think I don't know this letter is complete bullshit?

860
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,460
我把这个跳梁小丑拉到庭上来
I pull this clown up on the stand,

861
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,110
他马上就会说实话
he's gonna tell me the truth in a minute.

862
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,610
这个小丑可是国内最有名的
Okay, this clown is one of

863
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,450
职业道德教授之一
the most distinguished ethics professors in the country.

864
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,350
你把他拉到庭上  这个案子会在
You put him up there, this case is over for you

865
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,680
你开始之前就结束
before you even get started.

866
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,220
那怎么现在不见他来
Then why the hell isn't he here right now

867
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,260
证明这事呢
verifying this thing?

868
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,470
因为比起他自己
Because that kid cares more about Donna Paulsen

869
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,990
这小子更在乎唐娜・鲍尔森
than he does about himself.

870
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,010
你想怎样
What do you want?

871
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,100
我想做个交易  这封信换唐娜的父亲
I want to make a deal-- that letter for Donna's father.

872
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,980
这也太便宜你了
This is too good for you.

873
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,500
如果你真的有吉拉德这张牌  他早就来了
If you really had Gerard, he'd be down here right now.

874
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,180
如果真是我说了算的话  他早就到了
If it were up to me, he'd be down here right now,

875
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,640
但这是迈克的决定
but this is Mike's call.

876
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,550
机不可失  时间不等人
This is a one-time offer, and the clock's ticking.

877
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,090
你还是要上庭审
You still get to go to trial,

878
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,140
让唐娜和他父亲置身事外
we get Donna and her father off limits,

879
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,070
我们俩择日再战
and we both live to fight another day.

880
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,890
我还要重发传票
I want my subpoenas too.

881
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,760
没门儿  法官说了不行
No way. Judge said no.

882
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,630
你要是把这件事在庭审上再说出来
You try to pull this thing out at trial,

883
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,640
我就把你那位教授朋友撕个稀巴烂
I will rip your professor friend to shreds.

884
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,240
法官大人  我和吉布斯女士已达成协议
Your honor, Ms. Gibbs and I have come to an agreement.

885
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,980
她放弃对詹姆斯・鲍尔森的所有指控
She's dropping all charges against James Paulsen,

886
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,230
我们撤回驳回此案的动议
and we withdraw our motion to dismiss.

887
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,290
下周见
See you next week.

888
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,060
俱乐部不错啊
Nice club.

889
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,370
新来的吗
Are you new?

890
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,440
随便看看  不爱打高尔夫
Just visiting. Not much of a golfer.

891
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,210
真不幸  我也是
Unfortunately, neither am I.

892
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,670
哈维・斯佩克特
Harvey Specter.

893
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,100
吉姆・鲍尔森
Jim Paulsen.

894
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,870
我猜这是关于唐娜
I assume this is about the opportunity

895
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,840
给你带去的那个机会
Donna brought you.

896
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,770
如果数字合理的话才是个机会  吉姆
It'd be an opportunity if the numbers added up, jim,

897
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,950
但并不合理
but they don't.

898
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,450
我不懂
I don't understand.

899
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,030
我以为你是那种
I thought you were the type of man

900
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,780
-愿意冒风险的人  -我是
- that was willing to take risks. - I am--

901
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,700
但若会置我在乎的人于险境  那就另当别论了
but not if it puts people I care about in jeopardy,

902
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,150
所以我来是想告诉你
which is why I'm here to tell you

903
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,420
如果唐娜要把她的养老金给你
that when Donna offers you her 401k,

904
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,020
请你拒绝
you're gonna tell her you don't need it anymore.

905
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,740
无意冒犯  斯佩克特先生  但我女儿
No offense, Mr. Specter, but what my daughter does

906
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,570
怎么处理她的钱  与你无关
with her money is none of your business.

907
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,780
当唐娜对你太崇拜以至于
Well, it became my business when Donna put you

908
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,070
她不能分辨你那满嘴胡话的时候
so far up on a pedestal that she couldn't smell

909
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,630
我就必须要管了
the bullshit you were dishing out.

910
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,130
我没有在胡说
It's not bullshit.

911
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,640
你有  我看过那个交易了
Yes, it is. I looked at that deal.

912
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,420
你不可能一点手脚都不动
There's no way you're getting the kind of money you need

913
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,070
就拿到那么大一笔钱
without doing something shady.

914
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,010
夸大点我的资产获得贷款算不上动手脚
Inflating my assets to get a loan isn't shady.

915
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,050
大家都这么干
Everybody does it.

916
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,780
大家完蛋前都是这么想的
That's what everybody thinks until the music stops,

917
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,210
所以如果你让唐娜牵涉其中
which is why if you involve Donna in this deal,

918
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,380
我发誓  我会用尽手段
so help me god, I will pull every string I have

919
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,320
让你的项目在法庭上绑二十年
to tie your project up in court for the next 20 years.

920
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,250
我只是在努力打拼罢了
I'm just trying to make my way.

921
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,960
我想说的只是  别连累唐娜就行
All I'm telling you is, you can make it without Donna.

922
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,770
你好像觉得我连自己女儿都不爱一样
You act as if you think I don't love my own daughter.

923
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,520
如果爱一个人的话
People who love other people

924
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,350
是不会置他们于违法之地的
don't put them in positions to break the law.

925
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,890
刚跟我爸打完电话
I just got off the phone with my dad.

926
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,580
他把好消息告诉了我
He told me the good news.

927
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,280
跟你说了  我会搞定的
I told you I'd take care of it.

928
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,680
你怎么做的
What did you do?

929
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,980
那不重要
It's not important.

930
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,930
哈维
Harvey.

931
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,730
我们撤回了撤销迈克案子的动议
We withdrew our motion to dismiss Mike's case

932
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,240
以此为交换让她放过你
in exchange for her leaving you alone.

933
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,500
所以我拖了迈克案子的后腿
So I hurt mike's case.

934
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,790
不  你没有
No, you didn't.

935
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,460
整件事都是在虚张声势罢了
The whole thing was based on a bluff

936
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,810
本来也站不住脚的
that never would have held up anyway.

937
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,130
这样  至少我们还赚了一点
This way, we at least got something for it.

938
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,620
谢谢你  哈维
Thank you, Harvey.

939
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,190
我很抱歉说了那些话
And I'm sorry for what I said.

940
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,820
不
No.

941
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,660
你说的是对的
You were right to say it.

942
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,250
我不该把你置于这种境地  唐娜
I never should have put you in this position, Donna.

943
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,750
如果你想回去为路易工作  我能理解
If you want to go back to work for Louis, I'll understand.

944
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,630
你是不该把我置于这种境地
No, you shouldn't have put me in that position,

945
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,470
但如果我要为你雇了迈克而离开你
But if I was gonna leave you for hiring Mike,

946
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,640
那我几年前就这么做了
the time to do that would have been years ago.

947
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,100
希望我没有打扰你们过早庆贺
I hope I'm not interrupting your premature celebration.

948
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,090
你最好不要在协议上食言
You better not be reneging on our deal.

949
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,390
不  我会遵守
Oh, no, I'm gonna honor it.

950
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,720
我只是顺路过来给你这个
I just dropped by to serve you with these.

951
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,510
你和你的合伙人被传讯
You and your partners are hereby subpoenaed

952
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,000
提供律所所有文件
to hand over every single document in the entire firm.

953
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,450
不
No.

954
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,810
法官不可能批准这个
No way the judge granted that

955
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,540
就为我们撤回驳回此案的动议
just because we withdrew our motion to dismiss.

956
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,650
她没有
She didn't.

957
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,760
她是在哈佛一个叫希拉・赛斯的
She granted it when a Sheila Sazs from Harvard

958
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,180
出现说是她写了匿名邮件之后批准的
came forward and said she wrote that anonymous email.

959
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,190
没错  斯佩克特先生
That's right, Mr. Specter.

960
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,790
你们赢下这案子的形势
Your chances of winning this case just took

961
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,950
急转直下了
a mighty big turn for the worse.

962
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,320
你来这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

963
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,350
你没来见我
You never came to see me,

964
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,110
所以我觉得我该来找找你
So I thought I would come to you

965
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,280
弄清楚你为什么这么愿意
and find out why you're so willing

966
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,820
让那些危险的信件
to let all those dangerous letters

967
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,790
一直在外面到处传
just keep floating around out there.

968
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,270
我想你是指那些会危及你客户的信件
I think you mean letters that are dangerous to your client.

969
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,420
我现在手里就有一封
Well, I'm holding one right here

970
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,340
会给你的女人招来麻烦  迈克
that puts your woman in a world of trouble, Mike,

971
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,750
所以  我不是那意思
So no, no, I don't.

972
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,850
我明白了
Oh, I get it.

973
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,100
我没有服从杰西卡  所以你来
I didn't crumble to Jessica, so now you're here

974
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,640
强迫我接受交易
to take a shot at strong-arming me into a trade.

975
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,490
不  我来是来看看
No, see, I came to see why,

976
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,250
为什么保护了你这么久的女人
when the woman that's been protecting you for so long

977
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,270
只要求你给一点信任
asks you for a simple gesture of trust,

978
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,280
你却好像认为
you seem to think that 

979
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,630
她只是在保护自己
all she's doing is protecting herself.

980
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,190
因为她是在保护她自己
Because she is protecting herself.

981
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,950
你说得没错  她是在保护自己
You're goddamn right that's what she's doing,

982
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,510
但也不只是保护自己
but that's not all she's doing,

983
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,510
因为从她发现你的事的那一刻起
because from the second that she found out about you,

984
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,130
她就一直在为你说谎
she's had to lie for you,

985
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,610
而她一直待你如家人
and she still treated you like family,

986
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,210
那让她搭上了一切
and it cost her everything.

987
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,850
饶了我吧  到目前为止她什么也没失去
Give me a break. Until now, it didn't cost her anything.

988
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,320
你给我小心点
You better watch yourself.

989
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:19,970
你在做什么
What the hell are you doing?

990
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,280
那让她失去了跟我的感情
It cost her her relationship with me!

991
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,150
你不知道  是吗
You didn't know about that, did you?

992
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,500
现在你知道了
Well, now you do.

993
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,530
所以如果我给你  你会毁掉吗
So you'll destroy that if I give you mine?

994
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,770
我是个律师  不能毁掉证据
I'm an attorney. I can't destroy evidence.

995
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,380
但你  你想做什么都行
But you? You can do whatever you want.

996
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,810
你这么信任我吗
You trust me to do that?

997
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,600
不  迈克
No, Mike.

998
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,790
杰西卡信任你
Jessica does.

999
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,690
路易  我需要你坐下来
Louis, I need you to sit down.

1000
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,470
怎么了  发生了什么
What is it? What happened?

1001
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,010
你父亲还好吗  我现在过去
Is your father okay? I'll go down there right now.

1002
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,410
他很好  哈维搞定了
He's fine. Harvey took care of it.

1003
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,980
那我不需要坐下来了
Oh, well, then I don't need to sit down.

1004
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,550
因为不管什么事  你没事我就没事
'Cause whatever it is, if you're okay, I'll be okay.

1005
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,920
希拉站出来了
Sheila came forward.

1006
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,350
什么
What?

1007
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,420
她承认是她写的邮件
She admitted she was the one to write the email.

1008
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,740
不可能
That's not possible.

1009
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,060
她跟我保证了不会做的
She promised me she wouldn't do that.

1010
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,290
很抱歉  路易  但她做了
I'm sorry, Louis, but she did.

1011
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,160
我得一个人静静
I need to be alone.

1012
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,380
路易  我觉得现在你不该...
Louis, I don't think this is the time for you to--

1013
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,880
我说了  出去
I said get out.

1014
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,930
他做了吗
He did it?

1015
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:05,980
做了
He did.

1016
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,360
你跟他说了什么
What did you say to him?

1017
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,360
我告诉了他这件事让你损失了什么
I told him how much it cost you,

1018
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,080
而后我做了我们讨论过的事
and then I did what we talked about.

1019
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,520
那很好
Well, it's a good thing you did,

1020
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,380
因为这些传票刚刚送来
because those subpoenas just came down.

1021
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,070
杰西卡  我知道我一直
Jessica, I don't know that I've ever been

1022
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,740
都不太相信神灵
much of a spiritual person,

1023
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,920
但我的确承认
but I would be lying if I didn't admit

1024
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,140
有时我会觉得上帝自有安排
that sometimes I think god has a plan.

1025
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,660
你在说什么
What are you saying?

1026
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,500
我说上帝可能是想告诉你
I'm saying that maybe he's trying to show you

1027
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,900
在皮尔森-斯佩克特-利特律所外
that there's more to life than 

1028
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,500
生活还有很多部分
Pearson Specter Litt.

1029
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,550
这件案子  我不会做你的律师
I'm not gonna be your attorney on this one.

1030
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,630
我觉得你可以找到更好的
I think you can find someone better.

1031
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,430
不
No.

1032
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,470
我相信你  而且也不可能
I trust you, and there's no way

1033
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,990
找到我更相信的人
I find someone that I trust more.

1034
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,960
那就在这事结束之后来找我
Then find me when this is all over,

1035
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,530
看看能不能把那份信任派上更好的用场
and we'll see if we can put that trust to better use.

1036
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,770
格雷琴  无论什么都可以等明天
Gretchen, whatever it is, it can wait till tomorrow.

1037
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,190
这个不能等
This can't wait.

1038
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,360
我想向你道歉
I want to apologize to you.

1039
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,860
为什么
For what?

1040
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,620
杰克・索罗夫提名迈克・罗斯做合伙人时
When Jack Soloff nominated Mike Ross for partner,

1041
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,860
我知道那让哈维有点受伤
I know it hurt Harvey a little,

1042
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,790
因为他希望是他提名迈克
because he wanted to be the one to do it,

1043
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,720
所以我给《美国律师协会杂志》打电话
so I called the "ABA Journal" 

1044
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,750
要求报道迈克
to write an article about Mike.

1045
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,490
我是想给哈维一个惊喜
I wanted to surprise Harvey with it.

1046
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:35,000
你是说那篇让希拉看出问题的文章是你弄的
You're saying the article that tipped Sheila off was you?

1047
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,210
是的
Yes.

1048
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,450
你为什么要告诉我
Why are you telling me this?

1049
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,630
因为我很抱歉
Because I'm sorry.

1050
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:47,240
如果有人问  我会否认说过这些
And if anyone ever asks, I'll deny ever saying this,

1051
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,850
但  我知道你们都知道
but...I know you all knew.

1052
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,900
我支持你们
And I'm with you.

1053
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,110
出什么事了
What's the matter?

1054
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:09,080
我知道我说过不希望你隐瞒我任何事
I know I said I don't want you to keep things from me,

1055
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,210
而我也不想隐瞒你
but I don't want to keep things from you either.

1056
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,350
你隐瞒了什么
What are you keeping from me?

1057
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,980
其实有一个好消息和一个坏消息
It's actually good and bad news.

1058
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,490
我今天有机会把这个事完全搞定
We had a chance to get this whole case thrown out today,

1059
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,300
但最后没成功  但我们把唐娜的事搞定了
and it didn't work, but we did get Donna off,

1060
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,650
而且这是第一次  我真的开始相信
and for the first time, I actually started to believe

1061
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,250
我们可以解决这件事
we can get out of this thing.

1062
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,200
那你之前为什么不敢跟我承认呢
And why were you afraid to admit that to me?

1063
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,960
因为我不想让你燃起希望
Because I didn't want to get your hopes up.

1064
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,320
而我之前真的没信心
And I didn't really believe it before.

1065
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,290
怎么了
Yeah, what's up?

1066
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,230
希拉・赛斯站出来了
Sheila Sazs came forward,

1067
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,580
意味着他们要更强硬地迫使我们
which means they're gonna try and pit us all

1068
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,180
所有人互相指认了
against each other even more.
