{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

70
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,900
你把我坑苦了
You hung me out to dry.

71
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,540
此话怎讲
How exactly did I do that?

72
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,910
你弄的像是我夺走了
By making it seem like I'm the one

73
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,510
你的梦幻婚礼一样
that's taking away your dream wedding.

74
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,670
本来就是你夺走了我的梦幻婚礼
You are the one taking away my dream wedding!

75
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,820
我们要结婚了
We're getting married,

76
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,660
婚礼就小办一场
and it can be as small as possible

77
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,360
只请我们的亲朋好友  好吗
with just our close friends, okay?

78
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,050
我觉得我们应该提拔
I think we should consider promoting Jack Soloff

79
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,810
-杰克・索罗夫做冠名合伙人  -你疯了吗
- to name partner. - Are you crazy?

80
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,790
哈德曼手上有他的把柄
Hardman's got something on him.

81
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,530
如果哈德曼有他的把柄
If Hardman has something on him,

82
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,330
那我们也要抓到他的把柄
then we need to have it on him, too.

83
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,120
你想让我走  召集投票去
You want me gone, call for a vote,

84
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,490
因为我们知道丹尼尔的投资人是怎么回事
'cause we know what's going on with daniel's investor,

85
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,860
而哈维正在去解决问题
and Harvey's about to put a stop to it right now.

86
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,610
我为什么要相信你真的会
Why should I believe you would even live up to

87
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,590
实现你的承诺呢
your end of the bargain?

88
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,290
因为我根本不在乎
Because I don't give a shit

89
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,220
你跟丹尼尔・哈德曼的斗争
about your war with Daniel Hardman.

90
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,280
我想要的只是看着你跪下
All I want to do is see you get down on your knees

91
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,200
然后说  "我退出"
and say, "I quit."

92
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,560
你每天都在违法
You're breaking the law every day.

93
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,920
所以我不该结婚了
Oh, so now I shouldn't get married?

94
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,900
我是说你应该辞职
I'm saying you should quit.

95
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,460
人生走得越远
The longer you go,

96
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,710
钱就越不重要
the less the money matters.

97
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,190
你差点被抓  是吗
You almost got caught, didn't you?

98
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,630
我去找了个人聊了聊
I went to talk to someone.

99
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,400
是谁
Who?

100
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,040
你知道是谁
You know who.

101
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,880
妈妈  爸爸
Mom? Dad!

102
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,510
奶奶  你怎么在这里
Grammy, what are you doing here?

103
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,770
妈妈呢  我想抱抱她
Where's mom? I want to give her a hug.

104
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,620
还有爸爸
Dad, too.

105
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,180
什么
What?

106
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,920
昨晚你让我不要生他们的气  记得吗
You told me not to be mad at them last night, remember?

107
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,890
你说等他们回来我应该跟他们说对不起
You said once they got home I should tell them I was sorry

108
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,010
并给他们个拥抱
and give them a hug.

109
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,460
但他们没叫我起床  所以我没机会
But they didn't wake me up, so I didn't get to,

110
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,630
但我很想抱抱他们
and I want to.

111
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,990
迈克尔  我必须和你说些事情
Michael, I have to tell you something.

112
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,180
什么事
What is it?

113
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,700
你的  你的父母
Your--your parents,

114
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,150
他们昨晚出了一场车祸
last night they were in a car accident.

115
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,260
但他们会好起来的吧
But they're gonna be okay, right?

116
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,760
迈克尔  他们去世了
Michael, they passed away.

117
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,770
什么
What?

118
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,360
不
No.

119
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,160
不  不可能的
No, they can't be.

120
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,630
你说的不对
You're wrong!

121
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,200
我也希望我错了  宝贝
I wish I were, baby.

122
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,530
我希望我
I wish I...

123
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,200
你为什么不叫醒我
Why didn't you wake me up?

124
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,410
我本可以去医院的
I could have gone to the hospital.

125
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,720
我可以见见他们
I could have seen them!

126
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,290
他们没有坚持到医院  亲爱的
They didn't make it to the hospital, sweetheart,

127
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,130
不到迫不得已的时刻我也不想告诉你
and--and I didn't want to tell you until I had to.

128
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,810
你怎么能这么对我
How could you do this to me?

129
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,670
你怎么能不叫醒我
How could you not wake me up?

130
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,020
这么早起来干什么呢
What are you doing up so early?

131
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,840
没什么  就是翻翻这盒旧东西
Oh, nothing, just going through this old box of stuff.

132
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,280
这和你昨晚
Does that have something to do with

133
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,150
跟特雷弗见面有关吗
you seeing Trevor last night?

134
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,610
是啊  有关
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

135
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,450
他的生活还是那么糟吗
Is he still a mess?

136
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,970
不  他其实过得挺好的
No. No, he's actually doing really well.

137
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,840
那是什么意思
So what do you mean?

138
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,100
我的意思是我今天得请个假
I mean, I need to take the day.

139
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,460
你得请假
You need to take the day?

140
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,020
-是的  -出什么事了吗
- Yeah. - Is there something wrong?

141
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,270
不  没什么事
No, nothing's wrong.

142
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,650
就是有些事情需要处理
Just got something I need to do.

143
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,160
好吧
Okay.

杰克
Jack.

147
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,880
你重新考虑我的提议了吗
Did you reconsider my offer?

148
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,250
辞职那件事吗
About resigning?

149
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,220
不  绝不可能
Yeah, no, not a chance.

150
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,990
但公司章程规定需要给你正式通知
But the bylaws require you to be given formal notice so...

151
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,050
你今天召集了
You're calling for

152
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,910
紧急不信任投票
an emergency vote of no confidence today?

153
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,570
是的
Yes.

154
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,520
你数学真差  杰克
Well, you're shitty at math, Jack,

155
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,800
因为就算我们失去了麦肯诺
because even if we lost McKernon,

156
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,710
一个客户也不足以让所有合伙人反对我
one client is not enough to turn the partners against me.

157
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,390
检查一下你的计算器吧  杰西卡
Check your calculator, Jessica,

158
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,550
因为只有一半合伙人支持你
because you only had half the partners,

159
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,190
并且他们中的每个人都要
and every single one of them is about to lose

160
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,140
在一场恶意收购中失去他们最大的客户了
the biggest client to a hostile takeover

161
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,160
而一切都因为你的领导失职
because of your poor leadership.

162
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,810
我们都知道你唯一在意的恶意收购
We both know the only hostile takeover you care about

163
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,200
就是对这里的
is the one in here.

164
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,290
合个影吧
Take a picture,

165
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,440
因为明天这些名字就要撤下来了
because tomorrow morning, those letters are coming down.

166
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,750
他去哪儿了
Where the hell is he?

167
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
我不知道
I don't know.

168
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,200
格蕾琴  我发誓  如果你还想明天有工作
Gretchen, I swear, if you want to have a job tomorrow,

169
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,810
就最好告诉我哈维去哪了
you better tell me where Harvey is.

170
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,700
皮尔逊女士  我每周日都会为下周
Ms. Pearson, every Sunday I lay out all my outfits

171
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,160
准备好工作装  我也不想
for the coming week, and I have no intention

172
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,770
到了明天就没机会再穿了
of not wearing one of those babies tomorrow.

173
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,150
恕我直言
So with all due respect,

174
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,500
我真的不知道
I don't know.

175
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,930
好吧  如果你还想为下周准备衣服
Well, if you want to pick out your clothes for next week,

176
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,530
你最好把他找出来
you better find the hell out.

177
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,200
哈维  哈维  等等
Harvey. Harvey, wait.

178
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,300
等等  我犯了个错误
Wait. I-I made a mistake.

179
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,860
你别碰我
Don't you touch me.

180
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,970
你不明白
You don't understand.

181
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,790
我知道这是你最后一次骗爸爸了
I understand you made a fool out of dad for the last time.

182
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,010
莉莉  让我试试  哈维
Lily, let me try. Harvey--

183
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,820
你滚出我父亲的房子
You get the hell out of my father's house.

184
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,200
鲍比  出去
Bobby, get--get out.

185
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,990
出去
Get out!

186
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,660
哈维  听我说
Harvey, listen to me.

187
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,530
你不清楚你在做什么
No, you don't know what you're doing.

188
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,490
我非常清楚我在做什么
I know exactly what I'm doing.

189
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,150
哈维  想想这对你父亲会造成什么影响
Harvey, think about what it would do to your father.

190
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,400
还有马库斯  他们受不了的
To Marcus. It'll kill them.

191
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,540
你以前就说过  说以后再也不会这么做了
You said that once before and you'd never do this again.

192
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,290
我知道我说了什么
I know what I said.

193
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,460
我也说过如果你再犯  我就告诉他们一切
And I said if you did I'd tell him everything,

194
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:16,960
我要告诉他们
And I'm going to.

195
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,590
哈维  我求求你
Harvey, I am begging you.

196
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,710
不要拆毁我们
Don't tear us all to pieces.

197
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,390
不要摧毁你的家庭
Don't destroy your family.

198
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,380
你居然敢把罪名扣到我头上
Don't you dare put this shit on me.

199
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,820
哈维
Harvey?

200
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,300
你刚刚在想什么呢
Where did you just go?

201
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,200
不好意思
I'm sorry.

202
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,220
我只是想起了当年我得决定
I was just thinking about the time I had to decide

203
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,750
要不要把我母亲出轨的事
whether or not I should tell my father

204
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,300
告诉我父亲
that my mother was cheating on him.

205
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,770
也许我们应该谈谈这件事
And maybe we should talk about that.

206
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,980
我不是来谈这件事的
I didn't come here to talk about that.

207
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,370
我来这是想弄清楚我到底该不该辞职
I came here to figure out whether or not I should resign.

208
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,630
然后你想起了你的母亲
And then you started thinking about your mother.

209
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,040
如果你的大脑想到了这件事
And if your brain went to the one,

210
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,030
那这两者之间必然有关联
then it's connecting it to the other,

211
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,420
我们现在最好还是
and the best thing we can do right now

212
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,380
努力弄清楚为什么
is to try and figure out why.

213
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,760
我没这个时间
I don't have time for that.

214
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,340
哈维  你要求我给你空出一天来
Harvey, you asked me to block out the day

215
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,620
做紧急咨询  我照做了
for an emergency session, and I did.

216
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,440
我们有的是时间
We have time.

217
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,280
白色的石头最好
The white ones are best.

218
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,060
你只是来劝我进去的
You're just here to make me go in.

219
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,520
没错
I am.

220
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,740
有时候虽然我们还不够成熟
Because sometimes we make choices

221
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,160
却会被迫作出一些决定
we're not old enough to make,

222
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,230
然后我们会后悔
and then we regret them.

223
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,710
我不希望这种事发生在你的身上
I don't want that to happen to you.

224
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,960
为什么我会因为没进那个地方而后悔
Why would I regret not going into that place?

225
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,920
因为你有机会向你父母告别
'cause it's a chance to say good-bye to your parents.

226
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,380
我已经错过了
I already missed that.

227
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,750
迈克
Mike.

228
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,220
有时候  人们失去自己的所爱时
Sometimes when people lose someone they love,

229
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,460
会生他们的气
they get mad at them.

230
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,660
我没有生他们的气
I'm not mad at them.

231
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,220
我生上帝的气
I'm mad at God.

232
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,890
我理解你为什么会生上帝的气
I understand you're mad at God.

233
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,350
你可能都会生我的气
Maybe you're even mad at me, too.

234
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,220
但我是来给你点东西的
But I came out here to give you something.

235
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,070
圣威廉
St. William,

236
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,130
孤儿的守护神
Patron saint of orphans.

237
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,160
你知道他是谁
You know who this is.

238
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,750
我知道所有的守护神
I know who all the saints are,

239
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,960
可我不想要
and I don't want it.

240
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,070
我不想做孤儿
I don't want to be an orphan.

241
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,350
那就不要吧
Then don't take it.

242
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,720
因为实际上  孤儿都是孤独的
Because the truth is, orphans are alone,

243
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,890
可你不孤独
and you're not.

244
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,210
但是你不进去
But not going in there

245
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,860
也改变不了事实
isn't gonna change what happened.

246
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
现在  你的奶奶需要你
And right now, your grandmother needs you.

247
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,770
但如果你留在这里
But if you stay out here,

248
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,540
她今天就只能独自面对一切
she's gonna have to face today alone.

249
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,640
事情定下来了  哈维
Well, it's official, Harvey.

250
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,600
我的手指太老了
My fingers are way too old.

251
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,800
才没有呢
Like hell.

252
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,880
你还是比其他人强
You can still outplay anyone.

253
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,750
你真是太不会撒谎了
You're a terrible liar.

254
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,820
但我不得不承认
But I got to admit,

255
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,280
我还是喜欢在人群中看到我的儿子
I do love seeing my boy in the crowd.

256
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,540
爸爸  其实我想
Actually, dad, there's something

257
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,600
告诉你一些事
I wanted to talk to you about.

258
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,290
我也想和你说点事  非常重要
I got something for you, too. It's important.

259
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,130
乐队要解散了
The band's splitting up.

260
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,960
什么
What?

261
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,530
莱尼说他想和玛姬共同享受退休生活
Lenny says he wants to spend his golden years with Marge,

262
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,440
戴夫的手腕也没有好转  所以...
and Dave's wrist isn't getting any better, so--

263
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,560
那哈利呢
Well, what about Harry?

264
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,310
已经有别的乐团邀请哈利了
Harry's already got an offer from another group.

265
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,330
如果他们要他  那肯定也会要你
Well, if they'll take him, they'll take you.

266
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,220
你没有仔细听  哈维
You're not listening, Harvey.

267
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,600
我不想让他们收我
I don't want them to take me.

268
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
我想回家
I want to come home.

269
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,480
爸爸  音乐是你的生命啊
Dad, music is your life.

270
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,020
哈维  你爷爷死的时候
Look, Harvey, I'm the same age your grandfather was

271
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,300
就是我这个年纪
when he died,

272
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,870
而我已经浪费了太多的时间
and I've already spent way too much of my life

273
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,900
疏远了我的家人
away from my family.

274
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,280
别这么说  你是个超级棒的父亲
Don't start that. You've been a great father.

275
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,060
也许只能算得上够酷  算不上棒
Maybe the cool father, but...not a great one.

276
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,010
我知道现在补偿你已经太晚了
And now, I know it's too late to make that up to you.

277
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,770
我只是希望对于马库斯来说不算太晚
I'm just hoping it's not too late to make it up to Marcus.

278
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,100
这就是我要跟你说的
Anyway, that's my news.

279
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,950
你...你想跟我说什么
What--what did you want to talk about?

280
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,760
没什么  我认识了一个女孩
Nothing. I met a girl.

281
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,580
不错  她叫什么名字
Great. What's her name?

282
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,430
斯科特
Scottie.

283
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,290
只不过是异地恋  我还得自己想想明白
I'm just trying to figure out the long distance thing.

284
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,670
我只能告诉你  如果她是命中注定的那个人
All I can tell you there is, if she's the one,

285
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,680
你会知道的  就像我和你妈妈一样
you'll know, just like with me and your mother.

286
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,880
所以你没有告诉他吗
So you didn't tell him?

287
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,990
没有
No, I didn't.

288
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,530
但是你说那晚你决定要告诉他
But you said that was the night you decided to tell him.

289
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,040
我的确是在那晚决定的
That was the night I decided.

290
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,050
不  你说得好像都是一晚上发生的事
No, you said it as though it was all one night.

291
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,710
我告诉你都是一晚上的事
I told you it was all one night

292
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,340
因为我还是会在说到这事时习惯性撒谎
because I'm so used to lying whenever I tell this story.

293
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,310
我的年龄...
My age--

294
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,520
你为什么要撒谎
Why do you lie?

295
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,150
因为当时我已经是个成年人了
Because I was a grown man when it happened,

296
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,860
而成年人说话
and grown men keep their words

297
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,010
就会算话  而不会
when they say they're gonna do something,

298
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,100
因软弱而屈服
not give in to weakness.

299
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,930
但是你食言并不是因为软弱
But it wasn't weakness that made you break your word.

300
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,270
而是因为对你父亲的爱
It was love for your father.

301
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,100
那我不就是一个混蛋吗
Then aren't I an asshole?

302
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,170
因为两个星期后我把所有事都搞砸了
Because I ended up ruining everything two weeks later.

303
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,460
路易  我要跟你谈谈
Louis, I need to talk to you for a minute.

304
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,080
谈什么
About what?

305
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,960
杰克・索罗夫今天要投票
Jack Soloff is calling for a vote

306
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,180
决定是否撤销我管理合伙人的职位
to remove me as managing partner today.

307
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,220
什么
What?

308
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,800
你给他提名冠名合伙人
Why the hell would he do that

309
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,210
他为什么还要这么做
after you offered to make him name partner?

310
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,280
因为我没有给他提名冠名合伙人
Because I didn't offer to make him name partner.

311
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,510
我让他辞职
I told him to resign.

312
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,590
我们不都计划好了吗
What happened to our plan?

313
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,250
那不是我们的计划  路易
It wasn't our plan, Louis.

314
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,820
那只是你的荒唐想法
It was your insane idea,

315
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,020
我绝不可能照做
and I was never going to do it.

316
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,470
杰西卡
Jessica--

317
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,800
不  你听我说
No, you listen to me.

318
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,640
眼下的重点是
The matter at hand is

319
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,050
确保站在我们这边的人
making sure that we have more people on our side

320
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,950
比他和丹尼尔那边的人多
than he and Daniel have on theirs.

321
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,000
那我该做什么
What am I supposed to do now?

322
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,110
首先  你要严格完成
You are going to do exactly what I told you to do

323
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,940
我当初叫你做的事
in the first place.

324
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,360
你要找出丹尼尔的手上
You're gonna find out what Daniel has

325
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,540
究竟有那个狡猾混蛋的什么把柄
on that weaselly son of a bitch,

326
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,090
而且要在今晚七点前找到
and do it before 7:00 tonight.

327
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,220
因为我要是在那之前拉不到足够多的票
Because if I can't get enough votes before then,

328
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,380
唯一的解决方法就是除掉那个把柄
the only way we win is to make this whole thing go away.

329
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,660
取消我今天的安排
Cancel my day.

330
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,160
我们得谈谈
We have to talk.

331
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,790
我在学习呢  奶奶
I'm studying, grammy.

332
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,870
我才不在乎你说你在干什么
I don't care what you say you're doing.

333
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,550
什么叫我说我在干什么
What I say I'm doing?

334
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,300
沃克神父打来电话
Father Walker called me.

335
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,740
他说你最近很不老实
He said you've been acting out.

336
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,240
沃克神父是个神父
Father Walker's a priest.

337
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,870
嚼个口香糖他都觉得不老实
He thinks you're acting out if you're chewing gum.

338
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,840
我和他想的一样
Well, I agree with him.

339
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,080
可你不在学校  而我一直都考A
Yeah, and you're not at school and all I do is get As.

340
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,540
我不在乎你的成绩
I don't care what you're getting.

341
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,390
我在垃圾桶里找到了这些
I found these in the trash.

342
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,150
那又怎样
So what.

343
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,120
怎样
So what?

344
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,060
《小王子》《詹姆斯与大仙桃》
"The Little Prince," "James and the Giant Peach,"

345
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,140
迈克尔  你不是最喜欢看这些书吗
Michael, you love these books.

346
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,320
那是我小时候爱看的
Yeah, when I was a kid.

347
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,710
这些书
Those books were your connection

348
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,350
是你与父母的联系
to your mother and father.

349
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,470
我现在不想要了
Yeah, well, I don't want them anymore.

350
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,770
这本你也不要了吗
You don't want this one either?

351
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,290
我和你妈妈关系不是很好
Your mother and I didn't always get along,

352
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,070
但我知道你小时候她每晚
but I know that she read this to you every night

353
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,270
都读这本书给你听  她告诉我了
when you were little because she told me.

354
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,100
我也知道你一直不让我读给你听
And I also know that you'd never let me read it to you

355
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,310
因为你说过它是特别的
because you said it was so special.

356
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,640
我说了  我不是小孩子了
Like I said, I'm not a kid anymore.

357
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,330
迈克尔  我很担心你
Michael, I'm worried about you.

358
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,680
沃克神父也很担心
Father Walker is worried.

359
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,060
我不管沃克神父怎么想
I don't care what Father Walker thinks,

360
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,240
我也不在乎这些破书
and I don't care about these stupid books.

361
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,580
我在乎
Well, I do care,

362
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,620
你明天最好去找沃克神父谈谈
And I think you'd better go talk to Father Walker tomorrow

363
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,990
因为你没有全考A
because you're not getting all As.

364
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,090
历史考试他给了你F
He's giving you an F on your history paper.

365
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,050
路易  你怎么来了
Louis, what are you doing here?

366
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,600
史黛西怎么让你进来了
How did you get past Stacy?

367
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,610
她没敢拦
I walked right by her.

368
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,710
那么  有何贵干
Well, in that case, what can I do for you?

369
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,120
我想知道你手上有杰克・索罗夫什么把柄
I want to know what the hell you have on Jack Soloff.

370
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,320
除了他信任我  以及他相信
I have nothing on Jack other than his trust

371
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,130
我是比杰西卡更优秀的律师  别无他物
and confidence that I'm a better attorney than Jessica.

372
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:19,900
你闭嘴吧
Shut your mouth.

373
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,340
你都不配给她舔鞋
You're not fit to lick her boots.

374
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,380
随便  因为那是你的活  路易
Good, because that's your job, Louis,

375
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,210
不是我的
not mine.

376
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,150
听我说
Listen to me.

377
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,420
还记得我说过如果你不说
Remember when I told you I'd kill you

378
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,510
我就杀了你吗
if you so much as tell me the incorrect time?

379
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,530
赶紧告诉我杰克的把柄
Tell me what you have on Jack right now

380
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,850
否则十五秒内我就让你死在这儿
or you're dead in 15 seconds.

381
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,800
我记得你说过什么  路易
I remember when you did that, Louis.

382
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,650
而在那之后  我直接去找了我的律师
And right after that, I went straight to my attorneys

383
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,080
告诉他们你威胁要害我性命
and told them you had threatened my life.

384
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,090
如今你闯到我的办公室又干了一遍
And now, you've come into my office and done it again

385
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,130
还当着证人的面
in front of a witness.

386
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,230
什么证人
What witness?

387
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,870
史黛西  录下来了吗
Stacy, did you get that?

388
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,750
录下了
I got it.

389
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,170
在我看来
So as I see it,

390
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,360
一分钟内保安就会上来
security will be here in about 60 seconds.

391
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,940
所以你要是想杀我
So if you want to kill me,

392
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,490
只有趁现在了
now is your chance.

393
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,730
我发誓  我会找出
I swear to god, I will find out

394
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,040
杰克在你手上的把柄
what you're holding over Jack's head.

395
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,170
深表怀疑
I doubt that,

396
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,760
我非常怀疑你能不能在七点前找到
and I certainly doubt that you'll find it by 7:00.

397
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,630
所以与其告诉你杰克在我手上的把柄
So instead of me telling you what I have on Jack,

398
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,150
不如说说你在我手上的把柄
let me tell you what I have on you.

399
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,910
今天你投票支持我
You vote with me today

400
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,970
你妹妹的公司就安然无恙
and your sister's company lives.

401
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,450
-什么  -其实
- What? - Oh, it turns out

402
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,360
我客户想要进军蛋糕领域
my client is looking to get into the muffin business.

403
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,990
别把我妹妹扯进来
You leave my sister out of this.

404
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,020
没问题
Sure thing.

405
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,510
只要你投票撤杰西卡职
As long as you vote to remove Jessica.

406
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,890
我不能那么做
I can't do that.

407
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,650
那我不仅会收购
Then I'm not only gonna buy it,

408
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,990
还会把她的公司大卸八块
I'm gonna rip that company of hers apart.

409
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,190
你个混蛋  她跟你毫无瓜葛
You son of a bitch! She never did anything to you.

410
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,130
是没有
No.

411
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,990
但你有
But you did.

412
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,560
杰西卡有
And Jessica did.

413
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,210
哈维有
And Harvey did.

414
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,040
所以选择权在你
So you have a choice,

415
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,760
律所  还是家人
Your firm or your family.

416
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,580
迈克尔
Michael?

417
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,410
好久不见
It's been a long time.

418
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,190
最近总有人喊我的全名
People have been calling me that a lot lately.

419
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,600
或许是个预兆
Maybe it's a sign.

420
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,400
有事吗
How can I help you?

421
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,870
我得找人谈谈
I need to talk to someone.

422
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,370
我希望在告解室里谈
I was hoping to do it under the confessional.

423
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,000
离你上次告解有多久了
How long has it been since your last confession?

424
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,860
这话不是应该在开始告解之后再问吗
Aren't you supposed to ask me that after we started?

425
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,890
我们已经开始了
We have started.

426
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,010
坐吧
Have a seat.

427
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,670
就在这里
Here?

428
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,580
不行吗
Why not?

429
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,490
告解是为了净化灵魂
Confession's meant to be good for the soul

430
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,370
没人规定一定要在小黑屋里
and no one's ever said anything about it having to be done

431
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,150
才能完成
in a little dark box.

432
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,290
请坐
Please.

433
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,090
你给我F
You gave that paper an F?

434
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,680
明明可以得A的
It deserves an A.

435
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,640
你上周二翘了一整个下午的课
What about the fact that you cut the entire afternoon

436
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,400
-又怎么解释  -我约了医生
- Last tuesday? - I had a doctor's appointment.

437
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,600
你还有你祖母写的假条
You even had a note from your grandmother.

438
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,740
没错
That's right, I did.

439
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,640
问题是  迈克尔
The problem is, Michael,

440
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,550
你祖母昨天给我写了一张便条
your grandmother wrote me a note yesterday

441
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,300
感谢我让她的读书俱乐部使用图书馆
thanking me for letting her book club use the library.

442
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,420
这两个签名
And those two signatures,

443
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,730
完全不一样
they don't look the same at all.

444
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,550
好吧  既然你这么确定我是翘课
Okay, well, if you're so sure I did this,

445
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,160
那为什么只给我一个F
then why are you only giving me an F

446
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,530
没勒令我停学呢
and not suspending me?

447
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,600
因为我觉得你选择在家长会这天翘课
Because I don't think it's a coincidence that

448
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,580
并不是一个巧合
you chose to cut class on parent-teacher conference day.

449
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,720
跟那个没关系
That had nothing to do with it.

450
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,950
迈克  你祖母跟我说了
Mike, your grandmother told me about

451
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,720
你扔掉的那些书
the books you threw out.

452
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,520
全世界的父母都希望自己的孩子
Every parent in the world is obsessed

453
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,650
清理自己的房间
with their kid cleaning their room.

454
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,350
我只是在清理房间
I actually do it,

455
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,410
你们两个太大惊小怪了
and the two of you make a federal case out of it.

456
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,570
你扔书不是为了清理房间
You didn't throw out those books to clean.

457
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,820
而是因为你看见别的孩子
You did it because you saw those kids out there

458
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,030
都有父母
with their parents,

459
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,230
而你承受不了那种痛苦
and you just couldn't deal with that pain.

460
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,900
所以你翘了课  回到家
So you cut class, you went home,

461
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,980
把那些书都扔了
and you threw away the books.

462
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,070
你又不知道我做了什么
You don't know what I did.

463
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,810
我知道的是  你父母从前每周日都会过来
What I do know is that your parents came here every Sunday

464
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,700
捐钱来换得那身制服
and donated money to pay for that uniform

465
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,030
因为他们想让你在这里接受教育
because they wanted you to be here getting an education

466
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,030
不是让你翘课
and not cutting class.

467
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,950
我每门课的成绩
I've gotten a perfect grade on every assignment

468
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,290
都非常好
I've ever gotten, all right?

469
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,410
我用不着去上你的破课
And I don't need to go to your stupid class to do it.

470
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,000
我可以让你停学
I could have suspended you,

471
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,930
这比打F的惩罚要重多了
and that would have been much worse than an F.

472
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,740
你要么得F  要么就停学
But you're getting one or you're getting the other.

473
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,090
不如你省下一晚上责怪我的时间
So why don't you take one night off from blaming me,

474
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,070
好好想想你要怎么做
and you decided what it is that you're gonna do?

475
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,850
哈维
Harvey,

476
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,980
你在这里做什么
what are you doing here?

477
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,610
我想求你件事
I wanted to ask you something.

478
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,450
我想知道我可不可以在实习期间
I was wondering if I could stay with you

479
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,970
跟你一起住
while I do my clerkship.

480
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,850
你想暑期跟我一起住
You want to stay with me for the summer?

481
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,160
我保证低调到你都察觉不出我的存在
I promise you won't even know I'm there.

482
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,590
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

483
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,050
你知不知道
Do you have any idea

484
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,420
如果被这里的人发现了
what the people around here would think

485
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,190
会怎么想吗
if they found out?

486
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,660
谁说他们会知道了
Who says they're gonna find out?

487
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,470
反正也没人
I mean, no one knows anything

488
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,900
了解你的私生活
about your personal life anyway.

489
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,010
哈维  到底怎么了
Harvey, what's going on?

490
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,980
家里不太顺
Things aren't good at home.

491
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,800
你弟弟的事吗
Your brother?

492
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,750
是我父母
It's my parents.

493
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,600
哈维  我知道
Listen, Harvey, I know what it's like

494
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,310
生活在不和谐的家庭是什么感受
to be living in a home that's not right,

495
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,450
我也知道你可能想要居中调解
and I also know that you might be tempted to fix things.

496
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,940
但这不是孩子应该做的事
But it's not up to the children to fix things.

497
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,170
如果是呢
What if it was?

498
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,190
那么那两个人有问题
Then there's something wrong with those two people.

499
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,520
不  不是这样的
No, there isn't.

500
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,920
是其中一个有问题
There's something wrong with one of them,

501
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,140
我不知道该不该告诉另一个
and I don't know whether to tell the other one or not.

502
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,940
哈维  我无法告诉你该做什么
Look, Harvey, I can't tell you what you should do.

503
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,730
但我可以告诉你  如果你来为我工作
But I can tell you if you come work for me,

504
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,090
你将不得不面对一些困难的谈话
You're gonna have to have some difficult conversations.

505
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,560
工作是工作  家庭是家庭
That's work, this is family.

506
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,360
没有比对家人开诚布公更困难的谈话了
There are no more difficult conversations than that.

507
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,540
但我想让你知道
But for the record,

508
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,000
如果你来这里工作
if you do come work here,

509
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,640
我们也会成为家人
we're gonna be family, too.

510
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,080
你爸爸和马库斯随时都会回来
Your father and Marcus will be here any minute,

511
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,750
我还做了你最爱吃的奶酪鸡
and, oh, I made your favorite, chicken parm.

512
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,210
我很高兴他们不在这里
I'm glad they're not here.

513
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,840
让我有机会告诉你
It'll give me a chance to tell you that

514
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,290
他们在场时我可以装
I'll pretend when they're here,

515
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,180
咱俩独处时我可不想再装下去
but I am not gonna pretend when we're alone.

516
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,090
哈维  拜托  我毕竟是你妈妈
Harvey, please, I'm still your mother.

517
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:34,850
不  你不是
No, you're not.

518
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,190
看谁来了
Hey, hey, hey, look who's here.

519
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,590
我以为你今晚要工作到很晚
I thought you were working late tonight.

520
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,590
你好啊  傻逼
What's up, douche nozzle?

521
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,320
哈维  你还记得
You remember Bobby from down at the shop,

522
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,280
楼下汽修厂的鲍比吧
don't you, Harvey?

523
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,500
他来帮我们修野马老爷车
He's helping us get the old Mustang up and running.

524
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,140
没错  哈维  野马是我的了
That's right, harvey, I'm getting the Mustang.

525
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,960
你要是以为自己能有机会
And if you think you're ever getting behind the wheel

526
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,220
开着过过瘾...
of that car--

527
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,280
我这辈子都不会去开那辆车
I'm never gonna get behind the wheel of that car.

528
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,170
因为你嫉妒
Because you're jealous.

529
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,410
因为那辆车就是坨屎
Because that car's a piece of shit.

530
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,960
哈维  怎么说话呢
Harvey, watch your mouth.

531
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,120
莉儿  多了一个人盘子够用吗
Lil, do we have enough for an extra plate?

532
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,340
当然  你好吗  鲍比
Sure. How you doing, Bobby?

533
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,850
等我把手上的油洗干净就好了
I'll be good as soon as I get this grease off my hands.

534
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,970
洗手间在哪来着
Where's the bathroom again?

535
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,900
过道尽头  鲍比
It's down the hall, Bobby.

536
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,210
知道吗
You know what?

537
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,100
不需要多加盘子了  我不吃
We don't need an extra plate 'cause I'm not eating.

538
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,550
你说什么呢  你回来这么早
What are you talking about? You're home early.

539
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,590
你妈妈还做了奶酪鸡
Your mother made chicken parm.

540
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,500
那你吃呗
Well, why don't you eat it?

541
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,060
因为我再也受不了奶酪鸡了
Because I can't stand chicken parm anymore.

542
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,750
你要去哪  哈维
Where you going? Harvey!

543
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,830
这里可还是我的家
This is still my house, you know.

544
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,670
是吗
Is it?

545
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,310
所以别人知道你的事
So other people know about you?

546
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,220
不是所有人都清楚我的一切  不过...
Not everyone knows everything, but...

547
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,210
有人知道我没有法学文凭
People know that I don't have a law degree.

548
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,980
你说得这么轻描淡写的
You say that as though it were just a technicality.

549
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,460
你说的像是在批评我
And you say that as if you're judging me.

550
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,550
你来这里不就是为了这个吗
Isn't that what you came here for?

551
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,260
我是来寻求建议
I came here for advice.

552
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,320
你说你是来告解的
You said you came here to confess.

553
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,790
不过没关系  因为如果...
But it doesn't matter, because if--

554
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,340
如果你想赦免你的罪
Well, if you're looking for absolution,

555
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,000
我做不到
I can't give it to you.

556
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,840
为什么
Why not?

557
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,150
因为只有悔悟的人才能接受赦免
Because absolution requires contrition,

558
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,860
但我没听出你觉得自己
and I'm not hearing that you even think

559
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,810
做过什么错事
you've done anything wrong.

560
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,170
因为用我的才智帮助别人
Because using my brain to help people

561
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,140
并不是做错事
isn't doing anything wrong.

562
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,280
你不是在用你的才智帮助别人
You're not using your brain to help people.

563
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,760
你是在愚弄别人
You're using it to fool people,

564
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,340
然后你还想让我因此而说你是个好人
and you want me to tell you that you're a good person for it.

565
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,580
我就是个好人
I am a good person.

566
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,550
你是那种什么好事都想占尽的人
You're a person that wants to have their cake and eat it, too.

567
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,580
但恐怕我这里没好处给你
And I'm afraid that I'm all out of cake with you.

568
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,630
这话什么意思
What is that supposed to mean?

569
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,690
意思是说我时常在想
It means that I've often wondered

570
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,850
那天没有报警让你被抓走
whether or not I did the right thing

571
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,250
我到底做的对不对
by not having you arrested that day.

572
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,330
那会彻底毁了我的人生的
That would have completely screwed up my life.

573
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,860
你现在的人生就不叫毁了吗
Oh, and look at how not screwed up it is right now.

574
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,660
你想知道我是什么样的人吗
You want to know what kind of man I am?

575
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,810
你想见我吗  神父
You wanted to see me, Father?

576
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,590
是的
Yes, I did.

577
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,810
我希望请你解释一下
I was hoping you could explain why

578
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,630
为什么我们的募捐箱里少了936美元
we're missing $936 from the collection box.

579
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,440
我没法解释
I can't.

580
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,970
那就奇了  因为这箱子就在我桌子里
Well, that's odd, because this box was in my desk,

581
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,890
而我在我桌子上
and I also found this

582
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,740
找到了这个
on my desk.

583
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,240
迈克尔  下一次你想表达什么信息
Michael, the next time you want to send a message,

584
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,910
在我桌上留张条就好了
just leave me a note.

585
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,320
制服并不是信息  我只是归还给你
The uniform's not a message. I'm just returning it.

586
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,990
你说我有两条路可选
You said I had two options,

587
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,280
要么得F  要么就停学
get an F or get suspended.

588
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,810
但我想到了第三条路
But I thought of a third.

589
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,280
你要退学吗
So you're dropping out?

590
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,210
不  我要转去公立学校
No, I'm going to public school.

591
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,910
而且我并不是说我拿了那笔钱
And I'm not saying that I took that cash,

592
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,280
但就算我拿了  那我也是足够聪明会算数
but if I did, I'd be smart enough to do the math.

593
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,270
我父母每周往募捐盘里放三美元
My parents put $3 in the collection plate every week.

594
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,470
每周三美元  一年52周  一共六年
$3 a week for 52 weeks for six years--

595
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,700
一共936美元
$936.

596
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,210
那我会想这些钱属于我父母
And I would have thought that belonged to my parents

597
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,030
我只是把这些钱拿回来
and I would have just been taking it back.

598
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,370
要知道我完全可以报警让你抓
You know, I could have you arrested.

599
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,170
那就尽管报警吧
Then do it.

600
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,310
迈克尔  你我都知道你有多聪明
Michael, we both know how smart you are,

601
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,070
但聪明和智慧是有区别的
but there's a difference between intelligence and wisdom.

602
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,970
而如果想不明白这一点
And if you don't figure that out eventually,

603
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,900
你将来遇到的问题可要比不及格大得多
you're gonna have a lot bigger problems than an f,

604
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,100
因为你没法聪明过...
because you can't outsmart--

605
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,840
上帝吗
God?

606
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,930
我知道
I know.

607
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,650
我知道你不相信上帝
I know you don't believe in God,

608
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,260
所以我们就称其为...
So let's just call them...

609
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,700
因果
Consequences.

610
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,210
再见  神父
Good-bye, Father.

611
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,770
你什么时候想报警  知道去哪里找我
You want to call the police, you know where to find me.

612
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,940
反正他们也不是
Wouldn't be the first time

613
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,130
第一次给奶奶带去坏消息了
they came to give grammy some bad news.

614
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,630
你一直没有花吗
You never spent it.

615
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,580
一分都没花
Not a penny.

616
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,970
下去
Get out.

617
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,620
下去  哈维  你来跟我打
Hey, get out! Harvey, you and me are going.

618
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,610
现在
Right now.

619
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,360
不  我们不打
No, we're not.

620
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,230
要打
Yes, we are.

621
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,250
不管你想不想
And it's happening whether you like it or not.

622
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,620
想告诉我你在家里发脾气
Now, you wanna tell me what was going on

623
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,700
是怎么回事吗
with that bullshit back at the house?

624
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,880
什么怎么回事
What bullshit?

625
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,190
我只是不饿  所以就走了
I wasn't hungry so I just left.

626
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,310
我才不信呢
I'm not buying it.

627
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,550
我知道你肯定有事
I know something's up with you.

628
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,480
没事
Nothing's up.

629
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,220
没事吗
Nothing?

630
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,900
你弟弟那么高兴见到你
Your little brother was excited to see you

631
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,510
你却连那么点时间也不给他
and you didn't give him the time of day.

632
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,000
马库斯高兴是因为他可以开鲍比的车
Marcus was excited to get Bobby's car.

633
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,070
你从什么时候开始对鲍比有意见了
Since when you got something against Bobby?

634
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,000
他又没对你做什么
He never did anything to you.

635
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,130
别管了  爸爸
Just let it go, dad.

636
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,010
我什么时候开始不能管了
Since when do I do that?

637
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,900
你又什么时候有时间在家管什么了
Since when were you around not to?

638
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,030
你说什么
Excuse me?

639
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,740
我说别管了
I said let it go.

640
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,740
我不会就这么不管了
I'm not letting it go!

641
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,070
你对我无礼
You disrespected me,

642
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,330
对你弟弟和你妈妈无礼
and you disrespected your brother and your mother

643
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,800
还对我们的客人无礼
and our guest.

644
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,810
我知道你肯定有什么事
Now, I know something's up with you.

645
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,740
我想知道是什么
I want to know what it is.

646
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,370
没什么事
It's nothing.

647
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,320
肯定不是没事
It's not nothing!

648
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,830
你为什么非要这样做
Why are you doing this?

649
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,680
因为我儿子有问题
'Cause there's something wrong with my boy.

650
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,870
我有问题
Something's wrong with me?

651
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,550
那你呢
What about you?

652
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,600
你怎么会连自己家里  眼皮底下的事情
How can you not see what is going on under your nose

653
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,670
都视而不见呢
in your own goddamn house?

654
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,770
好了  儿子  停下
All right. Son, stop!

655
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,210
我让她停  而这话本不该我去说
I told her to stop, but I shouldn't have had to.

656
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,640
本不该我去说的
It's shouldn't have been me!

657
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,100
对不起
I'm sorry.

658
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,950
真的很对不起
I'm so sorry.

659
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,940
你让她停下什么
You told her to stop what?

660
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,000
你妈妈干了什么
What was your mother doing?

661
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,410
鲍比
Bobby.

662
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,110
然后你父母的婚姻就结束了吗
So your parents' marriage ended?

663
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,670
早就该结束了
It should have ended sooner.

664
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,520
哈维  我不是要为你妈妈辩护
Harvey, I'm not defending your mother,

665
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,170
但如果你信守诺言没有说出来
but what if you'd kept that promise

666
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,720
而且她和鲍比分手了呢
and then she broke it off with Bobby?

667
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,540
那又有什么区别
What difference does it make?

668
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,210
区别就是
Well, the difference is

669
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,910
你不用那样告诉你父亲
you didn't have to tell your father like that.

670
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,710
我那样告诉他是因为我别无选择
Yeah, I told him like that because I had no choice.

671
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,810
不不不  那样告诉他是你自己的选择
No, no, no, no, telling him like that was your choice.

672
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,250
他在攻击我
He was attacking me.

673
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,540
那你可以放弃反抗
Well, you could have dropped your guard.

674
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,570
我才不会那样做呢
I wasn't gonna do that.

675
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,140
-他是你父亲  -我不在乎
- He was your father. - I don't care!

676
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,320
-为什么  -因为我永远不会拱手认输
- Why? - Because I don't lay down!

677
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,880
所以你没有用更缓和的方式告诉他
And instead of telling him gently

678
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,720
没有冷静地作出决定
and making a decision calmly,

679
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,220
而是更深地伤害了你父亲
you hurt your father even more.

680
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,260
你在说什么
What are you saying?

681
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,220
我是说或许你想起这个故事
I'm saying that maybe you're remembering this story

682
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,840
是想告诉自己
to tell yourself that your decision with Forstman

683
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,490
你跟傅滋曼的协议不是认输
isn't about laying down.

684
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,880
你会跟他对抗到底
It's about something more.

685
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,600
宝贝
Hey, baby.

686
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,330
你永远不会相信这件事
You're never going to believe this.

687
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,860
哈维今天问我能不能和我一起住
Harvey asked if he could live with me today.

688
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,570
令我意外的是你竟然没答应
I'm surprised you didn't say yes.

689
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,380
什么
What?

690
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,740
既然你已经驻扎在办公室了
You already live at the office.

691
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,440
为何不把办公室带回家
Why not just bring it home with you?

692
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,580
奎汀  我告诉过你
Quentin, I told you,

693
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,700
你比我的工作更重要
you mean more to me than work.

694
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,400
但事实胜于雄辩
Well, actions speak louder than words.

695
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,530
我嫁给你了
I married you.

696
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,880
没错
You did.

697
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,800
但哈维还有律所里其他人知道吗
But does Harvey or anyone else at the office know that?

698
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,500
或者有任何人知道我的存在吗
Or even know that I exist?

699
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,730
你知道我很注重个人隐私
You know I'm a private person.

700
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,830
我想分隔这两部分的生活
I like to keep those parts of my life separate.

701
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,270
但就我所知隔离但平等在外头行不通
What I know is, separate but equal didn't work out there,

702
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,870
在这里也一样不行
and it's not working in here.

703
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,100
你这话是什么意思
Where are you going with this?

704
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,180
别明知故问  杰西卡
You know where this is going, Jessica,

705
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,300
这么长时间了你明白的
where it's been going for a long time.

706
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,830
我想离婚
I want a divorce.

707
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,720
什么
What?

708
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,450
我们的婚姻持续不下去了
This isn't working anymore.

709
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,620
这和丽莎有关吗
Does this have anything to do with Lisa?

710
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,690
没有  这与我们俩有关
No. This has to do with us.

711
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,190
你是指我吧
Oh, you mean me.

712
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,020
没错
I do.

713
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,470
你就能一心扑在你最看重的事情上了
Now you can focus on what really matters to you...

714
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,300
你的事业
Your career.

715
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,340
杰西卡  能和你聊几句吗
Jessica, can I talk to you?

716
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,240
我猜你还没有找到
I take it you haven't found out

717
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,570
哈德曼掌握的杰克的把柄
what Hardman has on Jack.

718
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,820
确实还没  但有其他事情
I haven't, but there's something else.

719
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,840
没关系了
Doesn't matter.

720
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,800
我争取到了票数
I got us the votes.

721
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:56,770
真的吗
You did?

722
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,350
我去找了保罗・波特劝他
I went to Paul Porter and I turned him

723
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,180
还有跟随他的另外三票支持我们
and the three votes that he comes with.

724
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,330
那我们三票领先了吗
So we're up by three?

725
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,900
没有  加上哈维才领先一票
No, including Harvey, we're up by one.

726
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,670
不是这样
No, we're not.

727
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,790
哈德曼要对付埃斯特的公司
Hardman's going after Esther's company.

728
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,760
除非你投票反对我  否则他不会罢手
And he's not going to back off unless you vote against me.

729
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,810
-路易  -我知道你要说什么  
- Louis-- - I know what you're gonna say.

730
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,980
我们能阻止他
We can stop it.

731
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,350
但我找了杰夫瑞让他别卖股份
But I went to Jeffrey to get him to not sell his shares,

732
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,390
他说哈德曼愿意多给40%的价钱收购
and he told me that Hardman's offering 40% over asking.

733
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,940
即使杰夫瑞答应不卖  还有其他人卖
Jeffrey agreed not to sell, but everyone else will.

734
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,700
假如哈德曼买不到股份  
If Hardman can't get the stocks,

735
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,760
他就会去收购经销商
he's gonna buy the distributor,

736
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,850
如果他收购不了经销商
and if he can't buy the distributor,

737
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,130
他会针对公司的合同
he's gonna go after the contracts.

738
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,110
-路易  -傅滋曼是他的靠山
- Louis-- - Forstman is his backer!

739
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,190
我知道
I know.

740
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,870
既然你知道他有无限的资源
Well then, you know that he has unlimited resources,

741
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,880
我不能加入这场四面是敌的战斗
and I can't fight a war on multiple fronts.

742
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,010
我本可以告诉你的是如果你站我这边
And I could tell you that if you side with me,

743
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,030
我们能想出法子救埃斯特的公司
we'll figure out a way to save Esther's company.

744
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,430
但我也有妹妹
But I have a sister, too.

745
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,540
抱歉
I'm sorry.

746
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,070
路易
Louis...

747
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,580
不管发生什么
Whatever happens,

748
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,600
我希望你知道...
I want you to know...

749
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,500
皮尔逊总是会把利特当作
Pearson will always consider Litt

750
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,660
她的好伙伴的
her partner.

751
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,830
杰西卡
Jessica.

752
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,600
如果这次不是他妹妹
If it had been anybody other than his sister,

753
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,050
他肯定不会考虑...
he would never even consider--

754
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,720
我知道  唐娜
I know, Donna.

755
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,000
你不用替他道歉
And you don't have to apologize for him

756
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,400
因为我明白丹尼尔・哈德曼有多混蛋
because I know what a bastard Daniel Hardman is.

757
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,000
有什么能帮你的吗
Is there anything I can do?

758
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,290
有一件事
Yes.

759
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,090
在投票前我们还有时间
We still have some time before the vote.

760
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,070
我上午让格蕾琴去找哈维
I asked Gretchen to find Harvey this morning.

761
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,160
但我拜托错了人
I asked the wrong person.

762
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,710
我会找到他的
I'll find him.

763
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,550
我就知道这是个错误
I knew this was a mistake.

764
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,970
我不该来这里
I never should have come here.

765
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,420
迈克尔  你其实不必来这里
Michael, you didn't actually have to come here.

766
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,230
我已经清楚你的故事了
I already knew your story.

767
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,580
特雷弗半年前来见过我
Trevor came to see me six months ago.

768
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,650
我知道
Yeah, I know that.

769
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,100
但你不知道他讲得最多的是
Yeah, but you didn't know he spent most of that time

770
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,000
他为发生在你身上的事情
talking about you or the fact that he blames himself

771
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,820
感到深深的自责
for everything that happened to you.

772
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,240
或许他应该自责
Well, maybe he should.

773
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,990
或许你该责怪自己
Maybe you should blame yourself.

774
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,300
没错  或许每次地震每场战争
Right, and maybe I should blame myself

775
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,660
我都该责怪自己
for every earthquake or every war.

776
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,160
你的虚荣也够了  迈克尔
That's enough of the vanity, okay, Michael.

777
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,840
-虚荣  -对  虚荣  自我放纵
- Vanity? - Yeah, vanity, self-indulgence,

778
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,000
随便叫什么吧  反正从那晚之后
whatever you want to call feeling sorry for yourself

779
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,160
-你就自怨自艾  -你竟敢这么说
- ever since that night... - How dare you.

780
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,270
-就是这样你才会让身陷这境地  -不
- Because that's exactly why you're in this position right now. - No!

781
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,930
我身处这种境地是特雷弗害我的
I'm in this position because Trevor put me in this position.

782
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:03,740
不  迈克尔  不是这样的
No, Michael, no.

783
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,470
这就是你和特雷弗的差别所在
That's the difference between you and Trevor.

784
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,760
他其实接受这一切都是自己的选择
He's actually accepted that his choices were his own,

785
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,330
也就是说他真想去改变自己的生活
which means he actually wants to change his life.

786
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,280
你觉得我不想改变吗
You think I don't want to change?

787
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,360
那你说我现在在这里做什么
Why the hell do you think I'm here?

788
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,870
我不知道  你为什么来这儿
I don't know. Why are you here?

789
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,170
我说了  我需要建议
I told you, I want advice.

790
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,620
不不  人们不需要通过告解的保护
No, no, people do not need the protection of the confessional

791
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,220
来获得建议
to get advice.

792
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,330
我那么做是为了保护你
I did that to protect you.

793
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,630
你那么做是为了保护你自己
No, you did that to protect you.

794
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,410
所以你现在告诉我  你为什么来这里
So you tell me right now, why are you here?

795
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,090
-一言难尽  -一言可尽
- It's not that simple. - It is that simple.

796
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,630
-我说不清  -你为什么来这里
- I can't. - Why are you here?

797
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,340
因为我害怕
Because I'm afraid!

798
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,430
你在怕什么  迈克尔
What are you afraid of, Michael?

799
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,830
他们都弃我而去
They left me all alone.

800
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,440
现在你找到了爱你的人
And now you've found someone who loves you...

801
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,010
如果你不再是这样的自己
and if you stop being who you are,

802
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,280
你害怕她也会抛下你
you're afraid she'll abandon you, too.

803
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,980
我该怎么做  神父
What am I gonna do, Father?

804
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,470
跟我来  迈克尔
Come with me, Michael.

805
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,610
我给你看个东西
I want to show you something.

806
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,680
你为什么告诉他
Why'd you tell him?

807
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,430
他有权知道
He needed to know.

808
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,190
他需要的是我们这个家
What he needed was for us to be a family.

809
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,540
家不是建立在谎言上的
Families aren't built on lies.

810
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,250
现在地基连谎言都不是  而是一摊烂泥了
Well, now all we are is built on shit

811
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,480
因为你这么做  除了你之外谁都不开心
Because nobody's happy about what you did except for you.

812
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,710
我这么做不是为了我自己
I didn't do this for me.

813
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,550
你就是无法忍受
You couldn't stand that

814
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,950
这一切都将是我的了的事实
I was about to have them all to myself.

815
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,400
你觉得我这么做是为了和你抢什么吗
You think I did this to take something away from you?

816
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,510
你就是抢走了我的东西
You did take something away from me.

817
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,150
你还不明白
You don't get it.

818
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,070
你可以回你的法律学校
You get to go back to law school,

819
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,170
通过律师资格考试
and you're gonna pass the bar,

820
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,150
过你前途光明的美好生活
and you're gonna go live your big hotshot life,

821
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,940
只剩我一个人孤零零留在这里
and I'm gonna be stuck here on my own.

822
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,990
-你不是孤身一人  -是吗
- You're not on your own. - Really?

823
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,130
不知道你注意到没有  但妈妈刚走了
I don't know if you noticed, but mom just left

824
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,370
爸爸也不愿意出屋子  我还有谁
and dad's not coming out of his room, so who's here for me?

825
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,060
所以两周后我在市里租了间房子
So two weeks later I got a place in the city,

826
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,870
搬了出来  再也没回去过
I moved out, and I never went back.

827
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,760
这一切之后  你却丢下了你父亲和你弟弟
You left your brother and your father alone after all that?

828
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,800
我也不想这么做的
I didn't want to.

829
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,960
那你为什么还这么做
Then why did you?

830
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,650
因为我无法接受
Because I couldn't take knowing that

831
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,670
是我把一切搞得支离破碎这个事实
I was the one that tore everything to pieces.

832
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,410
现在你觉得如果你辞职  一切又会重演
And you think you'll be doing that again if you resign?

833
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,440
如果我辞职就是会重演
I will be doing that again if I resign.

834
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,470
我认为后退一步
Well, I think stepping down

835
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,490
并不会破坏一切
isn't tearing everything to pieces.

836
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,200
我认为这是个拯救一切的机会
I think it's a chance to keep everything together.

837
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,720
是她给了我重新开始的机会
She gave me my start.

838
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,790
哈维  有次我说杰西卡听起来
Harvey, I once commented that Jessica sounds like

839
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,800
真是个女强人
a hell of a woman,

840
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,480
然后你说  那又怎样
and you said, "What does it matter?"

841
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,090
是你给我留下了她是个
Well, you're the one who led me to believe

842
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,240
女强人的印象
she's a hell of a woman.

843
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,570
也许是有理由的
Maybe you did it for a reason.

844
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,500
什么理由
What reason?

845
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,950
为了让我说她应该会理解
For me to suggest that maybe she'll understand

846
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,680
你离开并不代表你不在乎她了
that you leaving doesn't mean that you don't care about her.

847
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,660
恰恰代表你在乎
It means that you do.

848
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,310
那如果我告诉你不是为了这个呢
And what if that's not why I told you all this?

849
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,420
如果是你错了呢
What if you're wrong?

850
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,470
那我就承认错误
Then I'll be wrong.

851
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,610
那你也一定能解决此事
And you'll be able to handle that.

852
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,660
我以前经常就待在这个屋呢
I spent a lot of time here.

853
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,000
你还记得这里
You remember this place?

854
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,700
我过目不忘
I remember everything.

855
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,350
我知道  迈克尔
I know you do, Michael.

856
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,600
我一直都知道你与众不同
I was always aware of what a special child you were.

857
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,140
这里一点都没变啊
Hasn't changed a bit.

858
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,060
一点都没吗
Hasn't it?

859
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,030
什么意思
What are you talking about?

860
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,350
迈克尔  我觉得你来见我
Michael, I think you came to see me

861
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,020
是因为当人们遇到困难的时候
because when people are in crisis

862
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,640
总会怀念曾经的拥有
they're searching for something more,

863
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,880
拥有但失去的那些
usually something they've lost.

864
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,380
我失去了父母  再也找不回来了
I lost my parents, and I'm not getting them back.

865
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,970
不  迈克尔  你失去的是信念
No, Michael, you lost your faith.

866
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,070
奶奶
Grammy.

867
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,240
你离开学校的第二天
The day after you left school

868
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,030
她就把钱还回来了
she gave me the money back.

869
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,670
她唯一的要求是让我们用其中部分
Her only request was that we use some of it

870
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,540
买下这个书架
to buy this bookcase

871
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,280
来保留这些书
to keep these books together.

872
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,390
这些是我父亲的书
They're my father's books.

873
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,580
还有你母亲的
And your mother's.

874
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,600
{\an8}深情怀念
伊迪丝・罗斯

875
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,560
我一直不明白她为什么这么做
I never knew why she did it.

876
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,490
现在我明白了
And now I do.

877
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,730
迈克  如果你在担心自己一旦改变
Michael, if you're worried about Rachel leaving you,

878
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,680
瑞秋就会离开你
if you stop doing what you're doing,

879
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
我想她不会的
I don't think she will.

880
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,560
你怎么知道
How do you know?

881
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,290
因为我有信念
'Cause I have faith.

882
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,880
有事吗
Can I help you?

883
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,110
我只是
I was just--

884
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,500
他人呢
Where is he?

885
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,770
你问谁
Where is who?

886
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,320
哈维
Harvey.

887
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,540
拜托  我找他有急事
Please, it's an emergency.

888
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,350
抱歉  他不在这里
Well, I'm sorry, he's not here,

889
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,220
而且恐怕我并不知道他去了哪里
and I'm afraid I don't know where he went.

890
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,930
抱歉  我只是
I'm sorry, I just--

891
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,250
你介意我在这里坐一会儿吗
Do you mind if I just sit here for a minute?

892
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,110
请便
Of course.

893
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,450
也许你比我更了解现在的状况吧
You probably know more about what's going on that I do, don't you?

894
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,480
抱歉  这个问题我不能回答
I'm sorry, I can't respond to that.

895
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,030
既然我也来了
As long as I'm here...

896
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,140
谢谢你
Thank you.

897
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,520
谢我什么
For what?

898
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,430
几周前哈维终于原谅了我
A few weeks ago Harvey finally forgave me

899
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,740
去为路易工作的事
for going to Louis.

900
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,980
我知道如果不是他来找了你
And I know he never would have done that

901
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,380
肯定不会的
if he hadn't come to see you.

902
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,810
抱歉  这个问题我也不能回答
I'm sorry, I can't respond to that either.

903
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,910
其实你已经回答了
You just did.

904
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,960
再次谢谢你  为你此刻的想法
And thank you again for what you're thinking.

905
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,970
我在想什么
And what is that?

906
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,190
你在想如果不是我
That he never would have come to see you

907
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,560
他也不会来找你
if it hadn't been for me.

908
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,200
你真能读懂人心
You really can do that.

909
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,530
是的
Yeah, I can.

910
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,190
事实上  我还知道你现在在想什么
In fact, I can tell you what you're thinking right now.

911
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,430
什么
What is that?

912
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,000
你在想两件事  事实上
You're thinking two things, actually.

913
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,220
其一  这女人要当心理咨询师肯定很厉害
One, this woman would make an excellent therapist.

914
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,330
其二
And two...

915
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,930
哈维不知道他错过了多好的人
Harvey has no idea what he's missing.

916
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:27,490
看来哈维不会来了
Well, it seems Harvey won't be joining us,

917
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,150
所以不如现在开始吧
so we may as well get started.

918
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,000
我们今天聚集一堂是因为
We're here because there's a concern

919
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,470
大家担心我已不再将公司利益放在首位
that I no longer have the best interests of the firm at heart

920
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:42,100
而是只关心某些个人的
but am instead focused on the selfish interests

921
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,800
私人利益
of certain individuals.

922
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,520
对那些这么想的人
For those of you who feel that way,

923
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,690
此刻我也无法做什么
there's not much I could do

924
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,390
来改变你们的看法
at this point to change your minds.

925
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,820
所以我只能说
So...I'll say...

926
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,400
希望我还有幸能继续为律所服务
I hope it remains my pleasure to serve this firm.

927
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,260
我觉得我们该投票了
I think it's time we vote.

928
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,410
你要不说点什么来让他们改主意
Well, if you're not gonna say anything to change their mind,

929
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,080
那我来
Then I will.

930
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,580
你真的来了
You made it.

931
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,480
什么也阻止不了我
Wouldn't have missed it for the world.

932
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,350
好吧  你来了
Okay, fine, you're here,

933
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,240
但你也没法说什么来为她辩护
but there's nothing that says you can plead her case.

934
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,350
也没规定他不能说话
And there's nothing that says he can't,

935
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,910
所以你干嘛不坐下听听
so why don't you sit your ass down?

936
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,440
那就说吧  赶紧发表完你的演讲
Go ahead, then, get your speech over with

937
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,720
我们就可以投票了
so we can get to the vote.

938
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,330
我没什么演讲  只有这个
No speech, just this.

939
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,900
一封解约书
A termination letter.

940
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,580
此时此刻  狙击我们客户的公司
As of now, the company that's been targeting our clients

941
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,640
已经不由丹尼尔・哈德曼代理了
is no longer represented by Daniel Hardman.

942
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,620
-胡说  -那你打给他问问
- Bullshit. - Go ahead, call him.

943
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,670
当然  打电话可能得花点时间
Of course, it might take a while

944
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,580
因为你得经过监狱总机
since you've got to go through the prison switchboard

945
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,750
才能联系到他
to get ahold of him.

946
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,160
是的  没错
Yep, that's right.

947
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,560
那就是杰克・索罗夫和丹尼尔・哈德曼合作的人
That's the kind of man Jack Soloff and Daniel Hardman

948
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,670
已经进了监狱的家伙
do business with, one who's already behind bars.

949
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,200
我说清楚吧
Look, let me be clear.

950
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,740
此次对律所的攻击  其实是冲我个人来的
The attack on this firm was an attack on me.

951
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,030
丹尼尔为他离所的事责怪我
Daniel blamed me for having to leave this firm,

952
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,940
{\an8}《好奇的乔治》  作者H・A・雷

953
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:55,650
所以想在伤我最痛的地方下手
so he was trying to hit me where it hurt the most,

954
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:59,220
{\an8}迈克尔  要记得  关心你的人
永远会在你身边帮助你走出困境  爱你的爸爸妈妈

955
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,020
也就是这间律所
namely this firm

956
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,890
跟我的合伙人及朋友
and my partners and my friends.

957
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,180
但这一切都结束了
But that's over.

958
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,740
他已经没有钱
He has no more money,

959
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,760
没有力量  没有朋友了
no more power, no more friends.

960
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,290
你们每个人  将要投票决定
All of you, you're about to vote on whether

961
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,830
杰西卡是否应该继续管理这间律所
Jessica should continue running this firm.

962
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,580
我知道你们中有些人认为  她对我的行为
Now, I know some of you think that she's turned a blind eye

963
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,740
以及我冒的风险睁一只眼闭一只眼
to my behavior and--and the risks I've taken,

964
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,570
可你们试图替换她才是最大的冒险
but for you to remove her would be the greatest risk of all.

965
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,440
因为我知道
Because if there's one thing I know,

966
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,770
杰西卡・皮尔逊在乎这间律所
it's that Jessica Pearson cares about this firm

967
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,940
和律所中的每个人
and everyone in it.

968
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,720
因为对她而言  我们不仅是同事
Because to her, we're not just colleagues

969
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,380
甚或朋友
or even friends,

970
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,470
而是家人
we're family.

971
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,460
谢谢你  哈维
Thank you, Harvey.

972
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,350
我们来投票吧
Let's vote.

973
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,360
杰西卡  我觉得我们不需要不记名投票
Jessica, I don't think we're gonna be needing the ballots.

974
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,050
我们每个人都知道自己的立场
I think everybody knows where they stand.

975
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,220
所有支持杰西卡留下的人  举手
All in favor of Jessica staying.

976
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,350
那我想这里所有人都很乐意
Then I guess everyone here is happy

977
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,580
事情保持原状  除了一位
keeping things the way they are, except for one.

978
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,710
太好了你在这儿  我有话跟你说
I'm glad you're here. I need to tell you something.

979
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,080
无论要说什么  我给你这个之后
Whatever it is, it might not matter

980
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,490
就都不重要了
after I give you this.

981
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,680
那是什么
What is it?

982
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,030
哈维  你不光给了我梦想
Harvey, you didn't just give me my dream.

983
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,050
还给了我一个家
You gave me a family.

984
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,660
但我终有一天会有自己的家
But I'm gonna have a family of my own someday,

985
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:55,070
我不能让这些事悬在他们头上
and I can't have all of this hanging over their heads.

986
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,550
你要辞职
You're resigning.

987
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,450
是的
I am.

988
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,730
你记得有次你问我为什么雇你
You know, you once asked me why I hired you,

989
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,710
我跟你说  因为生活的高度在这里
and I told you it was because life is like this

990
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,020
而我在这里
and I like this.

991
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,350
哈维  拜托  你不可能劝我...
Harvey, please, you can't convince me--

992
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,500
让我说完
Let me finish.

993
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,430
能有这个高度
It was like this

994
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,320
原因不在于我们担的风险
not because of the risk we're taking.

995
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,890
而是因为你是你
it's because of who you are.

996
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,540
所以你不失望
So you're not disappointed?

997
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,560
你开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

998
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,090
说了那么多  你不这么做
After that speech, if you hadn't done this,

999
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,310
我也会踢你走
I'd be kicking you out.

1000
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:39,880
而且再说一句
And for the record,

1001
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,330
你不是这里唯一获得更多家人的人
You're not the only one who got more family out of this deal.

1002
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,480
你真的好美
You really are so beautiful.

1003
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,220
荧光灯底下没人美的
No one's beautiful in fluorescent light.

1004
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,170
你就美
You are.

1005
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,840
你的神秘冒险怎么样了
So how did your mysterious adventure go?

1006
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,570
得到你想要的东西了吗
Did you get what you needed?

1007
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,540
得到了
I did.

1008
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,710
这是什么
What's this?

1009
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,050
提前的结婚礼物
Early wedding present.

1010
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,790
迈克  这是...
Mike, this is--

1011
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,700
我辞职信的副本
A copy of my letter of resignation.

1012
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,340
如果这跟克莱尔
If this is about the thing with Claire

1013
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,580
或者我跟我妈妈的争吵有关...
or the fight that I got into with my mom--

1014
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,610
没关系
It's not.

1015
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,040
这只关于我们要好好开始我们的生活
This is about us starting our life right,

1016
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,680
干干净净地开始
with a clean slate.

1017
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,480
你不必为我这么做
You don't have to do this for me.

1018
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,390
我不是为你
I'm not.

1019
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,840
是为了我们
I'm doing it for us.

1020
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:49,990
因为只要你支持我...
Because as long as you're with me--

1021
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,010
我支持你
I'm with you.

1022
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,380
那就让我跟我的办公室说再见吧
Well then, let me go say good-bye to my office,

1023
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,300
然后我们回家
and let's go home.

1024
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,020
{\an8}奥登・斯佩克特

1025
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,540
我们还没来得及庆祝你就走了
You walked out before we got a chance to celebrate.

1026
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,450
抱歉  只是我那一天过得太艰难了
I'm sorry. It's just been a long day.

1027
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,440
哈维  你到底是怎么从傅滋曼那儿
Harvey, how exactly did you get that termination letter

1028
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,600
拿到解约书的
from Forstman?

1029
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,600
我们明早再谈吧
Let's talk about it in the morning.

1030
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,580
哈维
Harvey.

1031
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,310
我同意辞职
I agreed to step down.

1032
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,620
当然不行
Absolutely not.

1033
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,850
你不能辞职
You are not going to step down.

1034
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:37,810
这事定了
It's done.

1035
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,000
没什么定了
Nothing's done.

1036
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,540
杰西卡  你为这律所付出了一切
Jessica, please, you've given up everything for this firm.

1037
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,980
该有人为你付出点东西了
It's time someone gave up something for you.

1038
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,920
我不想让你做那个付出的人呢
What if I don't want you to be the one to do that?

1039
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,900
那就原谅我  因为我要做
Then forgive me, because I am.

1040
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,920
好消息是迈克・罗斯要离开
Good news is Mike Ross is leaving.

1041
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,880
我从没想过我会这么说
I never thought I'd say this,

1042
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,200
但现在
but this moment,

1043
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,250
它看起来不是什么好消息
it doesn't feel like good news.

1044
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,360
迈克尔・詹姆斯・罗斯
Micheal James Ross?

1045
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,110
怎么
Yes?

1046
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,780
你因共谋诈骗被捕了
You're under arrest for conspiracy of fraud.
