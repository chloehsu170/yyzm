事情不是你想的那样
That is not what it looked like.

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,230
告诉我事情是怎么样的  妈
Tell me what it looked like, Mom.

35
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,320
我爸被人陷害而锒铛入狱
Because my dad is in jail for something he didn't do

36
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,950
你却在和害他坐牢的人乱搞
and you're fucking the man who put him there?!

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,820
不许你这么跟我说话
Don't you use that language with me!

38
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,340
-我是想劝劝他  -真的吗
- I'm trying to talk some sense into him. - Oh, really?

39
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,660
怎么个劝法让他把衬衫都脱了
See, what kind of sense requires him to take off his shirt?

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
你觉得呢
What kind do you think?

41
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,600
我的天  你认真的吗
Oh, my God. Seriously?

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,250
你想说你是为了爸才这么做的吗
You're telling me you're doing this for Dad?

别告诉你爸  拜托了
don't tell-tell Dad, please.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,370
他会痛不欲生的

好  一切进展顺利  有多大

长三厘米  宽一厘米

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,880
缝几针就好
A couple of bites should do it.

58
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,180
只是来回穿引而已
Just tie and repeat.

59
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,500

考虑到你们芝加哥的谋杀率  我很担心

密切关注他  我们可不想出现什么大差错

116
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,720
似乎和朋友随便聊聊天就能把问题解决了
and it seemed easier to just go talk to some friends.

117
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,050
我是这里的调查员

I know. I shouldn't be interrupting you,

124
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,140
但皮科医生来电找你

我还是得去见我父亲

我得警告他  我认为他被陷害了
I need to warn him. I think he's being set up.

136
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,160

Wait, you're going now?

141
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,360
不  我是要和你一起去见你父亲

No, I don't need...

143
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,710
这没得商量
That's nonnegotiable.

144
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,500
玛娅  你会在某个时候告诉客户说
Maia, there will be a moment when you tell a client,

145
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,250
"请一定照我说的做  这是为了你好"
"For your own good, you have to do what I say."

146
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,310
对于你来说  现在就是那样的时候
This is one of those moments for you.

所以我会允许你去探监
So, I'll allow you to visit your dad in prison,

148

我会听到你对他说的每一个字
I'm gonna hear everything you say to him

150
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,140
以及他对你说的每一个字
and everything he says to you,

151
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,250
这样谈话会受到律师与当事人保密协定的保护
so it's subject to attorney/client privilege.

152
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,100
明白了吗
Do you understand?

153
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,630
皮科医生吗
Oh, Dr. Picot?

154

我是戴安·洛哈特  你失职案的律师

我知道  说我是恐怖分子支持者

157
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,720
这会让我的牧师大吃一惊
Won't my rabbi be surprised.

158
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,340
你当时在指导位于叙利亚的开胸手术吗
And you were conducting open-heart surgery in Syria?

159
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,480
叙利亚一直缺乏医疗人员
Medical personnel have been so depleted in Syria

160
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,890
无国界医生一直在为他们提供支持
that Doctors Without Borders is providing technical support

161
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,170
用视频电话指导非专业人士
via Skype to nondoctors there.

162
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,330
我明白了  好的
I see, well, good.

163
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,390
这只是传讯  为了获取保释
So, this is merely an initial appearance to secure pretrial release,

164
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,290
所以应该不会有什么问题
so it should go fairly smoothly.

165
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,200
你明显没有弃保潜逃的风险
So, you're clearly not a flight risk.

166
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,720
我在加拿大安大略省有钓鱼度假屋
Well, I do have a fishing cabin in Ontario,

167
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,530
但它连厕所都要凑合着用
but it barely has a toilet.

168
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,540
我挺喜欢你的  医生  你很风趣
I like you, Doctor. I think you're funny,

169
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,310
但法庭不会喜欢这样
but the court doesn't do well with funny.

170
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,120
明白了  我会闭嘴的
Got it. Zip it.

171
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,000
你知道他是恐怖分子吗
Uh, did you know he was a terrorist?

172
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,860
什么
Excuse me?

173
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,180
你叙利亚的病人  你知道他是恐怖分子吗
Your patient in Syria, did you know he was a terrorist?

174
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,430
你们俩是一起的吗
Are you two together?

175
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,000
因为我希望她也在场  就这么简单
Because I want her there, that's all.

176
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,890
这还是你的案子  戴安
It's still your case, Diane.

177
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,200
这只是传讯
It's an initial appearance.

178
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,760
我不需要人手把手地帮忙
I don't need hand-holding with an initial appearance.

179
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,570
谁说是要帮忙了
Who said anything about hand-holding?

180
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,080
卢卡什么也没做
Lucca wasn't doing anything,

181
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,550
她有处理联邦法院案件的经验
and she has experience in federal court.

182
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,490
芭芭拉  我曾是全市最大的律所
Barbara, I was a name partner

183
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,580
的冠名合伙人
at the town's biggest firm.

184
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,200
没错  而我是你现在律所的冠名合伙人
Yes, and I'm a name partner at this firm.

185
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,550
我没有质疑你的意思
I'm not questioning that.

186
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,910
戴安  你还在你的律所的时候
At your firm, Diane,

187
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,200
你有时不也会驳回初级合伙人的意见吗
did you sometimes overrule the judgment of junior partners?

188
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,290
所以你是在教训我应该谦卑点儿吗
So this is a lesson in humility?

189
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,600
不是
No.

190
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,130
公诉人是科林·莫雷洛
The prosecutor is Colin Morrello.

191
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,050
他是最厉害的助理联邦检察官
He is their top AUSA.

192
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,050
所以让你们合作并不是坏主意  不是吗
It isn't wrong to have you two working together, okay?

193
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,700
好吧
Okay.

194
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,570
祝你好运
Good luck.

195
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,780
好吧  再见
Right. Bye.

196
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,200
你为什么要那么做
Why are you really doing that?

197
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,460
你什么意思  我想让她俩合作而已
What do you mean? I want them to work together.

198
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,580
不  芭芭拉  你在展示权力
Mm-mm, no, Barbara, it's a power play.

199
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,600
我能听出你的语气
Now, I know that sound in your voice

200
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,580
你别有企图的语气
when you've got some kind of hidden agenda.

201
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,270
她占了卢卡的办公室
She got Lucca's office.

202
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,160
我不想失去卢卡
I don't want to lose Lucca.

203
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,440
她需要感受到我们的重视
She needs to feel needed.

204
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,000
你看  这就是权力的问题
See, here's the problem with power.

205
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,960
赋予某人权力则意味着剥夺另一人的权力
You got to take it from somebody to give it to somebody else.

206
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,440
谢谢你  孙子
Thank you, Sun Tzu.

207
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,420
芭芭拉
Barbara.

208
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,920
对戴安友善点儿
Be nice to Diane.

209
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,950
别再这样管着她了  好吗
Don't rule it over her like that, huh?

210
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,560
我有质疑过你的领导决定吗
Do I question your leadership?

211
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,570
你总在质疑
All the time.

212
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,560
好吧
Okay.

213
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,210
我会照做的
I'll behave.

214
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,550
很好
Good.

215
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,540
文图拉网桥律师费的事怎么样了
Now what's going on with our Ventura Bridge retainer?

216
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,340
钱什么时候到位
Is it coming?

217
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,310
我们今天和他们的执行总裁吃午饭
Yeah, we're having lunch with the CEO today.

218
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,790
我们会把这事弄清楚的
We'll get to the bottom of it.

219
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,070
友善点儿
Be nice.

220
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,370
早上好  法官阁下
Good morning, Your Honor.

221
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,900
早安  莫雷洛先生  很高兴见到你
Good morning, Mr. Morrello. Always a pleasure.

222
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,130
我也感到荣幸
Likewise.

223
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,620
因被告有潜逃危险且危及社会
The government asks the defendant be detained pending trial,

224
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,940
控方请求将其还押候审
both as a flight risk and a danger to the community.

225
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,420
开什么玩笑  危及什么社会了
Seriously, what kind of danger to the community?!

226
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,370
{\an8}他是没有任何犯罪前科的著名医生
He's a renowned doctor with no record.

227
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,570
我好像激起民愤了  法官阁下
Oh, I seem to have struck a chord over there, Your Honor.

228
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,910
是的  白痴总能让人上火
Yes, idiocy has a way of doing that.

229
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,280
好的  谢谢  有点激烈
Okay, thank you, little cordiality here.

230
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,330
请继续  莫雷洛先生
Continue, Mr. Morrello.

231
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,780
「美国法典」第18编第2339A条禁止任何人
18 U.S. Code 2339A prohibits anyone

232
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,550
向恐怖组织提供物质支持
from providing material support to terrorist organizations.

233
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,640
当皮科先生为已知恐怖分子实施手术时
When Dr. Picot operated on a known terrorist...

234
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,130
他并没有实施手术  法官阁下
He didn't operate, Your Honor.

235
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,150
他是通过视频电话辅助手术
He assisted in an operation over Skype.

236
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,420
不仅是辅助  他还督导手术
Not just assisted. He supervised.

237
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,210
他是经过训练的心脏病专家
He is a trained heart specialist,

238
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,710
全美只有三位  而他是其中一个
one of only three in America

239
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,120
可以实施那个手术的人
who could've performed that operation.

240
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,560
法官阁下  助理联邦检察官漏了一个关键词
Your Honor, the AUSA left one important word out of 18 U.S.C.

241
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,600
任何人不得"故意"向恐怖分子提供物质帮助
"No one may knowingly provide material support to a terrorist."

242
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,890
我们当事人不知道叙利亚的病人是谁
Our client had no idea who the patient was in Syria.

243
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,570
他只知道那是一个需要医疗救助的
All he knew was that he was a human being

244
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,500
活生生的人
in need of medical assistance.

245
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,030
我这有句话是皮科医生
I have a-a quote here from Dr. Picot

246
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,130
对无国界医生组织说的
to Medecins Sans Frontieres:

247
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,190
我给中南部的帮派成员和连环杀手
"I have operated on gang members in South Central

248
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,500
做了手术
and serial killers.

249
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,530
我要如何跟恐怖分子划清界限呢
How can I draw a line with terrorists?"

250
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,560
我明白了  助理联邦检察官是想
I see. So, the AUSA now wants to

251
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,140
因为我们当事人的思想而囚禁他
imprison our client for his thoughts,

252
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,000
-而不是因为他的行动  -我只是认为
- not his actions. - I just thought

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,200
法官阁下会喜欢这个上下文的语境
her Honor would enjoy a little context here.

254
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,840
{\an8}我们当事人过去所说的话与本案毫无关联
Our client's past statements have no bearing on this case. 

255
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,650
好了  好了
Okay. Okay.

256
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,390
我们不过在讨论审前保释  仅此而已
This is about a pretrial release, that's all.

257
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,600
不是最高法院  也不是海牙国际法庭
It's not the Supreme Court. It's not The Hague.

258
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,000
因此  我判决  被告缴纳两千美元假释金
Therefore, I rule: the defendant is ordered released

259
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,200
即可获得假释
on an unsecured bond of $2,000.

260
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,210
行政餐厅
An executive dining room.

261
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,550
我的天  你们手机塔的生意还真是好
My goodness, the cell tower business must be good.

262
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,810
你知道的  我们的合同都是你处理的
You should know, you're handling our contracts.

263
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,400
我们以前处理过
We were handling them.

264
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,540
今年好像有点耽误
There seems to be a holdup this year.

265
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,430
尝尝这个面包
Try this bread.

266
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,580
每天早晨现做的  我的办公室是就在楼上
They bake it every morning. My office is upstairs.

267
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,460
我整天都能闻到香味
I smell it all day.

268
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,640
说吧  罗恩
All right, come on, Ron,

269
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
什么情况  我们还没拿到律师费
what's going on? We haven't gotten our retainer.

270
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,070
我说了不算
It's not just up to me.

271
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,730
我们有董事会
I have a board.

272
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,550
每个人都有决策权
They all have a voice.

273
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,450
可我们签的是无招标合同  罗恩
But we're a no-bid contract, Ron.

274
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,090
我们提供服务所要缴纳的税款可减免两成
You get a tax credit for 20% of our work.

275
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,360
你是对我们的工作不满意吗
Are you unsatisfied with our work?

276
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,710
那是为什么
Then what?

277
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,300
事情有变化
Things have changed.

278
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,450
什么意思
What does that mean?

279
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,920
非得我一五一十说清楚吗
Do I really have to spell it out?

280
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,430
我觉得需要
I think you do.

281
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,560
新的政府
A new administration.

282
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,500
-新的总统  -但他们不会取消
- A new president. - But they're not pulling back

283
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,960
和少数族裔企业做生意而得到的税费减免
on tax credits for hiring minority-owned businesses.

284
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,040
对啊  但是你们并不是唯一的少数族裔企业
Yes, but you are not the only minority-owned business.

285
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,480
那我们说的是哪家呢
So who else are you talking to?

286
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,140
四点钟的时候回来
Look, come back in at 4:00.

287
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,580
跟董事会谈谈
Talk to the board.

288
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,190
亮出你们的底牌
Explain your bid.

289
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,400
我相信他们会听进去的
I'm sure they'll listen.

290
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,790
好的
Okay.

291
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,190
你们先走吧
Go ahead,

292
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,450
我坐下一趟
I'll take the next one.

293
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,800
是因为我反对特朗普的言论
It's what I said against Trump.

294
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,360
我在一次集会上说的
I spoke at a rally.

295
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,960
不  许多人都反对特朗普
Mm, no, a lot of folks spoke out against Trump. It's...

296
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,250
那是因为什么
Then what?

297
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,060
说啊
What?

298
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,620
因为安德鲁·哈特
It's Andrew Hart.

299
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,050
我以为他早就关门大吉了
I thought he went out of business.

300
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,050
他开了一家12人的律所  在黄金海岸那边
He runs a 12-man operation - on the Gold Coast. 

301
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,450
12人  他开什么玩笑
12 men? Is he fucking kidding?

302
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,560
我们有80名律师呢
We have 80 lawyers here.

303
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,670
是少数族裔企业吗
It's minority-owned?

304
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,620
是的  他们刚从华盛顿特区搬到这来
Yes. They just moved here from D.C.

305
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,990
那就是因为他们的政府背景关系了
So it's about their government connections?

306
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,920
要我猜的话
My guess?

307
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,570
不止这些
Something more.

308
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,670
比如呢
Like what?

309
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,150
安德鲁·哈特是少数的参与特朗普竞选的
Andrew Hart is one of the few African-American businessmen

310
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,200
美国黑人商人
who ran a Trump PAC.

311
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,510
所以我们就要因为没有迎合特朗普而破产了
So we're going bankrupt 'cause we didn't pander to Trump.

312
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,080
他的脉搏很微弱  医生
His pulse is weaker, doctor.

313
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,310
他的发烧已经控制住了
His fever has spiked.

314
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,360
我们给他静脉注射了
We gave him I.V. Fluids,

315
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
但是他的血压还是不停地降
but his blood pressure is falling anyway.

316
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,390
没关系的  尤瑟夫
Okay, it's okay, Yusuf.

317
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,600
告诉他给病人加大静脉注射
Tell him to give the patient more I.V. Fluid.

318
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,530
他必须要把切口重新打开
He's gonna have to reopen the incision.

319
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,770
会有些肿
It will be swollen.

320
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,680
好吧  等下  我要翻译一下
O-Okay, hold on. I need to translate.

321
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,340
等等   尤瑟夫  
Wait, h-hold on, Yusuf, 

322
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,800
照我说的做  完后打给我
call me back when you've done all that.

323
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,260
为什么
Why?

324
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,990
我不知道他们是怎么窃听到上次的视频电话
I don't know how they tapped the last Skype.

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,660
我得找个更安全的地方
I need to get to a more secure place.

326
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,130
-一会打给你  -等下  什么...
- I'll call you back. - Wait, what...

327
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,380
尤瑟夫  你在吗
Yusuf, are you there?

328
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,620
在  你在哪
Yes, where are you?

329
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,660
我在外面
I'm outside.

330
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,360
我可能会走动
I might be moving.

331
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,240
进行到哪一步了
Where are we?

332
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,060
病人已插管  胸腔打开了  医生
The patient is intubated and the chest is open, doctor.

333
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,360
现在怎么办
Now what should he do?

334
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,790
确保没有再出血
Uh... make sure there's no new bleeding.

335
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,820
可能心脏上有个我们没发现的伤口
Could be a laceration in the heart that we missed.

336
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,130
好吧  我们要非常小心  动作要慢
Okay, we're gonna take this nice and slowly.

337
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,090
医生
Doctor?

338
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,170
-等一下  -医生
- Yeah, one second. - Doctor.

339
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,040
好了  告诉他放下引流管
Okay, tell him to leave the drain,

340
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,510
用抗生素清洗心脏周围然后缝合
wash around the heart with antibiotics and close up.

341
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,850
没有时间了
There isn't much time.

342
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,580
打给别人  他还有六个小时
Call somebody else. He has six hours.

343
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,870
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

344
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,620
你所说的话都将成为呈堂...
Anything you say can and will be used against you...

345
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,380
你最近怎么样  爸
How've you been, dad?

346
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,520
抱歉  玛娅现在需要律师在场
Sorry, it's just important that Maia have her lawyer present.

347
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,110
好的

我很好  你呢
I'm good, and you?

349
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,570
你怎么样  玛娅
How are you, Maia?

350
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,030
就当我不存在
Just act like I'm not here.

351
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,970
我很好  也很好
I'm good. I'm good, too.

352
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,940
我们能有点私人空间吗  鲁珀特
Can we, uh, get a little space here, Rupert?

353
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,870
抱歉
Sorry.

354
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,470
作为你的律师  亨利  我不建议这样做
As your lawyer, Henry, I can't advise it.

355
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,590
我听说你找了个新工作
So I heard you got a new job.

356
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,910
是啊  挺好的  我很喜欢这份工作
Uh, yeah, yeah, it's good. I like it.

357
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,030
我知道你会的
Oh, I knew you would.

358
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,180
你妈告诉我你接了一个大案子
And Mom told me that you got a big case.

359
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,800
妈妈来过了吗
Mom was here?

360
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,050
是的  今早
This morning, yes.

361
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,220
我告诉了她你今天要来
I told her you'd be coming today.

362
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,850
她说了什么吗
Did she say anything?

363
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,800
什么事
About?

364
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,770
我不知道
I don't know.

365
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,610
-说了什么吗  -这个...
- Anything? - Well, uh,

366
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,450
就说你和艾米接到了骚扰电话
just that you and Amy are getting harassing calls.

367
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,970
还有你很喜欢新的律所
That you're enjoying this new law firm.

368
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,070
还有你很担心妈妈的癌症复发
And that you were worried about Mom's cancer scare.

369
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,710
提到贾克斯了吗
Anything about Jax?

370
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,850
我觉得我们不应该谈到这个话题
I really don't think we should go there.

371
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,020
没事  鲁珀特
It's okay, Rupert.

372
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,870
她就说他还在为这次庞氏骗局责怪我
Just that he still blames me for this Ponzi scheme.

373
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,430
-就这个吗  -是的
- That's it? - Yeah.

374
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,020
怎么了  还有什么
Why? What else?

375
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,610
你真...
Do you re...

376
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,460
你真的觉得妈妈在  帮助你吗
Do you really think that mom is... helping you?

377
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,820
帮我什么
Helping me with...?

378
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,420
她是支持你还是
Well, is she standing by you or, 

379
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,370
还是她站在贾克斯这边
you know, is she standing by... Jax?

380
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,770
为什么你妈要站在贾克斯那边
Why would mom stand by Jax?

381
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,220
我不知道
Well, I don't know.

382
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,810
你就没有什么担心的事吗
But is that something that worries you?

383
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,740
你有什么需要担心的事吗
Do you have any reason to be worried?

384
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,060
我们不能再谈下去了
We should end this.

385
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,370
好吧
Okay.

386
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,410
贾克斯的个人电脑
Jax's personal computer.

387
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,250
-看门狗...  -亨利  不行
- Watchdog... - Henry, no.

388
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,630
我们  我们走  走吧
Let's... mm. Let's go, come on.

389
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,700
不  亨利  不行
No, Henry, no.

390
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,880
-亨利  不  -走  走  我们走
- Henry, no! - Come on, come on, let's go.

391
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,110
谢谢
Thank you.

392
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,050
再见  爸
Good-bye, dad.

393
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,510
再见  亲爱的
Good-bye, sweetheart.

394
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,450
玛娅  他说了什么
Maia, what did he say?

395
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,100
玛娅  他说了什么
Maia, what?

396
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,010
没什么
Nothing.

397
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,330
他只说了  "我爱你"
He just said... "I love you."

398
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,590
得了吧
Oh, come on.

399
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,080
给我看看
All right, let me see.

400
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,290
不管他要你做什么  玛娅  你都不能做
Whatever he asked you to do, Maia, you can't do it.

401
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,780
你做的事不受保密特权保护
There's no privilege here.

402
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,580
配偶可以不出庭作证
A spouse can be prevented from testifying,

403
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,640
但你不行
but you can't.

404
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,990
我不明白
I don't understand.

405
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,620
我们搞的好像已经没戏了
We're acting like this is over.

406
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,250
他们在和我们玩硬的
They're just playing a little hardball with us.

407
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,540
所以我们把要价降低百分之十
So we lower our bid by ten percent.

408
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,780
问题是他们依靠政府给他们的发射塔的
The problem is they rely on the government for low lease rates

409
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,050
低租赁利率
for their cell towers.

410
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,980
他们不想惹恼特朗普政府
They don't want to piss off the Trump administration.

411
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,050
和我们打交道怎么会惹恼特朗普政府
Why would they piss off the Trump administration with us?

412
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,530
因为我们是我们...
Because we're us...

413
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,160
还有你们
...you guys.

414
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,890
和那些警察暴力执法案件有关
Because of all the police brutality cases.

415
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,640
那我们怎么办
So what do we do?

416
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,850
谁给特朗普投了票
Who voted for Trump?

417
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,890
我们就从事前限制这点下手
We argue prior restraint.

418
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,580
他们说他不能实施手术
They're saying he can't operate,

419
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,930
即使他们没有证明... 
even before they prove...

420
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,560
我们不必如此
We don't have to go there.

421
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,900
他们还没提供任何能证明病人身份的证据
They haven't presented evidence on the patient's identity yet.

422
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,570
那我们就得做两手准备
Okay, then we should argue both.

423
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,480
卢卡  你只是次席律师
Lucca, you're second chair.

424
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,740
是没错  但我知道怎么对付这家伙
Yes, but I know how to go after this guy.

425
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,950
他不是问题关键  关键是法律
He is not the problem; the problem is the law.

426
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,200
两者皆是
It's both.

427
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,480
好吧  你先上
Okay, you go first.

428
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,480
为什么
Why?

429
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,450
你能分散他的注意力
You distract him.

430
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,090
皮科医生试图对同一个恐怖分子指导二次手术
Dr. Picot attempted a second operation on the same terrorist.

431
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,370
-逮捕他属于事前限制  -非得这样吗
- Arresting him again is prior restraint. - Seriously?

432
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,630
我能把话说完吗  法官阁下
May I finish, Your Honor? 

433
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,780
你俩互相认识吗
Do you two know each other?

434
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,730
法官阁下  被告已不能以不知情做为辩护点了
Your Honor, the defendant can no longer argue ignorance.

435
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,770
他现在知道该病人就是恐怖分子
He knows the patient is a terrorist now.

436
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,420
他怎么知道的
How does he know that?

437
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,750
-是啊  怎么知道的  -奎因女士
- Yeah, how? - Ms. Quinn.

438
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,580
因为三小时前
He knows because he was here

439
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,920
我们就此事辩论时他在场
three hours ago when we argued he was a terrorist.

440
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,600
但有何依据呢  我们没看到任何证据
But with what evidence? We didn't hear any evidence.

441
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,010
-证据属于机密  -还真是个好理由
- That evidence is confidential. - And here we go.

442
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,410
不幸的是国家的敌人依旧存在
Yes, unfortunately, this country still has enemies.

443
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,970
所以抱歉造成你的不便了  奎因女士
Sorry to inconvenience you, Ms. Quinn.

444
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,970
他才19岁
He's 19 years old.

445
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,910
不可能是恐怖分子
He's not a terrorist. 

446
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,470
一处巴格达市场就是被一个15岁小子炸毁的
A Baghdad market was just blown up by a 15-year-old.

447
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,090
恐怖主义可不分年龄大小  先生
Terrorism doesn't honor age, sir.

448
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,260
皮科医生  这个在叙利亚的年轻人还能撑多久
Dr. Picot, how long does this young man in Syria have to live?

449
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,960
四个小时
Four hours.

450
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,820
那我得在五点前结束这个案子
So I have until 5:00 to decide this case. 

451
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,360
那好
All right, then.

452
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,400
我要听取是否批准皮科医生保释的证据
I will hear evidence on Dr. Picot's pretrial release.

453
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,090
您已经准许他保释了
You have already granted his release.

454
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,600
法官阁下  这次手术不能进行
Your Honor, this operation cannot happen.

455
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,990
停  停  停
No, no, no, no, no, no.

456
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,690
你们只有三个半小时来展示证据
You have three and a half hours to present evidence.

457
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,820
所以别再吵了  直接上证据
Stop arguing and get me the evidence.

458
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,150
{\an8}联邦法庭

459
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,190
梅丽莎  有个紧急情况
Marissa, it's an emergency.

460
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,700
我需要一名医师资格委员会成员出庭作证
I need a witness from the Medical Licensing Board right now.

461
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,150
好  你需要这位证人做什么准备
Yeah, where do you want him or her, this witness?

462
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,530
行不用说了  我马上办
Okay, I'm on it, I'm on it.

463
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,290
你在找什么
W-What do you need?

464
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,770
调查员
The investigator.

465
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,010
我不知道是谁
Oh, I don't know who that is.

466
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,760
他大概有这么高  黑人
He's about this tall, black.

467
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,410
这等于白说对吧
That's not very helpful, is it?

468
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,400
那什么  我叫梅丽莎
I'm Marissa, by the way.

469
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,090
-玛娅  -我的座位在那边
- Maia. - I work over there.

470
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,670
我知道  很高兴认识你
No, I know. Nice to meet you.

471
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,430
我给戴安干活  不过她不在的时候
I work for Diane, but when she's out,

472
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,860
如果你有需要可以随时找我
tell me if you need anything.

473
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,720
下午四点你有事吗
What are you doing at 4:00?

474
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,180
你给他投了票也没关系
It's okay if you voted for him.

475
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,780
我们只是需要一个人去竞标
We just need someone for a bid.

476
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,380
不好意思  打扰一下
Sorry, sorry, hi.

477
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,410
能借一步说话吗
Do you have a minute?

478
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,820
怎么了
Why?

479
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,010
你说让我碰到
You wanted me to tell you

480
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,830
需要调查的事情时就找你
when I was needed to do something investigative.

481
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,250
刚才正好来了件这样的事
I just was needed to do something investigative.

482
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,390
天哪  我们有80名律师和50名职工
Wow, we have 80 lawyers and 50 staff

483
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,100
居然连一个给特朗普投票的都没有
and not a single one voted for Trump?

484
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,920
或者说没有一个愿意承认的
Or not a single one wanted to admit it.

485
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,610
干脆我撒谎说我给他投了好了
Maybe I'll just lie, say I voted for him.

486
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,780
芭芭拉  你有空吗
Barbara, have you got a moment?

487
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,140
你想说什么
What's on your mind?

488
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,670
不会有任何影响的  对吧
There won't be any repercussions, right?

489
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,480
真的假的
Seriously?

490
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,750
完蛋了
Oh, my God.

491
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,450
等等  你...
Wait. You...

492
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,030
给特朗普投了票
voted for Trump?

493
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,100
很好
Good.

494
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,560
那代表人选就是你了
Then you will pitch for us.

495
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,460
我讨厌这个
Oh, I hate this.

496
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,790
我懂  但这是为了律所
I know, but it's for the firm.

497
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,300
那个  我...
Look, I, uh...

498
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,400
我不会被排挤的  对吧
I don't get ostracized, right?

499
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,170
我不会被孤立吧
I-I don't get isolated?

500
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,450
听着  坎耶也投给特朗普了
Look, Kanye voted for Trump.

501
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,950
{\an8}坎耶：美国说唱歌手

502
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,050
不  他没有
No, he didn't.

503
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,160
他只说过如果投票的话他会投给他
He said he would've if he did vote.

504
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,170
对
Right.

505
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,010
除了我和阿德里安不会有其他人知道
Well, no one's gonna know but Adrian and myself.

506
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,790
真的吗
Really?

507
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,940
他有说原因吗
Did he say why?

508
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,520
因为他是保守派吧
Conservative politics.

509
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,160
好吧
Ah. Well,

510
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,700
坎耶也投给特朗普了
Kanye voted for Trump.

511
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,960
不  只是他如果真去投票的话  就会投他
No, he didn't, but he would have - if he had voted. 

512
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,860
律所代言人找到了
We have our spokesperson.

513
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,500
听着
Listen,

514
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,090
我答应他  他在这儿不会遭到排挤
I promised him he would not be ostracized here.

515
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,040
那是当然
Of course not.

516
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,520
麦克  来个八盎司汉堡  多加洋葱
Mike, an eight ounce, extra onions.

517
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,320
我马上要去法院
I'm headed to court.

518
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,440
你还有多少时间
How much time you got?

519
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,780
十分钟
Ten minutes.

520
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,940
这时间太紧了
That's cutting it close.

521
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,000
吃吧  这半个给你
Here, have half.

522
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,820
不了  没事
No, I'm fine.

523
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,680
法官说三点开庭  你肯定来不及的
Judge said 3:00. You're not gonna make it in time.

524
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,530
他说的没错  我需要12分钟来做汉堡
He's right. I need 12 minutes.

525
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,930
吃吧
Go ahead.

526
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,080
我喜欢多加洋葱和胡椒
I like extra onions, peppers.

527
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,790
如你所需
Done.

528
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,380
你要输了
You're losing.

529
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,710
这案子我稳操胜券
This one's a slam dunk.

530
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,560
很好
Good.

531
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,110
我就喜欢帮助男人解决他们自视甚高的问题
I like helping men with their self-esteem issues.

532
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,250
是位好律师吗
Good lawyer?

533
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,650
很有天赋
Very talented.

534
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,550
那笑容能让你走多远呢
So how far does a smile get you?

535
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,690
那个
The...

536
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,650
那个坏小子汤姆·克鲁斯式的笑容
The bad boy Tom Cruise smiles.

537
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,430
法官会为之疯狂吗
Do the judges go wild for it?

538
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,490
靠那个还有优秀的庭上辩论
That and a good argument.

539
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,420
不
No. 

540
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,450
我觉得你一直在依靠你那点都市型男魅力
I think you've always relied on the cute little metrosexual thing.

541
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,710
那种"天呐  从事法律只是我误打误撞"的
The, "Oh, my God, the law is just something I stumbled into," 

542
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,010
傻笑
shit-eating grin.

543
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,750
真是敏锐的感知力
Wow, the powers of perception.

544
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,590
谢谢
Thanks.

545
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,850
不管谁赢了都要请对方喝一杯
Whoever wins buys the other a drink.

546
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,970
你难道
Won't you be busy...

547
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,400
不用跟你那位金发小律师忙点什么吗
with your good blonde lawyer there?

548
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,440
我可以挤出时间来
Oh, I'll make time.

549
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,820
让我考虑一下
Let me think about it.

550
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,200
谢谢你的汉堡
Thanks for the burger.

551
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,430
这是在小题大做  法官阁下
This is melodrama, Your Honor. 

552
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,040
为什么是小题大做
Why is it melodrama?

553
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,720
如果这个男人得不到他所需的医疗救助
If this man does not get the help he needs,

554
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,710
他会死的
he will die.

555
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,880
-我的上帝啊  -可以称得上谋杀了
- Oh, my God. - That is an assassination attempt!

556
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,230
我们是在阻止他医治一位恐怖分子
We're preventing him from making a terrorist well.

557
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,850
仅此而已  这是一位
That's all. This is a terrorist

558
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,330
可能会导致成千上万人死亡的恐怖分子
who could be responsible for the death of thousands. 

559
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,590
法官阁下  我们有一位证人要出庭作证
Your Honor, we have a witness.

560
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,160
感谢上帝  快让她赶紧宣誓上庭
Thank God. Let's swear someone in, please.

561
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,460
太感谢你了
Thank you so much.

562
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,370
其实  不是我的功劳  是
Actually, it wasn't me, it was...

563
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,470
好吧
Okay.

564
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,090
我叫玛拉·库尔卡尼
Mala Kulkarni.

565
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,700
我是伊利诺伊州医师资格委员会的主席
I am president of the Medical Licensing Board of Illinois.

566
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,360
你能告诉我们这是什么吗
And can you tell the court what this is?

567
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,670
这是伊利诺伊州法律汇编中
It is the section of the Illinois Compiled Statutes 

568
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,910
关于医生违纪处分的章节
that deals with disciplinary actions against doctors.

569
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,340
在吊销行医执照的处罚理由列表中
And under the list of grounds for revoking a medical license,

570
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,340
你能读一下第16条吗
could you read number 16?

571
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,020
"放弃病人"
"Abandonment of a patient."

572
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,040
能解释下是什么意思吗
And what does that mean?

573
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,080
一旦一位医生同意去医治一位病人
Once a doctor has agreed to care for a patient,

574
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,990
他或者她就必须负责到底
he or she must follow through,

575
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,240
除非他能找到一位适格的替代者
unless he can find an adequate substitute.

576
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,030
如果他不能做到这一点呢
And if he doesn't?

577
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,380
他会失去他的行医执照
He loses his license.

578
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,140
法官阁下  控方正把皮科医生
Your Honor, the State is putting Dr. Picot

579
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,670
置于一个进退两难的境地
in an untenable position.

580
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,400
如果他不许进行这台手术
If he doesn't continue this operation,

581
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,700
他会失去他的行医执照
he will lose his license.

582
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,550
我们有一位反驳证人  法官阁下
We have a rebuttal witness, Your Honor.

583
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,800
我是斯宾塞·玛拉上校
Colonel Spencer Mara.

584
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,850
我管理华盛顿州路易斯麦科得联合基地的
I command Madigan Army Medical Center,

585
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,970
麦迪根陆军医疗中心
out of Lewis-McChord, Washington.

586
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,820
玛拉医生  你对战斗中医治伤员的情况
Dr. Mara, are you familiar with treating patients

587
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,290
-熟悉吗  -很熟悉
- during combat conditions? - I am.

588
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,720
一旦你接手一位病人
And once you start treating a patient,

589
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,560
你总能负责到底吗
do you always stay with them until the end?

590
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,780
当然会尽量
You try, obviously.

591
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,440
但有时候这么做并不安全
But sometimes it's not safe.

592
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,710
有时候别的地方需求更高
Sometimes you are needed somewhere else urgently.

593
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,190
你不会因此失去行医执照  对吗
You wouldn't expect to lose your license over it, would you? 

594
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,510
不会  考虑到战场的特殊情况
No. Not given battlefield conditions.

595
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,380
我问完了
Your witness.

596
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,060
你应该知道  玛拉医生
Uh, you're aware, Dr. Mara,

597
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,520
日内瓦公约要求为敌方作战人员
that the Geneva Convention requires the proper care

598
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,160
提供适当的照顾和治疗对吗
and treatment of enemy fighters?

599
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,790
我知道
I am aware.

600
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,090
根据那些条款  皮科医生难道不会被要求
By those rules, wouldn't Dr. Picot be required

601
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,740
-去医治他的病人吗  -日内瓦公约
- to treat his patient? - The Geneva Convention

602
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,650
只适用于国与国之间武装冲突的情况
only applies to cases involving enemy conflict between states.

603
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,530
我问的不是这个问题
That's not my question.

604
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,370
反对  法官阁下
Uh, objection, Your Honor.

605
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,020
证人应该被允许自由回答问题
The witness should be allowed to answer.

606
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,210
同意  请继续
Agreed. Go ahead.

607
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,070
现在这个情况并不属于国与国之间的武装冲突
This is not an armed conflict between states.

608
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,610
这位病人是一位伊斯兰国战士
The patient is an ISIS fighter

609
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,920
因此他是一位敌方作战人员
and therefore he is an enemy combatant.

610
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,690
了解了
I see.

611
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,520
所以问题出在这位病人是伊斯兰国战士上吗
So this is different because the patient is an ISIS fighter?

612
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,430
没错
Exactly.

613
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:25,910
你的意思是不是  玛拉医生
Don't you mean by that, Dr. Mara...

614
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,060
我觉得医生可以表达自己的意思  律师
I think the doctor can speak for himself, Counselor.

615
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,270
你是如何得知这位病人是一位伊斯兰国战士的
How do you know the patient is an ISIS fighter?

616
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,370
医生
Doctor?

617
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,740
我  我可能是口误了
I... I may have misspoke.

618
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,020
但是你知道患者是伊斯兰国战士
But you know the patient is an ISIS fighter?

619
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,750
请回答问题  医生
Doctor, answer the question.

620
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,940
是的
I do.

621
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,330
那你怎么知道他是伊斯兰国战士的
And how do you know the patient is an ISIS fighter?

622
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,890
助理联邦检察官说的
From the AUSA.

623
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,810
法官阁下
Your Honor,

624
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:49,890
政府的证人刚刚
the government's witness

625
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,960
揭露了病人的身份
just opened the door to the patient's identity.

626
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,560
伊斯兰国只是一个概称  法官阁下
ISIS is a generic term, Your Honor.

627
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,870
不是的  且控方证人刚刚也
No, it is not. And the prosecution's witness

628
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,990
争辩说他是伊斯兰国成员
has just argued that he's a member of ISIS.

629
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,780
我们需要弄清楚他是怎么知道的
We need to be shown how he knows this.

630
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,620
她说得没错  助理联邦检察官先生  
She got you there, Mr. AUSA.

631
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,390
信息得共享了  他是谁
The kimono is opened. Who is he?

632
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,120
我们需要几小时去收集这些信息
we'll-we'll need a few hours to gather this information.

633
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,890
不行不行
No, no, no.

634
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,200
皮科医生的患者两小时后就要死了  他是谁
Dr. Picot's patient will be dead in two hours. Who is he?

635
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,050
他是塔里克.阿布拉菲亚
He is Tariq Aboulafia.

636
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,800
谢谢  是叙利亚公民吗
Thank you. A citizen of Syria?

637
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,800
不
No.

638
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,350
是美国公民
The United States.

639
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,320
我还在想你会不会来
I was wondering if you'd ever come by.

640
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,850
我这不就来了
Here I am.

641
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,290
你上次来是什么时候
When was the last time you were here?

642
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,040
圣诞节
Uh, Christmas.

643
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,780
对  点了巧克力糖衣草莓
Oh, that's right. Chocolate-covered strawberries.

644
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,080
要点什么呢  玛娅
What can I get you, Maia?

645
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,570
答案
Answers.

646
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,510
我想的是啤酒之类的
Well, I was thinking more a beer,

647
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,380
不过要答案也可以 
but I could probably manage a few of those, too.

648
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,000
你爸爸怎么说
What'd your dad say?

649
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,950
庞氏骗局责任在你
You're responsible for the Ponzi scheme.

650
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,020
他发现了  因此你才去联调局嫁祸他
He caught you, that's why you went to the feds and blamed him.

651
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,030
而他和丽诺只是无辜受害者
And he and Lenore were just unsuspecting victims...

652
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,270
这怎么不会是真相呢
How's that not the truth?

653
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,560
你知道真相的  玛娅
You know the truth, Maia.

654
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,700
这些年你一直看着你父母的作为
You watched your parents all those years.

655
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,810
你爸爸想要做别人眼中的金融天才
Your dad wanted to be seen as some genius of finance.

656
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,900
「财富」杂志的那些文章
Those articles in Fortune?

657
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,810
那些不是我要的  是他
I never wanted them, he did.

658
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,880
他最不想承认的事情就是所有成就都是运气
The last thing he wanted to admit was it was all luck.

659
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,780
他在股票投资上并无天分
He was no genius at stocks.

660
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,920
你扔个飞镖中靶概率估计都比他的投资好
You throw a dart at a board, it'd be more accurate.

661
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,110
所以当泡沫破裂的时候
So when the bubble hit,

662
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,170
他仍旧对外宣传他还在获利
he kept sending out statements that he was still winning.

663
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,680
这才是关于你爸爸的真相
That's the real truth about your dad.

664
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,040
他不是想诈骗别人的钱财
He didn't want to steal people's money.

665
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,390
他只是想被看作成功者
He just wanted to be seen as a winner.

666
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,460
你为什么要和我妈搞在一起
Why are you sleeping with my mom?

667
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,540
我没有
I'm not sleeping with your mom.

668
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,520
你去死吧
Fuck you.

669
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,350
去接电话吧  我不会跑的
Go ahead. I'm not going anywhere.

抱歉我说了两次"有关"

680
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,680
我的案件  你把我搞糊涂了
Uh, my suit? I'm confused.

681

你说你给他投票了

因为我不是能因此被定义的

那就说说我们律所能代表多样化观点的理由

741
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,830

塔里克在叙利亚  他需要你的帮助

这是我儿子塔里克  他不是恐怖分子
This is my son, Tariq. He is not a terrorist.

746
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,020
法官阁下  这是病人的妈妈

747
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,940
可以让我们说完吗

他  他想劝他哥哥回家

艾马尔
Aimar.

754
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,510
是艾马尔·阿布拉菲亚吗
And this would be Aimar Aboulafia, 

755
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,540
那个美国通缉要犯名单中的恐怖分子
a terrorist on America's Most Wanted list?

756
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,670
所以  塔里克的哥哥  艾马尔
So Tariq's brother, Aimar,

757
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,120
才是美国正在通缉的恐怖分子
would seem to be the terrorist the U.S. is after,

758
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,950
而不是塔里克
not Tariq?

759
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,640
塔里克飞往叙利亚去阻止他
Tariq flew to Syria to try to stop him.

760
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,050
他不是恐怖分子

00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,600
他是个学生  学化学专业
He is a student here. He is studying chemistry.

762
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,770
他是带着机票飞往叙利亚的吗

763
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,850
是的  为了把艾马尔带回家
Yes! To bring him home.

764
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,870
法官阁下  您应该允许皮科医生

765
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,670
继续给塔里克手术  因为他救的人

莫雷洛先生  有什么事吗

769
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,690
是的  法官阁下  请稍等
Yes, Your Honor. One second, please.

770
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,470
「美国法典」第2339A条禁止任何人
U.S. Code 2339A prohibits anyone from knowingly 

771
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,070
有意为恐怖分子或恐怖组织
providing material support of any kind

772
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,630
提供任何形式的实质帮助
to a terrorist or terrorist organization.

773
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,680
不幸的是  根据阿布拉菲亚夫人的供述
Unfortunately, by Ms. Aboulafia's admission,

774
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,380
塔里克恰恰做了这样的事
that is exactly what Tariq did.

775
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,310
-什么  法官阁下  -法官阁下
- What? Your Honor... - Your Honor. 

776
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,550
这垂死挣扎真让我大开眼界
This is a new level of desperation.

777
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,520
你说的实质帮助是什么呢
What material support are we talking about here?

778
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,430
机票
The airplane tickets.

779
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,040
他想把他哥哥带回家

780
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,840
没错  这就是提供了实质帮助
Yes, which is supplying material support.

781
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,240
上帝啊  这真是令人惊叹的诡辩
Oh, my God, the sophistry here is amazing.

782
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,980
法官阁下
Your Honor,

783
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,060
第2339A条的规定是意图中立的
Code 2339A is content neutral.

784
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,750
事实上  最高法院在
In fact, the Supreme Court decision

785
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,430
霍尔德诉人道主义法计划案的判决中
in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project made it very clear

786
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,930
明确表示在人道主义法计划中
that the good intentions of the Law Project

787
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,390
善意动机并不能否定其行为的有罪性
made no difference as to their culpability.

788
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:43,150
重要的是实质帮助本身
All that mattered is the material support itself.

789
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,710
这些机票明显是实质帮助
These airline tickets are clearly material support.

790
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,080
很可惜  我认同
Unfortunately, I agree.

791
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,620
-法官阁下  -这不是
- Your Honor. - This is not...

不
No, no.

在精神上我站在你这一边
I may agree with you on the spirit,

794
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,200
但在法律意义上则不然
but not the letter of the law.

795
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,200
霍尔德诉人道主义法计划案是最高法院判例
Holder v. HLP is a Supreme Court precedent,

796
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,140
本法庭必须遵守其判决
and that is how this court rules,

797
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,520
不论我的裁决对那叙利亚的可怜人意味着什么
despite what my verdict means for the poor man in Syria.

798
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,370
被告应被拘留直至审判开始
The defendant is hereby detained until trial.

799
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
是的  我们需要皮科医生
Y-Yes, we need Dr. Picot.

800
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,070
不幸的是  他被羁留了  尤瑟夫
Unfortunately, he's being held, Yusuf.

病人情况不太好
The patient is not doing well.

802
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,570
我知道  我们还在研究策略
I know, we're still working on options.

803
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,250
发生什么事了
What's going on?

804
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,850
有个人
There is someone here.

805
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,400
他在威胁医护人员
He is threatening the staff.

806
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,790
怎么威胁的
Threatening with what?

807

如果我们不做手术  他就会杀人
Unless we operate, he will kill someone.

808
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,930
尤瑟夫  你能把手机朝向他吗
Uh, Yusuf, can you turn the iPhone toward him?

809
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:54,510
那个威胁人的人
The threatening man?

810
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,300
-为什么  -拜托了  把手机朝向他
- Why? - Please. Can you turn the iPhone?

811
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,520
你在干什么
What are you doing?

812
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,870
这个男人
That man right there.

813
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,740
是病人的哥哥  艾马尔
That's the patient's brother, Aimar.

814
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,050
他在威胁医护人员
He's threatening the medical staff. 

815
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,600
如果病人死了  他会杀了他们
If the patient dies, he will kill them. 

816
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,810
法官阁下  法庭必须考虑到损害衡量
Your Honor, this court must consider the balance of hardships.

817
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,150
塔里克·阿布拉菲亚给一个生命垂危的
The risk of Tariq Aboulafia giving a plane ticket

818
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,060
恐怖分子飞机票属于长远的低风险

819
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,340
而整个医疗团队被一名情绪激动的
The risk of an entire medical staff being slaughtered

820
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,120
恐怖分子所残杀属于迫切的高风险

821
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,870
而损害衡量要求
The balance of the hardships demand

822
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,450
手术必须继续进行
that this surgery proceed.

823
