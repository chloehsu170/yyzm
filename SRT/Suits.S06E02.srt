{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前请提要

21
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,480
-罗伯特・赞恩向你发出了邀请  -是的
- Robert Zane made you an offer. - He did.

22
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,750
你求我再给你一次机会
You begged me for a second chance.

23
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,520
现在他是要利用你摧毁我们
And now he's using you to destroy us.

24
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,230
你步伐轻盈地走进来以为这会跟
You waltzed in here thinking this was gonna be

25
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,630
监狱电影的桥段一样  然而现实并非如此
like some prison movie, but it's not.

26
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,750
-这里就是监狱  -欢迎来到丹伯里
- It's just prison. - Welcome to Danbury.

27
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,610
-迈克・罗斯  -弗兰克・加洛
- Mike Ross. - Frank Gallo.

28
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,260
我们因为迈克・罗斯接触过的所有案子被告了
We're being sued for every case Mike Ross has ever touched.

29
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,460
你不想承认这整件事都是
You won't admit this whole thing is your fault

30
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,970
-因你的错而起  -我的错吗
- in the first place. - My fault?

31
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,720
要不是我把迈克招进来  你到现在
If I hadn't brought Mike in, you'd still be here

32
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,110
还只能跟个初级合伙人一样
sniveling around like a Goddamn junior partner.

33
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,080
你的未婚妻  你想打给她吗
Your fiancé, you want to call her?

34
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,770
也许我该给瑞秋发条短信
Maybe I'll just send Rachel a text.

35
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,550
我们得在明天之前转移
We need to move the money that we have

36
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,040
所有账户里的钱
in every account by tomorrow.

37
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,030
我们用不着转移
We don't need to move it.

38
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,910
我们得利用它们  和解公司所面临的集体诉讼
We can use their buy-ins to settle the class-action lawsuits.

39
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,080
好了  走吧
All right, let's go.

40
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,000
这就是我的牢房  你们给我的牢房
I'm in the right cell. I'm in the one you gave me.

41
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
是啊  但这不是他们给我的房间
Yeah, but this isn't the one they gave me.

42
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,330
你说你本来你可以让另一个人进来的
You said you could've turned on a guy to get out of here,

43
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,430
但是你没有  因为你觉得自己亏欠他
but you didn't because you owe him.

44
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,780
好吧  我也欠那个狗娘养的
Well, I owe that son of a bitch too.

45
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,990
-混蛋  -放松  迈克
- You son of a bitch. - Take it easy, Mike.

46
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,470
记得我知道你的一切
And remember, I know about you.

47
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,100
还有你女朋友的电话号码
And I got your little girlfriend's number right here.

48
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,440
你一直盯着表看
You keep watching that clock,

49
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,340
那你的两年会很漫长
it's gonna be a long two years.

50
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,060
不管你相不相信  我也曾经像你这样
Believe it or not, I've been where you are right now.

51
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,590
你整晚都在想着如何
You've been thinking about how to get back

52
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,010
能报复那个混蛋
at that son of a bitch all night.

53
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,410
向他的燕麦粥吐口水
Spit in his oatmeal.

54
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,760
在他的枕头上拉屎
Shit on his pillow.

55
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,790
不论你有什么想法  我的建议就是不要做
Whatever it is, my advice to you is don't do it.

56
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,600
我不需要你的建议
I don't need any advice from you.

57
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,110
-你说什么  -就是你
- Excuse me? - You're the one

58
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,060
让我和那个神经病待在一起的
that left me alone with that psychopath in the first place.

59
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,120
现在我明白你为什么
Now I get why you haven't

60
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,560
整晚都没有跟我讲话了
said a word to me since last night.

61
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,710
发生了这种事
How the hell did you think I'd react

62
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,700
-你认为我该有什么反应  -听着  伙计
- after something like that? - Hey, listen, man.

63
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,950
我跟你没有任何过节
I don't have anything against you,

64
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,220
但我们之间也没有任何交情
but I sure as hell don't have anything for you.

65
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,400
我当然不会为了一个陌生人
And I'm not gonna cause trouble with a guy like that

66
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,880
去招惹那样一个人  所以如果他想
for someone I've never even met, so if he wants me

67
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,400
让我换几个小时的房间  那我就换
to switch for a few hours, I'm switching.

68
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,980
才不管我会发生什么呢  是吧
To hell with what happens to me, right?

69
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,410
-我可没这么说  -你只是这么做了
- Hey, I didn't say that. - No, you just did it.

70
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,380
唐娜  你来干什么
Donna, what are you doing here?

71
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,920
我来送礼物的
I come bearing gifts.

72
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,960
非常感谢  但你不用特地跑来这里看我
That's really nice, but you don't have to come over here

73
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,560
我没事
to check on me. I'm fine.

74
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,060
你可是穿着你未婚夫的衬衫在说这些话
Says the girl in her fiancé's shirt.

75
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,040
听着  我知道这有点俗气
Look, I know it's cheesy.

76
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,670
瑞秋  你想感受到他就在你身边
Rachel, you wanted to feel him next to you.

77
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,050
这并不俗气
It's not cheesy.

78
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,690
谢谢  唐娜
Thanks, Donna.

79
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,420
你确实该谢谢我
Well, you do owe me a thank you,

80
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,350
但不是因为这件事
but it's not for that.

81
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,980
因为过几个小时
Because in a couple of hours it's going to be more

82
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,710
就不止他的衬衫围绕着你了
than his shirt wrapped around you.

83
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,380
你是说你把我加到探访名单了
Are you saying that you got me on the visitor's list,

84
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,330
但他们说如果不是家属
because they said that if I'm not family--

85
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,260
我不在乎他们怎么说  你就是他的家属
I don't care what they said. You're his family.

86
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,720
你也是我的家人  昨晚不把你弄到名单上
And you're my family, and I wasn't going to sleep last night

87
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,550
我是睡不着的
until I got you on that list.

88
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,700
我不知道该说什么好了
I-I don't know what to say.

89
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,980
说"谢谢你  唐娜"  然后去看他
Say, "Thank you, Donna," and get your ass up there.

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
你手里拿着什么呢  猛男
What you got in your hand there, tiger?

91
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,460
深度烘焙  加奶油  不加糖
Dark roast, splash of cream, no sugar.

92
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,980
为什么对我这么好
And to what do I owe the honor?

93
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,430
我今早在想你把我
I was thinking this morning about the day

94
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,840
从收发室选出来的那天
you picked me out of the mailroom

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,140
-到现在已经发生了多少事  -可笑的是
- and how far we've come. - You know, it's funny.

96
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,970
我今早在想的是到现在我们已经堕落了多深
I was thinking this morning about how far we've fallen.

97
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,620
那就让我们结束这些诉讼吧
Then let's go put these lawsuits to bed.

98
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,020
不好意思  警官
Excuse me, Officer?

99
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,110
我知道电话十点后才能用
I know the phones don't open until 10:00,

100
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,460
但我想问一下是否能
but I was wondering if it's possible for me

101
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,360
让我现在打个电话
to make a phone call?

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,970
站回队里  吃你的早餐
Get back in line and eat your breakfast.

103
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,410
求你了  我这么说的唯一原因
Please. The only reason I'm asking

104
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,540
是有紧急事件  我只需要
is 'cause it's an emergency. I just need a little--

105
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,960
怎么了  你着火了吗
What, are you on fire?

106
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,950
你的腿摔折了
Your leg broken?

107
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,770
因为在我看来你是想打电话给外面的人
'Cause it looks to me like you're trying to call

108
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,170
说一些你在这里面的事情
someone out there about something that happened in here.

109
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,340
你不明白  好吧  我的未婚妻
You don't understand, all right, my fiancé is--

110
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,950
不  是你不明白
No, you don't understand.

111
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,510
除非是有炸弹要爆炸了
Unless there's a bomb headed for us,

112
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,950
外面的任何事情都跟
nothing that happens out there has anything to do

113
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,790
这里面的事无关了  明白了吗
with what happens in here. You got that?

114
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,560
好的  明白了
Yeah, got it.

115
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,540
我昨晚走的很匆忙
Hey, I left in such a hurry last night,

116
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,050
没来得及跟你道别
didn't get a chance to say good-bye.

117
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,390
那我现在说
Well, I'll say it now.

118
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,500
好好生活  别招惹我
Have a nice life. Leave me alone.

119
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,290
你不想看看你未婚妻
Don't you want to see a copy of the pictures

120
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,330
昨晚给我发的照片吗
your fiancé sent me last night?

121
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,150
你放屁  她没给你发任何东西
That's bullshit. She didn't send you anything.

122
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,950
你说对了  她没给我发
You're right, she didn't.

123
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,290
她是发给你的
She sent 'em to you.

124
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,190
我是说  本来就是你先开始的
I mean, you're the one who started it all,

125
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,970
告诉她你有多想她
telling her how much you missed her.

126
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,610
你认为在那之后我让她
How hard do you think it was for me to get her

127
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,060
给我发张性感照片能有多难
to send a sexy picture to you after that?

128
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,500
好像现在的孩子们管那叫自拍
I think that kids today call it a selfie.

129
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,580
她不可能给你发那种照片
There's no way she sent you a picture like that.

130
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,890
你说对了  并不性感
You're right, it wasn't sexy.

131
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,870
我做了什么呢  我把她的脸
But what I did, I photoshopped her face

132
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,420
拼接到了一个性感身体上
onto a body that is.

133
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,830
我弄得可好了
I did such a good job,

134
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,030
这里的人都发现不了
no one in here is ever gonna notice.

135
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,060
是啊  我还弄了好多份
Yeah. I made copies.

136
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,790
这里的每个人都有一份
One for each guy in the joint.

137
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,710
一般这种情况我都是要收费的
Usually, a situation like this, I would charge a fortune.

138
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,660
但今天我心情好
But today, I'm feeling so generous

139
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,510
我打算免费发给他们
I'm going to give them away for free.

140
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,600
别纠缠他了  加洛
Get off him, Gallo!

141
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,900
什么  我什么都没做  是他攻击我
What? I didn't do shit! He attacked me!

142
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,010
那是放屁
That is bullshit!

143
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,600
我之前就是想和你说就是这个人
I tried to tell you that's the guy.

144
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,780
我不在乎你之前想干什么
I don't care what you tried to do.

145
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,580
你不是说有紧急情况嘛  现在是有了
You wanted an emergency, now you got it.

146
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,200
-把他俩都带出去  -什么
- Get 'em both out of here. - What?

147
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,750
早上好  皮尔逊女士  斯佩克特先生
Good morning, Ms. Pearson, Mr. Specter,

148
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,780
两位需要热毛巾吗
can I offer either of you a hot towel?

149
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,040
小姐  能否麻烦你告诉我是谁雇的你
Miss, would you mind telling me who hired you?

150
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,270
我觉得我俩都心知肚明
I think we both know who hired her.

151
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,340
你小子在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

152
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,170
-我在复印  -滚犊子
- I'm making copies. - Goddamn it.

153
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,170
我们付你350一小时不是请你来复印的
We don't bill you out at 350 an hour to make copies.

154
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,720
快给我滚回去工作
Now get your ass back to work.

155
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,280
那份动议可不会自己起草好
That motion isn't going to file itself.

156
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,440
路易  你干了什么
Louis, what the hell did you do?

157
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,070
什么  你在说什么
What? What are you talking about?

158
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,920
我们没钱雇律师
We don't have the money to hire associates,

159
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,100
律师助理  或者客服人员
paralegals, and support staff.

160
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,160
我知道
I know that.

161
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,170
我不是白痴  他们不是客服人员
I'm not an idiot, they're not support staff.

162
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,340
那他们是什么人
Who the hell are they?

163
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,520
他们是临时演员
They're movie extras.

164
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,390
你昨晚飞了多少叶子
How much weed did you smoke last night?

165
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,320
我们一小时后就要进行和解谈判了
We have a settlement meeting in an hour.

166
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,200
假如他们走进来时看到这些办公室都是空的
And if these offices are empty when they walk in,

167
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,460
我们就会非常难堪了
we are gonna look like shit.

168
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,560
路易  你有没有意识到
Louis, did it occur to you

169
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,750
我们在谈判中要威胁他们说我们要破产了
that we're using the threat of bankruptcy in that meeting,

170
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,480
而假如这些办公室都是满的
and if these offices are filled,

171
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,070
我们的计划就失效了
it kills that plan?

172
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,010
所有人立刻放下手中的活儿
Everybody drop whatever the hell it is you're doing

173
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,470
然后把你们的工作时间记录卡交给我秘书
and hand your timecards in to my secretary.

174
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,270
假如迟了一秒钟
And if they are marked one second late,

175
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,620
我向上帝发誓
I swear to God,

176
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,480
你再也不能在这座城市假扮律师了
you will never be fake associates in this town again.

177
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,740
下一位
Next.

178
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,940
-你好  -犯人姓名
- Hi. - Inmate's name?

179
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,390
迈克・罗斯  我是来探视的
Mike Ross. I'm here for visitation.

180
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,300
看来罗斯先生今天不能见访客
It appears Mr. Ross is not receiving visitors today.

181
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,220
我...我不明白
I-I don't understand.

182
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,900
我听说我是在获批访客名单上的
I was told that I was on the approved visitors list.

183
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,690
这里说是因为他今早的斗殴行为
It says visitation has been suspended for two weeks

184
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,740
两周内暂时不能接受探视
because of an altercation he had this morning.

185
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,180
不  不可能  他昨天才刚到这里
No, that can't be right. He just got here yesterday.

186
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,990
有可能  而且事实就是如此
It can be right, and it is right.

187
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,670
那么我需要马上见到他
Well then, I need to see him right away.

188
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,580
我刚刚才告诉你你不能见他
And I just told you you can't do that.

189
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,460
我可以  因为我不但是他的未婚妻
Yes, I can. Because not only am I his fiancé,

190
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,760
我还是他的律师
I'm also his lawyer.

191
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,380
这里写着他的律师是哈维・斯佩克特
It says here a Harvey Specter is his lawyer.

192
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,030
他是皮尔斯-斯派克特-利特律所的  我也是
And he works at Pearson, Specter, Litt, and so do I.

193
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,630
名片上写着律师助理
This card says paralegal.

194
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,470
我不在乎上面写着什么
I don't care what it says.

195
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,580
假如你不让我进去  然后他出事了
You don't let me in there and something's wrong with him,

196
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,670
我这辈子的目标就会是让你生不如死
I will make it my life's purpose to make your life a living hell.

197
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,000
女士  我干这行干了十年了
Ma'am, I worked maximum security for ten years,

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,790
所以如果你觉得我会被你这种人威胁
so if you think I'm gonna be intimidated by the likes of you,

199
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,800
你就大错特错了
you've got another thing coming.

200
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,810
一般来说犯人进来几周后才会第一次违规
You know, usually it takes prisoners a couple of weeks to get their first violation.

201
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,980
你来这里还不到24小时
You've been here less than 24 hours.

202
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,180
可能都破纪录了
That might just be a record.

203
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,780
行了  我不在乎  我需要打个电话
Yeah, I don't care. I need to make a phone call.

204
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,770
在你刚刚的所作所为之后  你什么也不能干
You're not making anything after what you just did.

205
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,910
我什么也没干  是他陷害我
I didn't do anything. He set me up.

206
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,980
我不在乎他干了什么
I don't care what he did.

207
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,660
所以你说的那堆帮我成为 "更好的我"
So all that stuff about you helping me become a "better version" of myself,

208
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,300
都是在放屁吗
that was bullshit?

209
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,360
-不  不是  -那你到底是什么意思
- No, it wasn't. - Then what exactly did you mean?

210
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,190
因为如果连我的说法你都不听
Because if you won't even hear my side of the story,

211
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,580
那你要怎么帮我
then how are you gonna help me?

212
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,740
好吧  你说他陷害你是什么意思
All right, what do you mean he set you up?

213
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,700
我的意思是  他收买了警卫
I mean, he paid off a guard,

214
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,000
然后他装作是我的室友
then he posed as my roommate,

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,880
接下来他就打算把我未婚妻的照片
and the next thing I know, he's about to hand out pictures of my fiancé

216
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,390
发给这整座监狱里的所有犯人了
to every inmate in this entire prison.

217
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,350
没有证据显示有什么照片
There's no evidence of any pictures.

218
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,690
那些照片不是撒了一地吗
But they were all over the floor.

219
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,500
这就是撒了一地的东西
This is what was all over the floor.

220
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,710
听我说  也许的确没有证据
Listen to me, there might not be any proof,

221
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,110
但我告诉你  他收买了一个警卫
but I am telling you that he paid off a guard

222
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,140
而你需要对此采取一些行动
and you need to do something about it.

223
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,880
兄弟  我无权管那些警卫
Brother, I don't have any authority over the guards.

224
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,690
那我到底在这里干什么
Then what exactly am I doing here?

225
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,600
你在学习如何在不使情况恶化的前提下
You are learning how to deal with the bullshit life throws your way

226
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,350
处理生活对你的蹂躏
without making your situation worse.

227
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,660
我他妈要怎样才能做到那一点
And how the hell am I supposed to do that?

228
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,900
这可不是茶会
This isn't just a tea party.

229
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,210
这次谈话的目的是观察你是否值得被改造
The purpose of this meeting is to decide if you are worth rehabilitating or not.

230
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,300
假如值得呢
And if I am?

231
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,790
那我会给你一份工作
Then I get you a job.

232
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,910
假如不值得呢
And if I'm not?

233
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,810
那你就再也不会见到我了
Then you never see me again.

234
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,540
然后等你下次再出什么意外的时候
And the next time you have an incident,

235
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,370
你就要被单独监禁一个月了
you will go to solitary confinement for a month.

236
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,590
所以我建议你回到自己的囚室
So I suggest you go back to your cell

237
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,750
好好想想在这里服刑期间你想做到什么
and you think long and hard about what you want to accomplish during your time here.

238
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,640
必须承认
I have to say,

239
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,010
我很高兴你们决定和解
I'm glad you've decided to settle

240
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,560
而不是打官司
rather than fight these suits.

241
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,110
如你所见  这里的情况有些紧张
Well, as you can see, things are a little tight around here,

242
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,480
我们处于劣势
so you have us at a disadvantage.

243
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,530
我只知道你们不想在接下来的六个月里
What I have is the fact that you don't want to be talking

244
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,500
在庭上谈论你们雇用了一个骗子这件事
about having hired a fraud in court for the next six months.

245
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,240
对  我们不想  所以...
No, we don't, so...

246
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,980
恕我直言  这不是一份提议
With all due respect, this isn't an offer,

247
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,990
而是一份废纸
it's a typo.

248
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,830
也恕我直言  这不是诉讼
And with all due respect, this isn't a lawsuit,

249
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,550
而是敲诈
it's a shakedown.

250
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,620
胡说八道
Bullshit.

251
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,330
这是让你们和被你们欺骗的客户们
This is a chance for you to wipe the slate clean

252
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,590
一笔勾销过去的机会
with the clients you defrauded.

253
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,690
一千万已经是很大"一笔"了
And $10 million is a hell of a goddamn wipe.

254
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,170
这只是罚金的十分之一而已
It's ten cents on the dollar.

255
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,810
你要是不接受  就一分钱都没有了
If you don't take it, it's going to be zero cents on the dollar.

256
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,030
你这是什么意思
What the hell are you talking about?

257
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,970
这笔钱是从我们合伙人的入股基金里来的
This money is from our partner buy-in fund.

258
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,470
是我们仅存的现金了
It's the only cash we have.

259
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,180
一旦合伙人们发现我们用这笔钱来和解
And once the partners find out that we're using it to settle,

260
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,540
他们不会善罢甘休的
they're gonna come after it.

261
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,960
所以你大概有一小时的时间
So you have about an hour

262
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,680
在落款上签名
to sign on the dotted line,

263
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,410
不然就永远也别想得到那笔钱
or that money's gone forever.

264
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,680
仔细想清楚吧  阿琳
So take a look around, Arlene,

265
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,390
错过这笔钱  也就没钱再给你了
'cause once it's gone, there isn't any more left.

266
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,690
你们蓄意诈骗自己的客户
You knowingly defrauded your own clients.

267
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,630
你们这是对司法系统的嘲讽
You made a mockery of the legal system.

268
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,460
我不会让你们免于责罚的
And I won't let you get away with it.

269
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,530
这么跟你说吧  阿琳
You want to know something, Arlene?

270
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,740
我们的确做过错事  也正为此付出代价
We did something wrong, and now we're paying for it.

271
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,080
但我已经有点厌倦所有人都一副
But I'm getting a little sick and tired

272
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,140
被迈克・罗斯坑了的样子
of people acting like Mike Ross screwed them over.

273
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,200
他全心全意地对待每一位客户
He gave his heart and soul to every client he ever had,

274
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,110
如果重审那些案件
and if those cases were reopened,

275
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,870
结果不会有丝毫变化
they would end up exactly in the same place.

276
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,560
因此  你签不签随你
So, you can sign that deal or not,

277
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,540
但我可不会
but I'm not gonna spend another second

278
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,670
在你们这些寄生虫身上浪费时间了
dealing with a parasite like you.

279
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,730
唐娜  哈维在哪  我有事找他
Donna, where's Harvey? I need to talk to him.

280
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,160
他刚谈判完
He's finishing up a negotiation.

281
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,070
-是急事  -怎么了  出什么事了
- This can't wait. - Why? What's going on?

282
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,970
我去了监狱  但他们没让我进去
I got up there and they turned me away.

283
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,710
这不可能  我帮你申请上了
No, that can't be. I got you on that list.

284
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,980
不是因为这个  他们拒绝我来访
That's not it. They turned me away

285
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,060
是因为他跟人打架了
because he got into a fight.

286
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,280
-什么  跟谁打架了  -我不知道
- What? With who? - I don't know.

287
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,920
就在我去探视他的时候
All I know is that I went to go and see him,

288
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,930
他们说他打了架
they said he got into a fight,

289
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,500
所以没让我进去探视
and then they wouldn't let me in.

290
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,030
-很好  -这算哪门子好
- Good. - How is that good?

291
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,340
因为如果他们不让你进
Because if they wouldn't let you in,

292
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,530
就证明他还手了
it means he fought back.

293
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,360
只是被人打了是不会被取消探视权的
You don't lose visitation if you just got jumped.

294
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
哈维  我不在乎他是否还手了
Harvey, I don't care if he fought back or not.

295
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,980
还手了也不代表他没事
It doesn't mean that he's okay.

296
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,750
瑞秋  听我说  他们有义务
Rachel, listen to me. They have an obligation

297
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,990
告知你他是否进了医务室
to tell you if he's in the infirmary.

298
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,880
他们提过他进了医务室吗
Did they tell you he was in the infirmary?

299
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,600
没有
No.

300
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,100
那好  我知道该怎么做了
Okay, then this is what I'm gonna do.

301
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,940
我会给监狱打电话问清来龙去脉
I'm gonna call up there and get to the bottom of this,

302
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,570
但这得需要点时间  所以你要有耐心
but it might take a while, so I need you to be patient.

303
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,480
好的
Okay.

304
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,160
唐娜  取消我下午的行程
Donna, cancel my afternoon

305
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,640
让雷五分钟之内在楼下等我
and have Ray meet me downstairs in five minutes.

306
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,910
我还以为你不担心迈克呢
I thought you said you weren't worried about Mike.

307
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,830
我那么说只是为了让她不担心
I only said that so that she wouldn't worry.

308
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,970
监狱取消他的探视权
They only take visitation away if you're the one

309
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,320
只能是因为是他挑起的事端
who starts the fight,

310
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,390
也就是说他出事了
which means something Goddamn happened down there

311
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,280
而我要查清楚究竟是怎么回事的
and I'm gonna figure out what it is.

312
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,370
格蕾琴  有什么事
Gretchen, what can I do for you?

313
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,630
我琢磨着既然大家都走了
Well, I thought since everyone was gone

314
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,060
我就来主管的厨房试试  换换口味
maybe I could help myself to the executive kitchen for a change.

315
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,230
只是想换换口味吗
For a change?

316
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,360
我想让你知道  我完全不知道
I wanted to let you know that I had no idea

317
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,240
那些人会走  不然我是绝对不会
those people were leaving or I never would have gone

318
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,890
-去牙医的  -我明白  格蕾琴
- to that appointment. - I know, Gretchen.

319
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,580
还有件事
I would also like to point out

320
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,750
既然大家都走了
that since they did leave,

321
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,680
就剩下你我  还有瑞秋・赞恩
between me, you, and Rachel Zane,

322
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,000
这公司女性的黑人比例可提升了一大截
this firm just got a whole lot blacker.

323
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,680
于我而言
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

324
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,070
这不会影响到任何事
that has nothing to do with anything.

325
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,280
格蕾琴  既然你来了
Gretchen, as long as you're here--

326
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,530
你想问我是否能同时兼任前台
You want to know if I can handle the reception desk

327
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,040
和路易斯的助理
and Louis at the same time.

328
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,950
你怎么知道我会问这件事
How did you know I was going to ask you that?

329
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,000
因为这是优秀秘书的素质
Because that's what good secretaries do.

330
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,560
说得没错
Sure as shit is.

331
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,970
大家都离职了也有一点好处
Well, there's one thing about everybody being gone.

332
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,720
我们三个什么时候有过机会像现在这样
When would the three of us ever find ourselves

333
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,240
在这里闲扯
in here just shooting the shit?

334
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,530
换做以前你也不会觉得这是什么好事
And when would you have thought that was a good thing?

335
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,510
这姑娘真是伶牙俐齿
This one is a keeper.

336
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,890
人家知道
I know.

337
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,460
对了  声明一下
Oh, and for the record,

338
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,400
我也是与黑人同心的
I'm black in here.

339
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,630
-你来干什么  -还用问
- What are you doing here? - What do you mean

340
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,540
我来干什么吗  我想知道出了什么事
what am I doing here? I want to know what's going on.

341
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,190
还能有什么事  什么事都没有
What's going on? Nothing's going on.

342
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,500
-我坐牢了  -什么都没发生吗
- I'm in prison. - Nothing's going on?

343
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,530
那你的脸是怎么回事
Then why do you look like that?

344
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,550
用不着你管
It is none of your business.

345
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,850
那现在是我主动要管
Well, I'm making it my business

346
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,940
因为瑞秋今早来探视你
because Rachel came to visit you this morning,

347
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,250
但被告知你跟人打架了
and they told her you got in a fight.

348
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,580
是啊  那你为什么不发挥专长
Yeah, well, why don't you do what you always do

349
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,680
随便编点什么  告诉她没这回事
and make up some bullshit and tell her it's not true?

350
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,220
因为我正忙着活下来呢
Because I'm busy trying to survive in here.

351
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,310
你有事为什么不告诉我
Why won't you tell me?

352
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,650
告诉你  你就会出面帮我解决
Because you'll try and handle it for me.

353
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,220
也许真该由我出面解决
Well, maybe I should be handling it for you

354
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,320
因为你太蠢了
because you're too stupid

355
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,360
蠢到第一天入狱就惹是生非
not to piss someone off on the first day.

356
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,940
好了  哈维  你不是想知道怎么回事吗
Okay, Harvey. You want to know what happened?

357
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,470
惹毛他的不是我
It wasn't me who pissed him off.

358
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,820
-是你  -这话什么意思
- It was you. - What are you talking about?

359
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,430
-弗兰克・加洛  -该死
- Frank Gallo. - Holy shit.

360
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,450
他怎么在这里
What's he doing in here?

361
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,030
不知道  我还指望你告诉我呢
I don't know. I was hoping you'd tell me that.

362
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,840
他因为敲诈勒索被我弄进监狱了
I put him away for racketeering.

363
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,880
这就说不通了
That doesn't make any sense.

364
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,970
我印象中  这种罪不会进这所监狱
Last time I checked, that doesn't land him in here.

365
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,800
没错
You're right.

366
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,710
加洛这种人能被关在这只有一个原因
A guy like Gallo only lands in here for one reason:

367
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,790
表现良好
good behavior.

368
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,580
你这口气怎么好像这还是好事
Why are you saying that like it's a good thing?

369
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,570
因为这意味着表现不良好他就不能在这儿
Because bad behavior can get him out.

370
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,400
-你要去哪  -去找典狱长
- Where are you going? - I'm gonna go to the warden.

371
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,470
告诉他前因后果
Tell him the whole story.

372
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,780
不用一周就能让他走人
We'll get him outta here within the week.

373
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,800
这就是我没告诉你的原因
That's exactly why I did not want to tell you.

374
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,400
这里的警卫都被收买了
Look, these guards are corrupt.

375
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,240
你去找典狱长  就会有人告诉加洛
You go to the warden, it gets back to Gallo,

376
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,820
他就会加倍来找我麻烦
he's gonna come after me twice as hard.

377
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,190
那也不过是一周的时间  你还有两年
It's one week instead of two years.

378
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,410
我们要有机会让他转狱就得把握机会
Look, we got a chance to get him outta here, I'm gonna take it.

379
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,200
他有瑞秋的电话号码
He's got Rachel's phone number.

380
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,150
那就更有理由该这么做了...
that's all the more reason to do it...

381
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,680
该死的  哈维
God damn it, Harvey!

382
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,440
你自己逼我胖揍你一顿
You pushed me to beat the shit out of you

383
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,500
以此证明我能在这里照顾好自己
so that you'd know I could take care of myself in here,

384
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,800
你现在是想让我自己解决
now are you gonna let me do that,

385
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,940
还是拖我的后腿
or are you gonna cut my legs out from under me?

386
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,930
我不插手
I'll stay out of it.

387
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,960
我要你保证
I want your word.

388
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,880
我保证不去找监狱长
I won't go to the warden.

389
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,930
我还在想你要什么时候才现身
I was wondering when you'd show up.

390
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,200
别搞得跟不认识我一样  哈维
Don't act like you don't remember me, Harvey.

391
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,640
你我都心知肚明你为什么来这
We both know why you're here.

392
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,080
我不明白你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

393
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,430
我来这是为了见委托人
I'm here because I represent the prison.

394
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,820
胡扯
Bullshit.

395
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
我戳到了你的痛处  所以你才来
I pulled a string and you came.

396
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,750
你以为在你准备走的时候
You think it's a coincidence I'm standing here

397
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,250
我在这里是个巧合吗
while you're walking out?

398
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,550
好吧  加洛  你引起我的注意了
Okay, Gallo, you got my attention.

399
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,240
你想让我进去
You want me to step inside?

400
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,760
还是你想出来
Or you want to come out here?

401
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,800
我们都知道这不可能
We both know that's not possible.

402
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,180
你欠我的13年
You owe me 13 years.

403
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,760
我会收回来的
I'm gonna collect.

404
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,920
那个调查员
I didn't do anything to you

405
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,260
本来就在调查你  你也知道我并没多做什么
that that investigator didn't start and you know it.

406
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,330
如果他的小男友出现在这里
Well, if his little boyfriend ever shows up in here,

407
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,730
我也会去找他的
I'll be sure to take it up with him.

408
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,900
你到底想要什么  加洛
What do you want, Gallo?

409
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,600
我已经得到想要的了
I already have what I want.

410
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,940
那就是知道了每次你电话响的时候
Which is knowing that every time your phone rings,

411
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,310
你都要自问这通电话是不是要告诉你
you're gonna ask yourself is this the call where you find out

412
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,960
为你进来的那个家伙
that the guy who's in here for you

413
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,630
永远出不去了
is never coming out.

414
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,950
听着  你这个贱人
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

415
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,790
你以为你进去了我就动不了你了吗
you think I can't hurt you in here?

416
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,630
我会悬赏你的人头
I'll put a Goddamn bounty on your head.

417
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,000
只要能打断你的腿  我付多少都可以
I'll pay 'em whatever it takes to break your legs.

418
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,500
如果这不管用
And if that doesn't work,

419
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,300
我就等你出来然后亲手干掉你
I'll wait till you get out and I'll kill you myself.

420
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,060
如果你不想这般下场
So unless you want that to happen,

421
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,110
就别再去惹迈克・罗斯
don't you ever even look at Mike Ross again.

422
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,090
铃铃电话响了  大律师
Ring, ring, counselor.

423
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,860
铃  铃
Ring, ring.

424
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,840
我就知道会在这找到你
I knew I'd find you here.

425
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,080
因为每次你觉得打败了某人
'Cause this is where you come

426
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,790
就会来这里
when you think you just beat somebody.

427
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,830
我能为你做什么  杰克
What can I do for you, Jack?

428
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,690
你可以告诉我你是用自己的钱来解决这场诉讼
You can tell me you used your own money to settle that lawsuit.

429
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,190
因为如果不是的话  我们就有麻烦了
'Cause if you didn't, we're gonna have a problem.

430
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,550
那我告诉你我们有麻烦了
Then I'd say we have a problem.

431
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,750
该死的  你用了入股金
God damn it. You used the buy-in fund.

432
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,930
是的  我用了
Yes, we did.

433
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,480
那样的话
Then I guess...

434
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,360
我们法庭见了
I'll see you in court.

435
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,180
你要起诉我个人
You're suing me personally?

436
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,410
-门上写的是你的名字  -杰克
- It's your name on the door. - Jack.

437
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,810
我知道公司结构从来不是你的强项
I know corporate structures were never your strong suit,

438
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,530
所以我要给你解释解释
so I'm gonna explain something to you.

439
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,680
我们虽然用"合伙人"这个词
We may use the word "Partnership,"

440
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,380
但这是个有限责任公司
but this is a LLC.

441
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,770
这世上没有一个法官
And no judge in the world

442
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,500
会让你打破这个规矩的
is going to let you pierce that corporate veil.

443
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,430
当他们知道你雇了个冒牌货时就会了
They will once they learn you knowingly hired a fraud.

444
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,270
这二者毫无关系
One has nothing to do with the other.

445
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,030
即便你真的找到了这样的法官
And if you really did find a judge who would do that,

446
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,540
那你也早带着一卡车的律师来了
then you'd be here with an army of lawyers and a Brinks truck

447
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,770
而不是汗涔涔的小手握着一张破纸
instead of standing alone with a flimsy piece of paper

448
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,310
独自一人站在这儿
in your sweaty little hands.

449
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,180
你再嘴硬也没有  杰西卡
You can talk tough all you want, Jessica.

450
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,460
实际上  我的确有一卡车律师而你没有
The fact is, I do have an army of lawyers and you don't.

451
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,530
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

452
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,990
我最后还是在罗伯特・赞恩那找了份工作
I took that job with Robert Zane after all.

453
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,020
我愿意把这一战打下去
And I'm willing to drag this fight out,

454
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,930
这就看你了
so the choice is yours.

455
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,400
把我们的钱还给我们  或者破产倒闭
Give us our money or go out of business.

456
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,880
我可以跟你聊两句吗
Can I talk to you for a second?

457
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,060
聊什么
About what?

458
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,110
牢房本该是让你觉得安全的地方
Listen, a man's cell should be the one place he can feel safe.

459
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,140
我把你的这个权利剥夺了  我很抱歉
I took that away from you, and I'm sorry.

460
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,190
没错  但对不起在这管个屁用
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't do shit for me in here.

461
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,160
我知道
I know.

462
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,380
所以我想弥补错误
That's why I want to make it up to you.

463
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,620
你逗我玩吧
Are you kidding me?

464
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,310
我现在这个状况就是一个电话搞的
That's exactly what got me in this situation in the first place.

465
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,140
我知道
I know that.

466
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,580
但我也知道你今天早上
But I also know you wanted to call

467
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,420
想给某个人打电话
whoever you wanted to call this morning.

468
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,170
我想帮你  跟你和解
And I'm trying to make it up to you.

469
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,470
这玩意和解不了
Yeah, well, this doesn't do that.

470
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,730
听着  光是让你知道我有这玩意
Hey, look, I can get in a lot of trouble

471
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,950
就能让我惹一身麻烦
for just letting you know I have this.

472
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,200
你为什么不干点别的来惹麻烦呢
Why don't you do something else that can get you into trouble?

473
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,050
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

474
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,530
告诉他们加洛贿赂警卫让你换房间
Tell them that Gallo paid the guards to have you switch.

475
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,210
我不能这么做
I can't do that.

476
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,510
对  因为你怕他
Yeah, because you're afraid of him.

477
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,030
你说的太他妈对了
You're damn straight I am.

478
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,850
最重要的是
And on top of that,

479
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,850
我会成为这里的众矢之的
I'd make a permanent enemy of everyone else in here,

480
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,840
因为在这地方  最招麻烦的名头
because the worst thing you can be known for, my man,

481
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,820
就是告密
is as someone who would do something like that.

482
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,470
也就是说我得自己对付这个人
Which means I get to deal with this all by myself.

483
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,800
没事  你可以坐在这
It's all right, you can stay.

484
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,790
他走不走无所谓
It doesn't matter if he stays or goes,

485
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,160
我跟你没什么可说的
I got nothing to say to you.

486
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,650
没事  因为我有要跟你说的
That's okay, 'cause I got something to say to you.

487
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,600
想知道来了这里后我最喜欢什么时候吗
You want to know what my favorite time of day is in here?

488
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,780
就是现在
It's right now.

489
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,940
有电视看
Got the TV going.

490
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,190
兄弟们坐在那里打牌讲笑话
Guys are sitting around playing cards, telling jokes.

491
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,900
能让人几乎忘掉是在监狱里
You almost forget you're in prison,

492
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,520
这就是我为什么过来
which is why I came over here.

493
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,680
因为我要保证让你永远忘不了
'Cause I want to make sure you never forget.

494
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,210
总有一天
There's gonna come a time

495
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,530
当这里没这么多人
when this place isn't filled with people,

496
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,250
只有你我两个人的时候
and you and I are alone.

497
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,600
连你哥们哈维・斯佩克特
Then all those vicious threats

498
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,500
今天对我的那番恶意威胁
your boy Harvey Specter made to me today

499
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,000
也救不了你
aren't gonna save you.

500
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,640
听说兰德-考德-赞恩律所今天过得不错
I heard today was a good day for Rand, Kaldor, Zane.

501
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,200
如果你是指我雇佣杰克・索罗夫的部门
If this is about me hiring Jack Soloff's department,

502
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,090
我这么做不是为了和你作对
I didn't do it to stick it to you.

503
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,970
-反正他们都要离开了  -也许吧
- They were leaving anyway. - Maybe.

504
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,890
但如果你的第一步
But if your first move

505
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,850
就是让他们来要回合伙人的钱
is to have them come after their partner money,

506
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,240
那我一定误解了我们之前的友好关系
then I must have been wrong that we were on good terms.

507
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,490
杰西卡  我是接受了你的道歉
Jessica, I accepted your apology.

508
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,860
我觉得这并不等于我们很要好
I wouldn't say that makes us on good terms.

509
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,220
但他找你要钱可不是我指使的
But I had nothing to do with him coming after your money.

510
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,820
那是你和他的事
That's between you and him.

511
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,460
但你有能力阻止他
But you do have the power to stop it.

512
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,760
但我不喜欢指挥我的新员工的
And I am not in the habit of telling my brand new employees

513
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,240
一举一动
what they can and can't do.

514
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,610
你这次不喜欢也得干
Well, I need you to do it anyway.

515
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,540
杰西卡
Jessica--

516
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,420
罗伯特
Robert...

517
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,640
我需要你这么做
I need this.

518
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,350
我知道对合伙人指手画脚
And I know it's not your style

519
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,550
不是你的风格
to tell your partners what to do,

520
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,140
但如果你不这样做的话
but if you don't make it your style,

521
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,920
我就死定了
I'm dead in the water.

522
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,150
我是哈维・斯佩克特
This is Harvey Specter.

523
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,460
丹伯里联邦监狱有人向你致电
You have a call from Danbury Federal Prison.

524
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,400
-你愿意承担费用吗  -愿意
- Do you accept the charges? - Yes.

525
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,680
我不理解你的回答
I do not understand your response.

526
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,840
-我说愿意  -请回答是或否
- Yes. God damn it. - Please respond yes or no.

527
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,830
是
Yes.

528
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,770
-喂  -迈克  感谢上帝
- Hello. - Mike, thank God.

529
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,630
感谢他什么
Thank God what?

530
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,470
你看着我的眼睛
You looked me in the eye

531
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,860
跟我保证你不会管的
and you said you would stay out of it.

532
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,020
结果连停车场都没走到
You couldn't even make it to the parking lot

533
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,010
-就去威胁加洛了  -迈克  你听我说
- without threatening Gallo? - Mike, listen to me.

534
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,410
我不听  你还要继续骗我吗
No, what, so you can lie to me again?

535
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,400
还是说你要告诉我你没有去威胁他
Or are you gonna tell me you didn't do that?

536
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,850
我那么做不是因为我觉得
Look, I didn't do it because I didn't think

537
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,610
你处理不了
you could handle yourself.

538
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,310
我威胁他是因为他惹到我了
I did it because he got under my skin.

539
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,490
我才不管你是为什么这么做的
I don't give a shit why you did it.

540
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,540
你发誓说你不会这么做的
You swore you wouldn't.

541
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,000
但你现在把这事弄得更糟糕了
Instead, you've made things worse.

542
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,350
哈维  如果我连你都没法信任
Harvey, if I can't even trust you,

543
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,170
那我在这儿才真是没戏了
then I do not stand a chance in here.

544
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,250
我现在没法跟你说话
Look, I can't talk right now.

545
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,320
什么叫你现在没法说话
What do you mean you can't talk?

546
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,180
瑞秋现在正我办公室里盯着我看
Rachel's in my office looking at me right now

547
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,150
再过五秒她肯定起疑出了什么事
and she's gonna think something's wrong in five seconds,

548
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,440
所以除非你改变主意想让我告诉她了
so unless you've changed your mind about me not telling her,

549
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,030
否则我得挂了
I gotta go.

550
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,540
哈维  你得把她的电话拿走
Harvey, you gotta get the phone from her.

551
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,080
好的  瑞克  没问题
Sure, Rick, no problem.

552
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,750
-哈维  拿走她的电话  -八点半没问题
- Harvey, get the phone from her. - 8:30 sounds great.

553
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,360
第一轮你请
First round's on you.

554
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,820
瑞秋  正好你在
Rachel, good, you're here.

555
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,910
我正好找你呢
I was just gonna come see you.

556
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,420
你没联系我  所以我想着
I didn't hear from you, so I just figured--

557
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,780
他没事  是系统出错了
He's good. There was an error in the paperwork.

558
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,040
出事的犯人不是他  刚好同姓而已
It's a different inmate, same last name.

559
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,120
好的  那我明天就能见他了
Okay. So I can see him tomorrow.

560
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,860
其实  他说希望你给他点时间
Actually, he asked that you give him a little time.

561
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,800
-什么  -瑞秋  监狱对他是个大改变
- What? - Rachel, prison is a big adjustment.

562
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,520
过两周他就能适应点了
He'll be ready in about two weeks.

563
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,810
那为什么他给我发了五十多条短信
So then, why do I have about 50 texts from him

564
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,530
跟我说他等不及要见我了
saying that he can't wait to see me?

565
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,930
-什么  -哈维  到底怎么回事
- What? - Harvey, what's going on?

566
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,710
-手机给我  -不给
- Give me the phone. - No.

567
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,250
-我说把手机给我  -除非告诉我怎么回事
- I said give me the phone. - I'm not giving you anything

568
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,920
否则就不给你
until you tell me what's going on.

569
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,470
那些短信不是迈克发的
Those texts aren't from Mike.

570
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,750
那是谁发的
Then who are they from?

571
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,280
是我当检察官的时候抓的一个人发的
From a guy I put away when I was an ADA.

572
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,920
天哪
Oh, my God.

573
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,990
瑞秋  别自己吓自己
Rachel, don't let your imagination run wild.

574
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,810
-没事的  -你怎么知道
- It's gonna be okay. - You don't know that

575
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,870
-进监狱的又不是你  -没错  不是我
- because you're not in there. - You're right, I'm not.

576
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,170
那你打算怎么办
Then what the hell are you gonna do about it?

577
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,000
我打算按我答应迈克的办
I'm gonna do what I promised Mike.

578
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,090
那就是相信他能处理好
I'm gonna have faith that he can handle it.

579
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,740
真不敢相信  你打算袖手旁观吗
I don't believe it. So you're not gonna do anything?

580
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,120
你以为我不想马上救他出来吗
You think I don't want to bust him outta there right now?

581
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,660
如果我想了办法又没成功
Look, if I try and do something and it doesn't work,

582
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,100
他会更难处理
it makes it worse for him.

583
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,400
-那人暴力吗  -瑞秋
- Is he violent? - Rachel--

584
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,580
-那人暴力吗  -我保证了他
- Is he violent? - I made him a promise--

585
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,100
我不管你保证了什么
I don't give a shit.

586
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,630
他进去是为了保护你
He's in there to protect you,

587
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,150
所以你最好想个办法保护好他
so you better figure out a way to protect him

588
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,610
否则我告诉你  哈维
because Goddamn it, Harvey,

589
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,390
要是他在里面出了什么事
if something happens to him in there

590
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,800
你又袖手旁观
and you didn't do anything,

591
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,490
我绝对不会原谅你的
I will never forgive you.

592
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,720
哈维  我知道你用不着我来告诉你
Harvey, I know you don't need me to tell you this,

593
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,430
但她是对的
but she's right,

594
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,510
如果迈克真出了什么事
because if something actually does happen to Mike,

595
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,050
就算她原谅了你
even if she forgives you,

596
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,870
你也不会原谅自己的
you're never gonna forgive yourself.

597
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,570
什么事  哈维
What do you want, Harvey?

598
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,580
只要你五分钟
Five minutes of your time and that's all.

599
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,410
要五分钟是聊天  还是找我帮忙
Five minutes to catch up, or five minutes to ask a favor?

600
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,700
要你五分钟  帮我保护迈克・罗斯
Five minutes to help me protect Mike Ross.

601
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,110
怎么保护  如果我没记错
Protect him how? 'Cause last time I checked,

602
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,230
他现在好像进了监狱吧
he was in the bosom of the federal penitentiary system.

603
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,190
肖恩  他和我抓的一个人被关在一起
Sean, he's in there with a guy I put away

604
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,930
那人可不是吃素的
and the guy is no joke.

605
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,110
我很遗憾  哈维
I'm sorry to hear that, Harvey.

606
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,550
但你要我做什么
But what am I supposed to do?

607
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,690
我要你把那个人转到别的监狱
You're supposed to move the guy to another prison.

608
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,660
我没权力这么做
I don't have the authority to do that and you know that.

609
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,140
你能想办法弄到这个权力
You can get the authority.

610
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,220
你可是联邦检察官
You're a federal prosecutor.

611
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,740
那你为什么不直接去找
Then why the hell don't you go after the prosecutor

612
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,250
起诉迈克的检察官
that put Mike away in the first place?

613
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,490
因为她不欠我什么  你欠我
'Cause she doesn't owe me, and you do.

614
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,410
我们合作那么久的时间里
You got a lot of balls saying that to me

615
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,100
你一直都知道他是冒牌货
when the entire time we were working together,

616
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,480
居然还敢来跟我说这话
you knew the kid was a fraud.

617
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,320
那个孩子帮你扳倒了
That kid helped you take down

618
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,480
查尔斯・傅滋曼和埃里克・伍德尔
Charles Forstman and Eric Woodall

619
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,500
让你有了名气
and put you on the map.

620
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,620
出名  别扯了
The map? Bullshit.

621
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,450
认识你们俩之前我就很有名
I was on the map long before I met either of you.

622
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,900
你是想告诉我那次定罪没让你
You're going to tell me you haven't shot up the ranks

623
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,180
青云直上吗
since that conviction?

624
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,460
哈维  你刚进来的时候
You know, Harvey, when you first walked in here,

625
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,640
我还以为你是因为骗了我这么久
for a second I actually thought you were gonna apologize

626
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,190
而向我道歉
for lying to me all that time.

627
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,710
我不需要你的原谅  肖恩
I don't need your forgiveness, Sean.

628
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,050
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

629
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,020
好吧  我想想办法
All right, I'll see what I can do.

630
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,930
但是  哈维
But, Harvey,

631
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,500
现在是你欠我了
now you owe me one.

632
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,060
杰克
Jack?

633
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,800
我今天很累  你来这里做什么
I've had a long day. What are you doing here?

634
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,160
你知道我来做什么
You know what I'm doing here.

635
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,160
你去找罗伯特・赞恩  让他制止了我们
You went to Robert Zane and you had him shut us down.

636
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,630
我只是做了必须要做的
I did what I had to do.

637
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,840
我要走了
Now if you'll excuse me.

638
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,250
我只是想要回我的钱而已
All I wanted was my money back.

639
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,710
你越早接受钱已经没有了的事实
Well, the sooner you get used to the fact that it's gone,

640
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,490
我们就能越快重回各自生活的正轨
the sooner we can both move on with our lives.

641
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,060
这就是问题所在  我回不了
That's the problem. I can't move on with my life.

642
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,030
你说什么
What are you talking about?

643
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,660
我付不起赞恩的买入金
I can't afford Zane's buy-in.

644
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,660
什么
What?

645
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,780
这怎么可能
How is that possible?

646
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,230
杰西卡  听我说
Jessica, listen to me.

647
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,470
虽然你知道哈德曼知道我做了什么
You know what I did that Hardman found out about,

648
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,330
但你不知道的是我为什么要那么做
but what you don't know is why I did it.

649
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,680
我需要那笔钱
I needed the money.

650
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,180
现在你想让我拿自己的钱
And now you want me to give you your money back

651
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,320
来还你吗
out of my own pocket?

652
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,590
杰西卡  拜托
Jessica, please.

653
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,950
这是我重新开始的机会
This is a chance for me to have a new start.

654
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,570
即使我想帮你  我也不能这么做
Even if I wanted to, I can't do that.

655
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,650
-为什么  -你知道为什么
- Why not? - You know why not.

656
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,150
我自掏腰包
I pay you out of my own pocket.

657
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,340
就是自己排除了对公司有限责任的特权
I'm piercing that corporate veil myself.

658
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,270
要是合伙人知道了  我会赔上几百万的
And if the partners find out, it will cost me millions.

659
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,340
他们不会知道的
They won't find out.

660
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,540
我不能冒这个险
Well, I can't take that chance.

661
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,780
杰西卡  我需要这笔钱
Jessica, I need this.

662
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,840
对不起  杰克
I'm sorry, Jack.

663
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,510
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

664
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,840
早上好
Morning.

665
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,770
怎么了
What?

666
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,150
你知道怎么了
You know what.

667
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,870
我牙齿上有东西吗
Do I have something in my teeth?

668
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,280
没有  但是你脑子有问题
No, but you got some bullshit in your brain.

669
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,580
-什么  -"这里是黑的"
- Excuse me? - "Black in here."

670
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,440
拜托  我见过的女人没人能比你白
Please, you're the whitest woman I ever met.

671
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,410
是吗
Is that a fact?

672
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,680
那你倒是说说看
Tell me something different.

673
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,010
耳听为虚  眼见为实
How about I show you something different?

674
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,280
-那不是...  -是的
- Is that... - Yep.

675
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,670
-你肯定在逗我  -没有
- You gotta be kidding me. - Nope.

676
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,740
-那是哪一年  -96年
- What year was that? - '96.

677
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,310
-你们交往了多久  -七个月
- How long were you together? - Seven months.

678
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,880
信了吧  看不惯夫人
That that, Mrs. Hater.

679
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,170
他上一张专辑之前还是之后
Before his last album or after?

680
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,900
你以为那首歌是写的谁
Who do you think that song was about?

681
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,340
该死  "这里是黑的"
Shit. "Black in here."

682
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,540
简直全身都是黑的
She's black all over.

683
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,880
很高兴我们能达成一致
I'm glad we came to an agreement.

684
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,340
我通常是不向
And it's usually not my habit

685
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,970
对方律师献殷勤的
to court a dalliance with opposing counsel,

686
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,010
不过我注意到
but I couldn't help but notice

687
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,110
你手上没戴戒指
you don't have a ring on your finger.

688
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,020
想都别想  利特先生 
Not in a million years, Mr. Litt.

689
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,520
请回你的位置
Go back to your own side.

690
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,460
对于一个如此主动的男人  你至少得...
Man puts himself out there, the least you can do is...

691
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,720
关于针对皮尔逊  斯佩克特和利特的集体诉讼案
Regarding the class action against Pearson, Specter, Litt,

692
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,930
双方都同意和解条款吗
do both parties agree to the terms of the settlement?

693
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,080
-是的  法官  -我们也是  法官
- We do, Your honor. - We do as well, Your Honor.

694
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,370
如果没有人持有异议
Then unless there are any objections,

695
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,870
本庭将批准...
I see no reason for this court not to ratify--

696
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,600
我有异议  法官
I have an objection, Your Honor.

697
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,890
-什么  -你是
- What? - And you are?

698
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,640
他是艾略特・斯坦普尔  法官
His name is A. Elliott Stemple, Your Honor,

699
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,190
他无权参与此案
and he has no standing in this case.

700
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,240
利特先生
Mr. Litt.

701
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,310
我是没有权利  法官
I have no standing, Your Honor.

702
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,450
但我代表罗斯曼保险公司
But I represent Rothman Insurance,

703
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,480
本公司虽不是本集体诉讼案的客户
a company not included in the class of clients

704
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,570
但同样由这个故意雇了一位骗子的律所代理
misrepresented by a firm that knowingly hired a fraud.

705
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,060
没有任何证据能够证明我们故意做了什么
There's not one shred of proof we knowingly did anything.

706
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,050
但是有证据证明你们雇了一位骗子
But there is proof that you employed a fraud,

707
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,680
这也是你们要和罗森小姐
which is why you're settling with Ms. Rosen

708
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,910
进行和解的原因
in the first place.

709
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,850
-你们一伙的吗  -开什么玩笑
- Are you in on this? - Are you kidding me?

710
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,840
好了  斯坦普尔先生  呈上你的证据
All right, Mr. Stemple. Submit your evidence.

711
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,750
明天本庭将给出判决
The court will rule on it tomorrow.

712
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,620
我们虽然同意以十分之一的金额进行和解
We may have agreed to ten cents on the dollar,

713
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,220
但要是这事儿黄了
but if this goes south,

714
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,510
我们会拿走你们的每一分钱
we're coming after you for every penny you've got.

715
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,590
你这个混蛋
You little son of a bitch.

716
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,420
说话小心点  利特  这里是法庭
Watch it, Litt. We're in a court of law.

717
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,530
我才不管这是哪  是杰克・索罗夫让你来的
I don't care where we are. Jack Soloff put you up to this,

718
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,640
-我知道  -那又怎样
- and I know it. - So what?

719
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,540
那么我就会证明
So I'm gonna prove it.

720
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,980
一旦法官知道你做了什么
And when the judge realizes what you did,

721
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,850
他就会让你进监狱
he's gonna throw your ass in jail.

722
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,100
是吗
Really? Huh.

723
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,650
因为在我看来  法官会证明我的客户是
Because the way I see it, the judge is gonna certify

724
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,340
这个集体诉讼案的一员  因为不管杰克
that my client is a member of this class because they are one

725
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,810
有没有告诉我他们都是一体的
whether Jack tipped me off to them or not.

726
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,750
到时候  合同失效
And when that happens, I kill the deal,

727
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,780
你们就要把钱
and your money goes back to

728
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,150
还给所有的合伙人
the partners that you took it from.

729
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,290
所以  你何不拖着你这两只肥腿
So, why don't you march your fat feet

730
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,560
回到那仅剩两位律师的
back to the only two lawyers left

731
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,820
悲剧小律所
at that miserable little firm

732
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,780
然后想想要怎么倾家荡产
and decide just how deep you're gonna reach

733
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,960
来还我的钱
into your own pockets to pay me off.

734
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,910
因为在我看来
Because as I see it, phew,

735
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,560
一天后你们将失去一切
you have about 24 hours until you lose everything.

736
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,170
你又想干嘛  哈维
What do you want now, Harvey?

737
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,890
我想就加洛的事向你道歉
I wanted to apologize for what happened with Gallo.

738
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,030
那样是不对的
It was wrong.

739
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,270
根本就不应该发生  我很抱歉
Shouldn't have happened, and I'm sorry.

740
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,120
但是呢
But?

741
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,440
但是我不在乎我给你承诺了什么
But I don't care what I promised you

742
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,640
因为我找到了一个方法让他离开这里
because I found a way to get him out of here,

743
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,030
我也要这么做
and I'm gonna take it.

744
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,820
我告诉过你  如果你去找典狱长...
I told you, you go to the warden--

745
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,560
我不是要去找典狱长  我去找了肖恩・卡荷尔
I'm not going to the warden. I went to Sean Cahill.

746
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,430
这意味着在他们给他带上
Which means Gallo won't know about it

747
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,170
镣铐让滚回他该待的地方之前  
until they're putting shackles on him

748
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,870
加洛是不会知道的
to take him back to wherever the hell he came from.

749
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,300
有什么是你没告诉我的
What are you not telling me?

750
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,090
我让他以敲诈罪的名义进了监狱
I put him away for racketeering.

751
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,420
但这并不是他真正的罪行
But that's not what he really did.

752
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,940
你说什么
What are you talking about?

753
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,460
我们发现他参与了谋杀案
We had him for conspiracy to commit murder.

754
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,990
但是警方就让他认罪的那个视频
And the police let the tape of that bastard admitting

755
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,030
落在了证据链外二十分钟
that he did it out of the chain of custody

756
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,550
导致证据无效
for 20 minutes.

757
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,870
所以你转而以敲诈勒索来来追究他的责任
So you went after him for racketeering instead.

758
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,970
我用了三个
I used every trick I had to put him away

759
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,030
最多五年的罪名
for 15 years for three crimes

760
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,970
让他被判了15年
that would have added to five years at the most.

761
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,480
所以他那么恨你
And that's why he hates you so much.

762
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,890
这也是我把他从这弄走之前
It's also why I need you to lay low

763
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,410
需要你低调一点的原因
until I can get him out of here.

764
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,030
这我能理解  哈维
Oh, I can appreciate that, Harvey,

765
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,480
但我没法整天都躲在我自己的牢房里
but I can't exactly hide in my cell 24 hours a day.

766
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,400
那么我建议你反其道而行之
Then I suggest you do the complete opposite.

767
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,210
你知道吗  我一般不接待没有预约的人
You know, I don't normally take walk-ins.

768
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,570
抱歉
Sorry.

769
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,200
不过你既然来了
Well, as long as you're here.

770
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,130
我想过了  然后
Well, I thought about it, and...

771
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,850
我希望有份工作
I'd like a job.

772
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,280
并且如果不是太麻烦的话
And if it's not too much trouble,

773
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,930
我希望尽可能出现在人多的地方
I'd like it to be in front of as many people as possible.

774
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,330
为什么希望如此呢
And why is that?

775
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,800
在人群中我更容易不去招惹是非
It'll be easier for me to stay out of trouble in a crowd.

776
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,890
很好
Good.

777
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,470
因为我在厨房给你安排了一份工作
Because I got you a job in the kitchen.

778
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,310
谢谢
Thank you.

779
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,970
别谢我  谢你自己就行了
Don't thank me. Thank yourself.

780
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,890
如果你没有冲进来见我
If you hadn't come in to see me,

781
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,630
我永远不会和你说这事的
I never would have told you about it.

782
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,260
是真的吗
Is that true?

783
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,650
你真的不接待没有预约的人吗
You don't really take walk-ins?

784
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,270
才不是
Nah.

785
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,370
只是说说而已
Just something to say.

786
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,600
账单记录就在那里
The billing records are right there.

787
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,730
迈克当时出席了会议
Mike was at the meeting.

788
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,860
该死  你说对了  他抓到我们的把柄了
Shit, you're right. He's got us.

789
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,360
-你知道这代表着什么  -我知道
- You know what this means. - I do.

790
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,580
路易  我刚收到你的信息
Louis, I just got your message.

791
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,070
-发生什么事了  -哈维  我们有麻烦了
- What's going on? - Harvey, we got a problem,

792
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,150
而且你不会喜欢的
and you're not going to like it.

793
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,720
艾略特・斯坦普尔与一个
Elliott Stemple showed up in court

794
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,590
被集体诉讼除名的公司一起出现在了法庭上
with an excluded member of the class.

795
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,910
艾略特・斯坦普尔  你在开玩笑吗
Elliott Stemple? Are you kidding me?

796
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,920
他伏击了我  哈维  法官正准备
He ambushed me, Harvey. The judge was about to ratify

797
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,360
批准和解方案  他不知道从哪冒了出来
the settlement when he comes out of nowhere.

798
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,450
你让我怎么办
What was I supposed to do?

799
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,440
证明他的委托人不在集体诉讼的原告里
You prove his client isn't part of the class,

800
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,550
然而把这事情给压下去
and you shut this thing down.

801
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,200
不行  他的委托人的确是集体诉讼原告之一
I can't do that because his client is a part of the class.

802
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,930
-什么  那不可能  -是的  就是这样
- What? That's not possible. - Yes, it is.

803
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,110
迈克和罗斯曼保险公司有过一次会面
Mike took one meeting with Rothman Insurance.

804
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,760
杰克・索罗夫把这事告诉了斯坦普尔
Jack Soloff told Stemple about it.

805
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,440
-不可能  -都在这了  哈维
- No way. - It's all right here, Harvey.

806
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,080
而且如果我们今晚不付钱给他
And if we don't pay him off tonight,

807
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,350
明天他就不会接受这个条件了
he kills that deal tomorrow

808
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,190
而我们十分钟后就要停业了
and we're out of business ten minutes later.

809
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,390
狗屁  那是敲诈勒索
Bullshit. That's blackmail.

810
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,380
我是不会向敲诈勒索屈服的
I'm not giving in to blackmail.

811
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,750
拜托  你觉得我想这么做吗
Oh, come on, do you think I want to do this?

812
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,190
他捏着我们的命根子  哈维
He's got us by the balls, Harvey.

813
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,820
如果我们不付钱给他  那么那天晚上我们
If we don't pay him, what was everything we went through

814
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,150
经历的一切意义何在呢
the other night even for?

815
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,440
这就意味着现在  我们只需要搞清楚
Which means right now, we just have to figure out

816
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,140
我们愿意付多少钱
how much we're willing to pay.

817
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,750
不  我们不
No, we don't.

818
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,400
哈维  你在说什么
Harvey, what are you saying?

819
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,100
我在说斯坦普尔根本不在乎你们两个
I'm saying Stemple doesn't care about you two.

820
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,040
他只是想和我共处一室看我大出血
He just wants to get in a room with me and see me bleed.

821
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,900
你不能自掏腰包付钱给那个人
You are not paying that man out of your pocket.

822
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,520
-是的  就是这样  -哈维  杰西卡说得对
- Yes, I am. - Harvey, Jessica's right.

823
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,630
不  她说的不对
No, she's not.

824
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,060
我们都知道是我把大家带进这趟浑水的
We all know I got us into this mess.

825
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,980
是时候由我来把我们大家带出来了
It's time for me to get us out of it.

826
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,890
好吧  你想跟他正面交锋  没问题
All right, you want him, you got him.

827
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,920
但你会恨不得把他的头给扯下来
But you're gonna be tempted to rip that man's head off,

828
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,600
而当那种情况出现时  你得克制住
and when that happens, you're not going to do that.

829
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,730
你要付钱给他
You're going to pay him.

830
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,430
然后你就让他从这里滚出去
And then you're going to throw his sorry ass out of here.

831
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,120
哈维  有空聊一下吗
Harvey, do you have a minute?

832
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,530
说快点就有  等下还要见个人
If it's quick. Someone's on their way over.

833
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,580
我想就之前的事跟你道歉
I want to apologize to you about earlier.

834
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,170
你不需要这么做
You don't need to do that.

835
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,170
是的  我需要
Yes, I do.

836
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,850
我知道你在按你觉得最好的方式行事
I know that you're doing what you feel is best.

837
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,800
我只是
I just...

838
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,680
我之前没想到这事会有那么难
I didn't think this was going to be as hard as it is.

839
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,930
对我来说也一样
For me too.

840
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,120
而且不管怎么样
And for what it's worth,

841
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,820
我接受你的建议
I took your advice.

842
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,980
我会把那家伙从那儿弄走
I'm gonna get that guy out of there.

843
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,090
谢谢
Thank you.

844
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,260
瑞秋
Rachel?

845
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,040
他不会有事的
He's gonna be okay.

846
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,050
对于我刚刚在大厅里看到的
Aren't you getting a little long in the tooth

847
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,930
那位美女来说你年纪是不是大了点
for that hottie I just saw in the hall?

848
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,260
开始吧  斯坦普尔  我没心情和你废话
Let's get to it, Stemple, because I'm not in the mood.

849
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,230
多少钱
How much?

850
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,960
什么多少钱
How much what?

851
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,350
要多少钱才能让我保留我的律所
How much to let me have my firm?

852
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,040
你是不是想说我来这里
Do you mean to imply that I'm simply here

853
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,640
就是为了敲你竹杠的
on a mission to extort you?

854
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,620
我们都知道你是来拿我的钱的
Oh, we both know you're here to get my money

855
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,260
这样你就能跟杰克・索罗夫分赃了
so you can split it with Jack Soloff.

856
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,800
你这么小瞧我真让我感到愤慨
I resent that you think so little of me.

857
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,380
你是在说那不是你来这里的原因吗
You saying that's not why you're here?

858
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,400
我是在说我不在乎你的钱
I'm saying I don't give a shit

859
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,220
或者杰克・索罗夫
about your money or Jack Soloff.

860
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,460
我想要你的一部分
I want a piece of you.

861
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:32,530
把你的臭手从那上面挪开
Get your Goddamn hands off that.

862
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,350
哈维  哈维  哈维  放轻松
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey. Relax.

863
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,270
我来这里不是为了把我温柔的双手
I didn't come here to put my gentle hands

864
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,970
放在你宝贵的篮球上的
on your precious balls.

865
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,480
我来这里是为了拿走某样贵重的多的东西
I came here to take something far more valuable.

866
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,360
因为我想要的是那幅该死的鸭子画
'Cause what I want is that piece of shit duck painting.

867
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,360
什么
What?

868
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,470
就那边那幅
That right there.

869
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,350
我猜对了
I was right.

870
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,500
如果那幅画对你不重要  你早就
If that didn't mean something to you, you would have

871
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,490
从椅子上跳起来跟我说没问题了
jumped right out of your chair and said okay to me.

872
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,080
-斯坦普尔  听着  -更不用说
- Stemple, listen-- - Not to mention,

873
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,550
你从我认识你那天起就一直挂着那幅画
you've had that thing as long as I've known you,

874
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,730
而且除非是那副画对你意味着一切  不然
and there's no way a guy like you has a painting like that

875
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,690
像你这样的人是绝对不会挂那样一幅画的
unless it means everything to him.

876
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,940
你要多少钱  斯坦普尔
How much money, Stemple?

877
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,160
因为你是不会得到那副画的
Because you are not getting that painting.

878
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,980
-一千万美元  -艾略特
- $10 million. - Elliott.

879
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,520
-一千五百万  -该死的
- 15 million. - Goddamn it.

880
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,290
两千万  你还想继续吗
20 million. Do you want to keep going?

881
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,850
或者说你想好了吗  因为10秒钟之后
Or have you had enough? Because in ten seconds,

882
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,630
我要么拿两千万走人
I am walking out of here with $20 million

883
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,140
要么拿走那个东西
or that thing in my hands.

884
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,130
不然明早  我就把你的律所置于死地
Or tomorrow morning, I'm putting your firm in the ground.

885
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,760
画是你的了
Take the painting.

886
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,310
我知道你不相信我  但是你看谁来了
I know you don't trust me, but look who's headed this way.

887
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,040
他们过来  大家都要离开
On top of that, people are leaving.

888
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:56,980
你也应该马上走
You should leave, too.

889
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,470
不  那是他想要的
No. That's what he wants.

890
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,750
他想让我离开去一个
He wants me to go somewhere

891
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,980
警卫看不到我的地方
where those guards don't have a view of me.

892
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,260
而且就我知道的  他派你来让我走
And for all I know, he sent you to help him.

893
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,290
你根本不知道你在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

894
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,510
走开
Leave me alone.

895
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,720
你好  迈克
Hey there, Mike.

896
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,640
你在看什么  《局外人》
What you reading? "Outliers"?

897
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,350
我不知道你认为将要发生什么  弗兰克
I don't know what you think is gonna happen here, Frank,

898
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:22,840
但我不会让你骗我离开这个房间
but I'm not gonna let you trick me into leaving this room.

899
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,340
我不需要骗你  这房间就挺好
I don't need to trick you. This room will do just fine.

900
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,750
是吗  那你把这句话
Oh, yeah? Why don't you tell that

901
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,560
跟坐在我后面的两个警卫说
to the two guards sitting behind me?

902
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,800
你指的是那两个让我进你牢房的警卫
You mean the ones who let me into your cell?

903
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,360
他们去抽烟了  迈克
They took a little cigarette break, Mike.

904
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,130
等等  等等  等等  等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

905
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:44,630
所以就这样吗
So that's it?

906
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,060
你打算让这些人杀了我
You're gonna let these guys kill me?

907
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,790
谁说要杀你了
Who said anything about killing you?

908
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,140
我们只是想弄伤你一点  或者很多
We're just gonna hurt you a little, or a lot.

909
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,610
不不不不不  我想说的是
No, no, no, no, no. What I meant was,

910
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,280
你真的胆小到不敢自己面对我
are you really too much of a pussy to take me on by yourself?

911
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,400
你觉得就因为你激了我几句
You think they won't come at you

912
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,660
他们就不会打你了吗
just because you called me out?

913
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,740
不  我想男人都愿意听领导的
Oh, no, I think that men respond to leaders.

914
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,880
你要是太害怕收拾我这样的男人
And if you're too afraid to take on a guy like me,

915
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,960
那你这领导当不久了
you're not gonna be a leader for much longer.

916
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,560
好吧  硬汉
Okay, tough guy.

917
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,510
你想跟我一对一  来吧
You want me one-on-one, you got it.

918
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,480
一个小事  我打算用这个
One little thing: I'm gonna use this

919
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,730
-而他们会按住你  -不不不
- and they're gonna hold you. - No, no, no!

920
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,150
怎么回事
What's going on here?

921
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,260
什么  没事
Huh? What? Nothing.

922
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,470
你也说没事吗
You have the same story?

923
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,300
对
Yeah.

924
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,180
对  什么事都没有
Yeah, nothing's going on here.

925
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,810
那你们三个离他远点
Then why don't you three get away from him,

926
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,460
回你们的牢房去
and go to your cells?

927
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,570
今天晚上我不想看见你们三个
And I don't want to see you back in here

928
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,810
再回这里
for the rest of the night.

929
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,910
我刚才看见斯坦普尔从这离开
I just saw Stemple walking out of here...

930
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,550
手里拿着一幅画跟
with a canvas that looks about the same size

931
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,140
你墙上那块空的大小一样
as that empty space on your wall.

932
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,340
他不会回来了
He won't be back.

933
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,960
所以结束了
So it's done?

934
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,210
结束了
It's done.

935
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,430
哈维
Harvey?

936
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,570
我记得你跟我说过那幅画
I remember you told me that painting

937
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:14,000
是你跟你妈妈唯一的快乐回忆
was the one happy memory you had of your mother before--

938
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,480
像我说的  杰西卡
Like I said, Jessica,

939
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,930
我把大家带入麻烦
I was the one who got us into this mess.

940
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,550
我就必须帮大家摆脱麻烦
I'm the one who needed to get us out of it.

941
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,890
搞定了
It's done.

942
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,080
谢天谢地
Thank God.

943
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,730
所以  你想叫哈维出来
So, you want to go get Harvey?

944
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,960
一起去喝一杯庆祝一下
Have a drink and celebrate?

945
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,330
哈维需要一个人待着  路易
Harvey needs to be alone right now, Louis.

946
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,840
那你跟我去
How about you and me?

947
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,450
我想去
I would,

948
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,720
但是我需要去办一件事
but there's something I need to take care of.

949
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,650
我明白
I understand.

950
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,960
路易  你的想法是对的
Louis, you had the right idea.

951
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,430
但方法错了
The wrong execution.

952
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,120
什么意思
What do you mean?

953
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,730
我的意思是如果我们想看起来像个律所
I mean, if we're going to look like a real firm,

954
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,640
那么从明早开始  我们需要
then starting tomorrow, we need to do something

955
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,480
把这些办公室转租出去
about subletting these offices.

956
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,140
我会处理
I'll take care of it.

957
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,640
我能问你一个问题吗
Can I ask you something?

958
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,520
没问题
Sure.

959
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,680
你为什么带警卫一起回来
Why'd you come back with the guard?

960
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,100
现在加洛知道是你了
Now Gallo knows it was you.

961
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
不论怎样他都会知道是我的
He would have found out it was me anyway.

962
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,480
但我可能不会知道
But I might not have.

963
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,130
我那么做不是为了让你原谅我
I didn't do it to get you to forgive me.

964
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,330
我那么做是因为我
I did it 'cause I never should have

965
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,150
当初就不该让他进来
let him in here in the first place.

966
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,150
笑什么
What?

967
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,600
我才发现我都还不知道你的名字
I just realized that I don't even know your name.

968
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,300
凯文
Kevin.

969
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,870
凯文・米勒
Kevin Miller.

970
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,170
迈克・罗斯
Mike Ross.

971
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,090
谢谢你  凯文
Thank you, Kevin.

972
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,050
关灯了  男士们
Lights out, gentlemen.

973
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,940
罗伯特  我能跟你说几句话吗
Robert, can I talk to you for a second?

974
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,000
说吧  你需要什么
Yeah, what do you need?

975
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,260
我刚才发现我不能
I just found out I'm not going to be able

976
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,870
进律所当合伙人了
to buy in as a partner.

977
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,010
-什么  -我没有那么多钱
- What? - I don't have the money.

978
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,570
而且我在想
And I was wondering--

979
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,020
我不需要一个五十岁的初级律师  杰克
I don't need a 50-year-old associate, Jack.

980
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,170
我知道
I know that.

981
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,290
如果你能让我用薪水付入股的钱
If you could just let me pay it off out of my salary.

982
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,260
你知道我的  我如果这么做了
You know as well as I do,if I let you do that

983
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,750
我就等着所有人都跟我这么要求吧
I might as well waive to buy in for everyone

984
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,130
求你了  罗伯特
Please,Robert.

985
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,590
你为什么不能贷款
Why can't you get a loan for it?

986
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,620
他可以
He can,

987
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,330
但是会有点麻烦
but it's gonna be a little complicated.

988
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,970
因为我打算先贷款给你
Because I'm actually loaning you this money.

989
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,870
你再贷款给他
And you're gonna loan it to him,

990
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,290
这样即使如果没人还钱
and if nobody ever repays anybody,

991
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,050
也没关系
nobody's gonna give a shit.

992
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,110
你为什么要这么做  杰西卡
Why are you doing this,Jessica?

993
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,260
因为是我把你带入这个麻烦的
Because I'm the one that got you into this mess.

994
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,770
我应该帮你摆脱它
I should be the one to get you out.

995
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,340
谢谢
Thank you.

996
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,860
其实吧  杰克
The truth is, Jack,

997
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,230
人越老
the older I get,

998
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,880
就越想多交朋友
the more I'd rather have friends out there

999
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,720
而不是敌人
than enemies.
