00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,390
{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

17
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,440
我来通知你不要再骚扰我的律所
I'm here to tell you you're backing the hell off my firm.

18
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,330
你得签下协议
You got to sign something

19
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,980
声明我与此事无关
saying that I had nothing to do with this.

20
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,700
-我已经签好了  -现在这都是你的担子了
- I already did. - It's on you now.

21
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,990
想看看你未婚妻昨晚给我发的照片吗
You want to see a copy of the pictures your fiancée sent me? 

22
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,200
她没给你发任何东西
She didn't send you anything.

23
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,840
我还复印了好多份  人手一份
I made copies, one for each guy in the joint.

24
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,530
纪念日快乐
Happy anniversary.

25
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,060
和一个
It's so nice to be with a man

26
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,970
听不懂话的男人工作一整天后
who's so thoughtful after spending all day

27
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,950
能和如此体贴的男人共度时光真是太好了
with a man who doesn't even know what the word means.

28
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:21,810
是指哈维
Talking about Harvey.

29
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,620
但如果他要求你离开你热爱的工作
If you can't even separate yourself from him

30
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,390
你却仍无法离开他
when he's asking you to leave a job that you love,

31
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,390
我只能好奇你爱的到底是不是这工作
makes me wonder if it's really the job you love after all.

32
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,470
但我觉得这笔钱的一部分
I was thinking maybe some of that money

33
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,450
可以给你女儿
might go to your daughter.

34
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,540
我知道你和她不来往了
I know you don't talk to her.

35
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,140
如果你这是耍我...
If you're playing with me on this thing--

36
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,390
我没有耍你  弗兰克
I'm not playing you, Frank.

37
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,260
你怎么又和弗兰克・加洛搅在了一起
What the hell are you doing with Frank Gallo?

38
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,330
瑞秋知道这事吗
Does Rachel know about this?

39
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,420
-不知道  -那你最好祈祷
- No. - And you better hope

40
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,750
加洛不会像给我留言这样
Gallo doesn't leave her a message

41
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,030
也去给她留言
the same way he left me one.

42
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,030
亚历克斯被人握住了把柄
Alex has a gun to his head.

43
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,190
我有个办法
I have a way out of it, 

44
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,160
但是对迈克会有不好的影响
but there's gonna be some consequences for Mike.

45
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,780
哈维  还有别的办法吗
Harvey, is there any other way out of this mess?

46
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,570
如果有的话  我不会站在这了
If there were, I wouldn't be standing here.

47
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,940
你认为签下改造公司能解决问题
You think signing Reform Corps. is gonna make this go away,

48
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,070
他们手里有他的把柄
they have something on him.

49
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,220
你有一晚上的时间
Why don't you take the night and decide

50
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,310
来考虑你是否足够相信我  留下  还是走人
if you trust me enough to keep working here or not.

51
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,500
警卫递给我一张纸条
The guard gave me a letter,

52
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,870
那个警卫被犯人杀了
and that guard was murdered by an inmate.

53
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,710
-你掩盖了一场谋杀  -他们陷害我
- You covered up a murder? - They set me up.

54
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,210
我没有让你放下
I'm not asking you to let it go;

55
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,200
而是告诉你如果你不放下的后果
I'm telling you what would happen if you don't.

56
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,310
*看到钱  就愿意留下吃饭*
*See the money, wanna stay for your meal*

57
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,690
*给你太太再拿块馅饼*
*Get another piece of pie for your wife*

58
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,040
*所有人都想知道那感觉*
*Everybody wanna know how it feel*

59
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,350
*所有人都想见见那景象*
*Everybody wanna see what it's like*

60
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,660
*豆子馅饼我也愿吃  我不在乎*
*I'll even eat a bean pie, I don't mind*

61
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,650
*我和妹子忙着赚钱*
*Me and Missy is so busy, busy making money*

62
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,740
*好了*
*All right*

63
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,910
*退开点  我要跳舞*
*All step back, I'm 'bout to dance*

64
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,620
{\an8}诉讼双雄 第七季 第八集

65
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,620
*美钞爵士摇摇摇*
*The greenback boogie*

66
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,400
-抱歉  你是谁来着  -我懂了
- I'm sorry, who's this? - I get it.

67
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,660
我这几天没回你电话
I haven't returned your calls for a few days.

68
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,870
-既然你说起来了  -我很抱歉
- Now that you mention it-- - Listen, I'm sorry.

69
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,910
这几天办公室情况一直很紧急
I've been totally under the gun at the office,

70
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,560
但现在应该脱离危险了
but I think we're out of the woods.

71
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,250
那你弥补我一下吧
Then how about you make it up to me

72
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,910
让我请你吃饭
by letting me take you out to dinner?

73
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,100
周四晚上
Thursday night.

74
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,350
我理理清楚
Let me get this straight.

75
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,190
我忙于工作
I get caught up with work

76
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,270
对我的惩罚就是你请我吃饭
and my punishment is you taking me out.

77
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,730
我是英国人  哈维
I'm British, Harvey.

78
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,420
我们大洋对岸的人做事方式不一样
We do things differently across the pond.

79
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,040
那我们周四见了
Then I guess I'll see you Thursday.

80
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,010
好啊  晚安  哈维
I guess you will. Good night, Harvey.

81
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,150
晚安  宝拉
Good night, Paula.

82
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,240
-你好  -马克  你好
- Hello? - Mark, hi.

83
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,140
我是唐娜・保尔森
It's Donna Paulson.

84
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,100
唐娜
Donna.

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,980
这...
It's, uh...

86
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,140
接到你的电话真好  好久没联系了
good to hear from you. It's been a long time.

87
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,980
是啊  我...
Yeah. I was, um--

88
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,690
我刚好想起了你
I was just thinking about you and I...

89
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,710
就决定打个电话
decided to give you a call.

90
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,520
那太好了
I'm--I'm glad you did. 

91
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,100
我也会时不时想起你
You know, I think about you from time to time, too.

92
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,610
-好奇怪啊  -是吗
- This is weird. - Oh, I don't know.

93
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,530
前女友突然深夜来电
Ex-girlfriend calling, out of the blue, late night.

94
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,950
-我见过更怪的  -是吗
- I think I've seen weirder. - Oh, have you.

95
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,270
虽然现在一时想不起来
Well, nothing I can think of this second,

96
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,660
但我肯定见过的
but I'm sure I have.

97
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,740
不如在你想的时候
Well, while you're thinking about it,

98
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,620
顺便看看日历
why don't you check your calendar

99
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,540
能不能挤出点时间跟我吃顿饭
and see if you can squeeze me in for lunch sometime soon.

100
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,270
我不用看日历
I don't have to check my calendar.

101
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,310
我随时都能挤出时间见你
I'm pretty sure I can squeeze you in any time.

102
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,790
-那明天怎么样  -明天就不错
- Then how's tomorrow? - Tomorrow sounds good.

103
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,760
就去老地方
The, uh, place with the thing by the thing?

104
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,950
老地方就好
The place with the thing by the thing sounds good.

105
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,550
到时见
See you there.

106
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,080
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

107
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,360
我叫你想一晚了
I told you to take the night.

108
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,590
我不需要想一晚
I don't need to take the night.

109
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,130
我需要马上跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you right now.

110
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,120
如果你是来叫我放弃改造公司
If you're here to tell me to drop Reform Corp.,

111
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,020
-那你白来  -我不是为那个来的  哈维
- you've wasted a trip-- - I'm not here for that, Harvey.

112
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,490
亚历克斯什么都告诉我了
Alex told me everything.

113
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,870
证明给我看
Prove it.

114
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,580
我发誓  你要是敢用这个对付他
I swear to God, if you're gonna use this against him--

115
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,870
我不想拿什么对付他
I don't wanna use anything against him.

116
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,450
-我想帮他  -扯淡
- I wanna help him. - Bullshit.

117
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,000
不是扯淡  我听了他的故事
It's not bullshit. I listened to his story.

118
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,340
任何人都可能处于那样的境地
Anyone could've found themselves in that position.

119
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,530
你什么意思
So what are you saying? 

120
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,820
我是意思是  我们本该是蝙蝠侠和罗宾的
I'm saying that you and I are supposed to be Batman and Robin, we--

121
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,340
要是我们不能阻止他们逍遥法外
If we can't stop these guys from getting away with it

122
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,820
并同时拯救亚历克斯
and save Alex in the meantime,

123
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,120
那我们还在干什么
then what the hell are we doing?

124
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,750
我猜你有计划了
I'm guessing you got a plan.

125
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,320
我猜我有
I'm guessing I do.

126
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,070
你觉得我们需要找到我们的戈登警长
You think we need to find our Commissioner Gordon.

127
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,030
-你怎么知道的  -因为我了解蝙蝠侠
- How'd you know that? - Because I know Batman.

128
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,340
我知道他需要一个内应
And I know that he needs someone on the inside

129
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,010
跟他在幕后合作
who's working with him behind the scenes.

130
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,040
瞧瞧你啊  你真的很了解蝙蝠侠
Look at you. You do know Batman.

131
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,200
-你有人选了吗  -当然
- You got someone in mind? - Of course I do.

132
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,820
除非你比你看上去得还要蠢
Unless you're even dumber than you look,

133
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,680
你现在也在想着这人
it's the same person you're thinking of.

134
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,260
罗伯特  有时间吗
Robert, you have a minute?

135
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,030
我有时间搞清楚你是怎么进入我家的
I got a minute to find out how you got into my house.

136
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,280
劳拉让我进来的
Laura let me in.

137
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,050
当然了
Yeah, of course she did.

138
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,780
她不知为何误认为你挺有魅力
She's under the misguided impression that you're charming.

139
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,970
告诉我你盒子里装了什么吧
Now why don't you tell me what you got in that box.

140
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,040
就是些文件
Just some files. 

141
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,080
我们公司要没地方了
We were running out of space over at my firm

142
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,080
我想在你这儿放一些
and I thought maybe I could just store them with you.

143
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,910
你以为我没听说那起集体诉讼吗
You think I didn't hear about that class action?

144
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,710
差点搞得你们内部分裂
Just about cracked your firm in two?

145
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,840
我为什么要碰那玩意
Why the hell would I touch that with a ten foot pole?

146
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,470
罗伯特  我没有任何立场
Robert, I don't have a leg to stand on

147
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,490
只能说迈克接下了案子
other than to say that Mike took this on

148
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,730
而且发现了可怕的事实
and found some bad shit.

149
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,500
我要给你个机会纠正错误
I'm giving you an opportunity to right some wrongs,

150
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,600
赚大钱
make a shitload of money

151
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,880
而你只需要去参加一次会面
and all you have to do is show up for one meeting.

152
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,220
我这里可能还有点放东西的地方
I think I might have some extra storage space here.

153
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,450
但是  哈维  如果你把那些东西交给我
But, Harvey, if you leave that thing with me,

154
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,950
案子就是我的了  我会按自己的方式来
the case is mine and I run it how I see fit.

155
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,490
-这是威胁吗  -或许吧  或许不是
- Is that a threat? - Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

156
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,830
但一旦我们上了场
But once we step into that ring,

157
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,870
我才不在乎你是谁
I don't give a shit who you are,

158
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,650
我是不会放水的
I'm not pulling my punches.

159
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,270
正合我意
I wouldn't have it any other way.

160
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,670
怎么回事  我以为你是我这边的
What the hell? I thought you were on my side.

161
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,490
我是你这边的
I am on your side. 

162
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,420
那罗伯特・赞恩怎么突然冒出来
Then why did Robert Zane just come out of nowhere 

163
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,120
要重启那件案子
and all of a sudden reopen that God damn case? 

164
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,180
亚历克斯  放松
Alex, relax.

165
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,620
他重启不是针对你的客户
He didn't open it up against your client;

166
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,810
而是哈维的客户
he opened it up against Harvey's.

167
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,060
那有什么用
What good does that do?

168
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,840
他们是合伙的  我也是
They're in this thing together and so am I.

169
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,800
听我说  你把真相告诉了我
Listen to me. You've trusted me with the truth.

170
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,680
我向你保证了我不会让你为你
I gave you my word that I wouldn't let you go down

171
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
没做的事锒铛入狱
for something you didn't do. 

172
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,290
看来你的保证一文不值
Well I guess your word is shit

173
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,730
因为庭审一开始
because the second this trial starts,

174
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,620
我背后迟早要背上靶眼
it's only a matter of time till I've got a bull's-eye on my back. 

175
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,120
那幸好不会有庭审了
Well, then I guess it's a good thing there isn't gonna be a trial.

176
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,720
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

177
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,740
我不能把一切都告诉你
I can't tell you everything that's going on,

178
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,340
但你只需要确保
but all you need to do is make sure

179
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,350
马斯特森建筑公司不会插手
Masterson Construction stands down.

180
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,720
之后  你只需要悠闲地看着整件事解决
After that, you just sit back and watch this whole thing go away.

181
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,150
该死
God damn it!

182
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,070
该死  格蕾琴
God damn it, Gretchen,

183
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,630
我几天前就叫你准备斯特芬妮接替人的申请了
I asked you for those applications to replace Stephanie days ago.

184
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,580
-在哪...  -在这里
- Where the hell-- - I have them right here.

185
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,900
为什么你不给我
Well, why didn't you give them to me?

186
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,630
因为有个问题...
Because there was a problem--

187
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,570
等等
Wait a second.

188
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,590
-感觉不对  -你怎么知道
- This doesn't feel right. - How can you know that?

189
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,950
因为涉及到申请  我就是天才
Because when it comes to applications, I'm like Rain Man

190
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,810
感觉少一份申请
and this pile feels one applicant light.

191
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,610
因为哥伦比亚大学选择了
That's because Columbia University

192
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,870
不推荐申请人
chose not to send an applicant.

193
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,090
为什么你不告诉我
Well, why the hell didn't you tell me?

194
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,670
因为这只是一个职位
Because it's one position. 

195
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,730
我们有其它19个排名前20学校的申请  傻子
We have applications from 19 of the top 20 schools, you fool.

196
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,850
-你刚叫我傻子吗  -我看见就叫
- Did you just call me a fool? - I call 'em like I see 'em.

197
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,640
我不管其它19个怎样
Well, I don't give a shit about the other 19

198
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,900
即使有一个认为
if there's even one 

199
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,070
在迈克・罗斯事件后我们不够好
that thinks we're still not good enough after Mike Ross.

200
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,160
我也不会坐视不管
I'm not gonna let it stand.

201
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,270
路易  如果你过去找麻烦
Louis, if you go over there and make trouble,

202
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,810
就不会只是哥大不送律师过来
it won't only be Columbia withholding lawyers from us, 

203
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,560
而是全国的所有大学
it'll be every damn school in the country.

204
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,800
格蕾琴  如果你还说个没完
Gretchen, if you're gonna keep talking, 

205
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,960
就对着我的屁股讲吧
you might as well say it to my ass 

206
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,310
因为我现在就要过去
'cause I'm going over there right now

207
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,140
让他们知道谁配不上谁
to let them know who's too good for who.

208
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,940
-罗杰  -怎么回事
- Roger. - What the hell?

209
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,410
-什么怎么回事  -别装
- What the hell, what? - Don't give me that.

210
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,810
我做了些调查
I did a little digging.

211
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,480
罗伯特・赞恩就要成为迈克・罗斯的岳父了
Robert Zane is about to be Mike Ross' father-in-law

212
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,780
我不觉得这是个巧合
and I don't think it's a coincidence

213
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,040
突然间他就同一个案子找上我们
that all of a sudden, he's coming after us on the exact same case.

214
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,530
罗杰  我会处理的
Roger, I'll take care of it.

215
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,270
你最好处理  哈维
You better take care of it, Harvey.

216
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,590
因为我同意协议的唯一原因
Because I only signed with you

217
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,340
是你保证过阻止迈克・罗斯
because you promised to stop Mike Ross,

218
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,280
我想我不用提醒你
and I don't think I have to remind you

219
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,090
如果改造公司完了
that if Reform Corp. goes down,

220
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,650
亚历克斯・威廉姆斯就完了
Alex Williams goes down

221
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,640
带着你整个律所也就完了
and he takes your whole damn firm with him.

222
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,410
我告诉过你我会解决的
I told you. I'll take care of it.

223
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,520
但是你要为我做些事情
But you're gonna need to do something for me.

224
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,860
-是什么  -打开你的支票本
- And what is that? - Open your god damn checkbook.

225
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,240
罗伯特  你没必要这么和我的委托人说话
Robert, there's no cause for you to talk to my client like that. 

226
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,920
如果你想让我邀请他喝下午茶  可以
Well, if you want me to invite him to afternoon tea, I will.

227
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,450
但是如果想结了这个案子
But if he wants this case to go away, 

228
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,270
这就是他要给的金额
this is how much he's gonna have to pay.

229
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,400
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

230
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,060
罗伯特  这不是和解提议
Robert, this isn't a settlement offer.

231
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,440
这是战书
This is a declaration of war.

232
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,790
那我们开战吧
Then let's go to war.

233
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,960
你觉得我会害怕陪审团吗
You think I'm afraid to put this in front of a jury?

234
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,680
你不会见到陪审团
You won't get near a jury

235
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,740
因为我会确保他们知道迈克・罗斯
'cause I'm gonna make sure they know Mike Ross

236
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,600
双手给你奉上这个案子
handed you this case on a silver platter.

237
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,870
你没有证据
And you don't have the proof of that

238
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,350
不然你不会出现在和解谈判
or you wouldn't be at a settlement meeting.

239
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,740
但我有证据证明
But I do have the proof 

240
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,970
你不仅阴谋延长刑期
that you not only schemed to extend sentences,

241
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,810
还杀人掩盖
but murdered someone to cover it up.

242
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,620
你说什么
What are you talking about? 

243
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,830
我有一个在监狱的证人
I'm talking about the fact that I have an eyewitness in prison 

244
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,590
会出庭作证
who'll testify in court.

245
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,700
证人是谁
And who is this witness?

246
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,060
你知道他是谁
You know who he is.

247
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,740
而且他也知道你是谁
And he knows who you are.

248
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,050
除非接受我的条件
And unless you take my deal,

249
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,200
否则你只能等着进监狱了
you're gonna end up behind bars yourself.

250
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,370
我不会付这么多钱
I am not paying that kind of money

251
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,370
也不会承认任何事
and I am not admitting to anything.

252
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,910
罗杰  你听到了  他有个证人
Roger, you heard him. He has a witness.

253
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,240
那你最好确保弗兰克・加洛不能作证  哈维
Then you better make sure Frank Gallo doesn't testify, Harvey.

254
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,850
不然我就找别人
Or I'll find somebody who can.

255
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,100
我要和管招聘的人说话
I wanna speak to whoever the hell's in charge of recruiting

256
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,270
就现在
and I wanna speak to them now.

257
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,880
恐怕不行
Well, I'm afraid that's not possible.

258
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,260
不行是什么意思
What do you mean it's not possible?

259
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,000
你必须要预约
I mean you'll have to make an appointment.

260
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,800
我们不接受临时来访
We don't take in walk-ins.

261
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,330
我不是临时来访
Well, I'm not a walk-in.

262
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,570
我是路易・利特
My name is Louis Litt,

263
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,310
皮-斯-利律所的
from the firm Pearson Specter Litt.

264
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,220
-等等  你不能进去  -我可以
- Wait, you can't go in there. - Oh, yes I can.

265
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,760
如果你们这种人认为可以除名我们律所
If you people think you can dismiss our firm,

266
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,370
那你们就是疯...
you have another thing com--

267
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,950
-希拉  -路易
- Sheila. - Louis.

268
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,110
你怎么在这里
What are you doing here?

269
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,410
我在哥大工作六个月了
well, I've worked at Columbia for the past six months.

270
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,810
但你说过你绝不会离开哈佛
But you said you would never leave Harvard.

271
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,830
我说过  路易
I did, Louis.

272
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,950
-但是...  -但是什么
- But-- - But what?

273
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,630
我的未婚夫住在纽约  我想和他一起
My fiancé lives in the city and I wanted to be with him.

274
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,730
-未婚夫  -是的
- Fiancé. - Yes.

275
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,440
我们两周后结婚
We're getting married in two weeks.

276
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,510
-抱歉  路易  -你没必要道歉
- I'm sorry, Louis. - You don't need to be sorry.

277
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,060
我理解你为什么没有送申请
And I understand why you didn't send the applications over.

278
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,290
-你不想让我受伤  -是的
You didn't want me to be hurt. - I didn't.

279
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,750
但现在你知道了
But now that you know, 

280
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,030
也就没有理由惩罚你或者律所了
there's no reason to punish you or the firm.

281
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,250
我同意
I guess not.

282
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,740
我会送去我们最好最聪明的学生
I'll send over our best and our brightest

283
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,210
确保他们知道这是一个向行业
and make sure they understand it's an opportunity

284
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,370
最优者学习的机会
to learn at the foot of a master.

285
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,560
很高兴见到你  希拉
It's good to see you, Sheila.

286
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,180
很高兴见到你  路易
Good to see you too, Louis.

287
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,970
哈维  发生了什么  他们同意了吗
Harvey, what happened? They go for it?

288
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,560
你背后捅刀子的岳父
What happened was your backstabbing father-in-law

289
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,980
毁了和解
blew up the settlement.

290
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,950
-什么  为什么  -因为他混蛋
- What? Why? - 'Cause he's an asshole.

291
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,240
现在我得阻止加洛作证
Now I gotta stop Gallo from testifying.

292
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,630
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

293
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,660
我在说我要去监狱
I'm talking about going to the prison

294
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,010
说服那个疯子不开口
and convincing that psychopath not to talk.

295
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,590
-哈维  这是个坏主意  -你不明白吗
- Harvey, that's a bad idea. - Don't you get it?

296
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,290
他开口  亚历克斯就完了
He talks, Alex goes down.

297
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,550
这正是我们要避免的
That's the whole thing we're trying to avoid.

298
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,730
我不是说让加洛闭嘴
I'm not saying it's a bad idea

299
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,750
是个坏主意
to shut Gallo down.

300
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,410
我是说不应该你去
I'm saying that you are not the one to do it. 

301
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,620
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

302
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,330
你不能接近这个案子
You're not supposed to be anywhere near this case.

303
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,820
钥匙让改造公司听到风声...
Reform Corp. Gets wind of this--

304
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,860
他们能怎样  哈维
And what, Harvey?

305
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,220
我把对方的明星证人给搞定了
I shut down the star witness on the other side.

306
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,660
他们非但不生气  还会用奖牌犒劳我
They're not gonna be pissed. They're gonna give me a medal.

307
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,340
你凭什么认为这事你做的会比我好
What makes you think you're gonna be better at that than me? 

308
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,720
因为  他延长刑期是因为我
Because I might've been the one who kept him there longer, 

309
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,580
但一开始让他入狱的是你
but you-- you're the one who put him there in the first place.

310
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,690
你怎么来了  不是退出这案子了吗
what are you doing here? I thought you were off the case. 

311
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,590
没错
I was.

312
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,310
但我又接手了
Now I'm back on.

313
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,370
因为我有东西要给你
'Cause I need to give you something.

314
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,820
好吧  什么东西
Yeah, what's this?

315
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,930
这笔钱要比罗伯特・赞恩
It's a hell of a lot more than whatever

316
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,280
雇你来作证所得的要多的多
Robert Zane is paying you to testify.

317
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,910
你女儿仍能拿到
It's on top of whatever settlement

318
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,600
之前协议的要求
your daughter is still gonna get.

319
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,250
你只需要三缄其口
All you have to do is keep your mouth shut.

320
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,970
你的钱对我没有吸引力了
Yeah, I'm not interested in your money.

321
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,350
不  加洛  你不懂  这...
No, Gallo, you're not getting me, this--

322
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,640
是你不懂
You're not getting me. 

323
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,290
我根本不在乎你的钱
I don't give a God damn about your money.

324
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,200
罗伯特・赞恩告诉我了
Robert Zane already told me 

325
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,780
你还会回来想办法害我
you'd be in here trying to screw me over.

326
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,000
我没想害你
I'm not trying to screw you over. 

327
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,450
那你上个月为什么一直在要我做
Then why have you been trying to get me to do 

328
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,770
-和现在要求相反的事  -因为
- the exact opposite thing for the last month? - Because--

329
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,890
因为你们俩只在乎
Because the two of you don't give a shit

330
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,720
各自利益
about anything but yourselves.

331
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,590
情况有变
The situation has changed.

332
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,710
你知道什么没变吗
You know what hasn't changed?

333
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,300
丹妮斯
Denise.

334
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,190
她对我的看法
What she thinks of me.

335
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,040
-弗兰克  这  -你看  你之前来这
- Frank, that's-- - See, you came in here

336
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,770
想让我把她的爱买回来
trying to get me to buy her love back.

337
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,010
我差点就做了
I almost did it.

338
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,700
但是光用钱我从她那什么也得不到
But I can't get anything from her with just money.

339
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,370
我得让她看我站在证人席
I need her to see me get up on that stand

340
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,080
承认我犯的错并且请求原谅
admit what I did and ask for forgiveness.

341
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,490
罗伯特・赞恩理解我  因为他也有女儿
Robert Zane understands that because he's got a daughter.

342
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,490
-我能理解  -不  你不能
- I understand that-- - No, you don't.

343
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,160
我得让她看见我的行动
I need her to see me do this.

344
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,750
你和哈维说什么也不能改变我的心意
And nothing you or Harvey can say is gonna change that.

345
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,330
然后你说
And then you said,

346
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,170
"是笨蛋先生  非常感谢"
"It's Mr. Dipshit, thank you very much."

347
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,610
如果他在
Well, if he's gonna be a stickler

348
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,530
预订姓名问题上继续纠缠...
about what name is on the reservation...

349
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,340
那一周剩下的时间
And then for the rest of the weekend,

350
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,840
我们一杯酒钱都没付过
we didn't have to pay for a single drink.

351
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,390
这是件好事  鉴于你给饭店所有人
Which was a good thing because you ordered tequila shots

352
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,980
-都点了龙舌兰酒  -当时是五月五日节
- for everyone in the restaurant. - It was Cinco de Mayo.

353
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,980
{\an8}为庆祝墨西哥军队击败法国殖民军而设立

354
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,280
当时是八月九日
It was August 9th.

355
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,260
我没想到你还记得
I can't believe you still remember that.

356
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,040
那段时间的很多事我都记得
I remember a lot of things about those days.

357
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,970
所以我都不敢相信
Which is why I can't believe that there's not a, uh,

358
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,290
你至今都没结婚
a Mr. Donna Paulson yet. 

359
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,880
你知道我有自己的标准
Well. You know I have my standards.

360
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,050
我很高兴你没有放低要求
Well, I'm glad to see you haven't lowered them.

361
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,160
实话告诉你  我要求还变高了
To tell you the truth, I actually raised them.

362
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,410
至少是在工作方面
At least professionally.

363
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,130
你是说你终于不给哈维打工了吗
You mean you finally stopped working for Harvey?

364
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,510
是也不是
Yes and no.

365
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,090
我还在律所工作  但现在是首席运营官
I still work at the firm, but I'm COO now.

366
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,530
-唐娜  这太棒了  -确实是
- Donna, that is fantastic. - It is.

367
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,810
那你呢
So what about you?

368
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,900
还没结婚吗
No Mrs. Meadows yet?

369
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,150
事实上  我...
Um, actually, I--

370
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,420
我三年前就结婚了
I got married about three years ago.

371
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,020
马克  如果你已婚
Mark, if you're married, 

372
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,910
为什么要同意和我出来吃饭
why did you agree to have lunch with me?

373
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,440
因为你打电话来邀请我
Because you called and you invited me

374
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,730
而且  我以为只是顿午饭而已...
and--and I thought it's just lunch, and--

375
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,180
你心里清楚这不是普通的午餐会面
This hasn't felt like just lunch and you know it.

376
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,840
的确不是
No, it hasn't.

377
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,150
老实告诉你
To tell you the truth,

378
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,490
我一直都在想你
I think about you all the time.

379
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,190
我妻子和我已经
And my wife and I have been

380
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,000
吵了几个月的架了
at each other's throats for months.

381
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,070
然后你电话就来了  我想着见见你
And then you called and I thought that I would meet you

382
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,190
看看会发生什么
and just see what happened.

383
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,330
我可以告诉你不会发生什么
Well, I can tell you what's not gonna happen.

384
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,360
你的婚姻问题不能通过我来解决
I'm not gonna be the answer to your problems.

385
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,390
我很抱歉
Well, I'm--I'm so sorry.

386
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,050
听着  我不会谎称
Look, I'm not gonna lie

387
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,930
我从来没想过你
and say that I don't think about you, too, from time to time.

388
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,690
我想过
I do.

389
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,150
但是我们俩不能以这种方式重新开始
But this can't be the way that things start up again with us.

390
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,790
所以如果某个时刻  你打电话告诉我  
So if at some point, you call and you say

391
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,710
你和你妻子已经结束了
that things are over between you and your wife

392
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,230
你想和我在一起
and you wanna go out with me,

393
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,060
这个我可以接受
I'd be open to that.

394
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,040
但是现在不行
But I'm not open to this.

395
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,930
我理解
I understand.

396
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,120
很高兴见到你  马克
It was good to see you, Mark.

397
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,160
我也是  唐娜
It's good to see you too, Donna.

398
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,460
瑞秋
Rachel.

399
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,950
你好
Hey.

400
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,430
-见到你真高兴  -是吗
- You are a sight for sore eyes. - Am I?

401
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,700
怎么了
Whoa, what's going on?

402
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,500
今天不顺吗
Did you have a bad day? 

403
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,460
我本来挺好的直到我发现
I was actually having a great day until I found out

404
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,620
谋杀案的证人是弗兰克・加洛
that the witness in the murder case is Frank Gallo.

405
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,050
-瑞秋  我准备  -告诉我吗
- Rachel, I was gonna-- - Gonna tell me?

406
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,340
什么时候  等事情结束以后吗
When, exactly? When the whole thing was over?

407
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,040
因为我还发现你和哈维
Because I also found out that you and Harvey

408
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,590
去找我爸把这个案子接下来了
went to my dad to keep this thing alive.

409
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,970
-瑞秋  -我告诉你
- Rachel-- - How many times

410
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,500
多少次了  我能照顾好我自己
do I have to tell you I can take care of myself?

411
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,470
你想让我说什么
What did you want me to say?

412
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,810
我不应该去找加洛
That I shouldn't have gone to Gallo?

413
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,570
还是我当初就不该
Or that I shouldn't have taken this whole thing on

414
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,340
接下这个案子
in the first place?

415
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,090
因为我不会这么说的
Because I am never gonna say that.

416
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,430
跟这些没关系
This has nothing to do with any of that.

417
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,450
而是你对我作为律师的尊重
This has to do with you respecting me as a lawyer.

418
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
所以你是说如果我把计划告诉你
So you're telling me that if I had let you in on the plan,

419
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,940
你觉得就没有问题了
you would've been good with all of it.

420
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,120
我是不知道我会不会同意你的这些做法
I don't know if I would've been good with any of it.

421
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,110
我知道的是你得明白
What I do know is that you need to get through your head

422
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,480
我是个成年女性
that I am a grown woman

423
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,340
不是什么被困少女
and that I am not a damsel in distress

424
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,680
需要保护
that needs protecting.

425
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,450
无论是什么事  唐娜  我现在都没法考虑
Whatever it is, Donna, I don't have it in me.

426
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,710
没事  路易  我都不知道你在这
It's okay, Louis. I didn't even know you were up here.

427
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,600
如果你想一个人待着  我可以...
If you wanna be alone, I can

428
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,360
希拉要结婚了
Sheila's getting married.

429
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,560
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

430
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,300
她不想告诉我因为她觉得
She didn't wanna tell me because she thought

431
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,380
我接受不了
I couldn't handle it.

432
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,310
我明白
I get it.

433
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,290
也许
Maybe.

434
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,860
但是你不知道的是
But what you don't get is what it's like

435
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,450
在一年内发现两次
to find out twice in one year

436
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,180
你觉得是你一生所爱的人并不想要你
that the person you thought was the love of your life

437
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,110
是什么样的感觉
doesn't want you.

438
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,060
我比你想的更明白这种感受
I understand that more than you think.

439
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,560
什么意思
What do you mean?

440
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,300
我今天和我的一个前男友一起吃了午饭
I had lunch with an ex-boyfriend today.

441
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,080
一个我特别在意的人
Someone I cared a lot about.

442
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,160
我找了他  想知道是否还有可能
I looked him up, wondering if there was still something there

443
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,240
当我们吃饭的时候  他告诉我他结婚了
and while we were eating, he told me he was married.

444
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,130
那他为什么要和你一起吃饭
Why'd he have lunch with you?

445
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,590
因为  路易
Because, Louis.

446
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,180
人们比你所想的要更复杂
People are more complicated than you think.

447
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,550
对于希拉来说并不复杂
Well, it's not complicated for Sheila.

448
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,750
她找到了她的真命天子  就那样
She's found her man, and that is that.

449
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,830
路易  我不确定我放心
Louis, I'm not sure I feel comfortable leaving you

450
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,050
留你一个人在这里
up here all alone.

451
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,860
没事的  唐娜  我不会跳下去的
It's okay, Donna. I'm not gonna jump.

452
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,230
除非你能保证我会落在希拉的未婚夫身上
Unless you can guarantee me I can land on Sheila's fiancé.

453
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,010
好  你会没事的
Okay. You're gonna be all right.

454
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,620
但是我还是不打算留你一个人在这
But I'm still not leaving you up here all alone.

455
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,990
无论你想说什么  我都不想听
Whatever it is, I don't need to hear it

456
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,360
因为我已经知道你要说什么了
because I already know what you're gonna say.

457
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,690
不管怎样我都要说
Well, I'm gonna say it anyway.

458
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,900
我把案子给你不是让你去打官司的
I didn't bring you this case to take you to court.

459
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,010
我给你这个案子是为了让你为这些人伸张正义
I brought it to you so you could give these people justice.

460
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,760
扯淡  你把这个案子给我
Bullshit. You brought it to me

461
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,020
是为了解决你自己的问题
to get you out of hot water.

462
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,900
正如我告诉你的
And like I already told you,

463
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,410
这是我的案子
this is my case.

464
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,560
你没权利告诉我怎么处理
Don't you dare tell me how to run it.

465
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,500
我知道  罗伯特  但是
I know that Robert, but look,

466
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,950
如果你挖得太深
if you dig too deep,

467
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,150
我的人会因为他
it's gonna end up putting one of my own

468
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,100
没犯过的罪而坐牢
behind bars for a crime he didn't commit.

469
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,750
用脚趾头想都知道你说的是谁
Well, it doesn't take too much for me to guess who that is.

470
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,430
我一点也不在乎亚历克斯・威廉姆斯
And I don't give a shit about Alex Williams.

471
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,140
你知道我在乎什么吗
You know what I do give a shit about?

472
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,390
美国有全世界百分之五的人口
The United States is 5% of the world's population.

473
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,450
但却有全世界四分之一的囚犯
But it's got 25% of its prisoners.

474
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,440
但那不是你们这些白人所在乎的
But that's not something you white guys want to talk about.

475
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,840
-罗伯特  -我在哈莱姆
- Robert-- - I grew up

476
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,500
最恶劣的地方长大
in the roughest part of Harlem there is.

477
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,970
我街区的孩子  十之八九
Nine out of ten kids on my block

478
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,380
蹲了监狱
ended up in places like that.

479
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,110
我活着的每一天
And every day of my life,

480
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,950
都在想
I think...

481
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,870
他们只能自求多福
there but by the grace of God.

482
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,010
他们把这些孩子
And they're taking these kids--

483
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,560
像我认识的那些孩子一样  他们
like the ones I knew- and they're

484
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,940
延长他们的刑期  还杀掉了几个
extending their sentences and murdering some of them.

485
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,630
所以无论你要说些什么  做些什么
So no matter what you do or what you say,

486
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,280
他们都会接受我的提议  上庭讨个公道的
they're going to take my offer or we're going to trial.

487
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,840
不管怎样  他们都会付出代价
Either way, they're gonna pay.

488
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,530
哈维  我正想要打给你
Harvey. I was just about to call you.

489
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,660
既然你还没打
Since you didn't already,

490
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,670
我想你没搞定加洛
I'm guessing you couldn't convince Gallo

491
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,910
不去作证
not to testify.

492
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,240
他不要钱  哈维
He doesn't want our money, Harvey.

493
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,680
他想要他女儿原谅他
He wants his daughter's forgiveness

494
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,910
他觉得让他女儿原谅他的唯一方式就是去作证
and thinks the only way he's gonna get it is by testifying.

495
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,250
扯淡  他有所求
Bullshit. He wants something.

496
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,550
我们只需要弄清楚他想要什么
We just need to find out what it is.

497
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,720
听我说  我和他面对面谈了
Listen to me. I was in the room with him.

498
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,840
他想要得到他女儿的原谅是真的
This thing with his daughter is real.

499
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,170
-他不会退缩的  -该死
- He's not gonna back down. - Son of a bitch.

500
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,690
-我们现在做什么  -没办法的办法
- What are we gonna do now? - I hate to say it.

501
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,520
我们可能得找找赞恩的把柄
We may need to find some dirt on Zane.

502
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,350
哈维  我是不会因为一件起初由我们
Harvey, I'm not gonna blackmail my future father-in-law

503
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,600
给他的案子敲诈我未来的岳父的
about a case that we gave him to begin with.

504
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,420
不是你给他的  是我给的
You didn't give it to him. I did.

505
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,420
我这么做是为了确保两件事
And I did it to make sure two things happened,

506
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,900
其中一件就是救亚历克斯・威廉姆斯
and one was saving Alex Williams.

507
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,920
所以如果你不愿意去找赞恩的把柄
So if you don't wanna find something on Zane,

508
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,780
我去找
I will.

509
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,340
你们俩都不用去找
Neither one of you has to.

510
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:39,260
-瑞秋  -哈维  我懂这些事情
- Rachel-- - Harvey, I know how things work.

511
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,670
我是说  你不用去找
I meant, you don't have to find

512
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,140
我爸的把柄  因为我知道
dirt on my father because I know

513
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,320
怎么阻止弗兰克・加洛作证
how to stop Frank Gallo from testifying.

514
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,210
但我爸不会是唯一一个不喜欢这做法的人
But my dad isn't gonna be the only one who doesn't like it.

515
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,770
你俩也不会喜欢的
You two aren't gonna like it either.

516
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,050
-为什么  -因为这涉及到
- Why not? - Because it involves

517
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,640
通过我
impugning his integrity

518
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,910
质疑他的人品
and doing it through me.

519
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,340
如果你说的和我理解的一样
If you're saying what I think you're saying,

520
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,660
那是在玩火
that's playing with fire.

521
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,260
我说过我不介意玩火
And I already told you I don't have a problem playing with fire.

522
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,000
我介意的是被排除在外
My problem is being left out of the game.

523
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,830
所以如果我爸有问题
So if my dad has an issue with it,

524
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,190
让他来找我
you tell him to take it up with me.

525
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,060
路易  那个哥伦比亚大学的女人
Louis, that woman from Columbia University's

526
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,190
又打来了
on the line again.

527
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,550
她想知道你怎么看她的学生
She'd like to know what you thought about her candidate.

528
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,990
告诉她我们已经雇了人了
Tell her we already filled the position.

529
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,900
路易  告诉我怎么了
Louis, tell me what's going on.

530
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,390
你费了那么大的劲让他们参与进来
You went all the way over there to get them on board

531
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,570
现在你却让我和那个女人说谎
and now you're asking me to lie to this woman.

532
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,500
事实是我不想看到她
What's going on is I don't wanna see her,

533
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,710
我不想和她说话  我不想听到她的名字
I don't wanna talk to her, I don't wanna hear her name.

534
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,340
所以如果你不想说谎的话  那就别说
So if you don't wanna lie, then don't.

535
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,200
但是我是不会接那个电话的
But I am not taking that call.

536
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,250
迈克  瑞秋的计划是可行的
Look, Mike, Rachel's plan could work,

537
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,130
但是肯定会气坏赞恩的  你知道的
but it's gonna piss Zane off and you know it.

538
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,740
更不用说对加洛的影响
Not to mention what it's gonna do to Gallo.

539
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,810
相信我  瑞秋和我可以解决好这次的争执的
Rachel and I can take care of the fallout, trust me.

540
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,040
在你昨天晚上来之前
Before you got there last night,

541
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,140
她明确说她能照顾好自己
she made it clear that she can handle herself.

542
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,420
我不在乎她认为自己能照顾谁
Yeah, I don't care what she thinks she can handle.

543
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,680
-我不会这样做  -那你的计划是什么
- I'm not doing it. - Then what exactly is your plan,

544
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,870
听证会五分钟后就开始
because the hearing's in five minutes

545
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,250
我们没有其它办法阻止加洛作证
and we don't have another way to stop Gallo from testifying.

546
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,780
你来这里干嘛  布莱顿
What the hell are you doing here, Bratton?

547
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,660
我来确定你在做自己的工作
I'm to make sure you're doing your job.

548
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,880
鬼扯  我又不为你工作
Bullshit, I don't work for you.

549
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,470
我没说过你为我工作  但如果你不能
I didn't say you did. But if you can't

550
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,410
解决此事  你也就不能
make this thing go away, you're not gonna be working

551
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,690
为改造公司工作了  马斯特森建筑公司也一样
for Reform Corp. Or Masterson Construction either.

552
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,800
-是吗  -当然
- Is that a fact? - Sure as hell is.

553
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,020
你不阻止我们的监狱友人作证
You don't stop our prison friend from testifying,

554
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,510
我就会接手此事
I'm gonna take this thing over

555
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,410
而我要做的第一件事是
and the first thing I'm going to do

556
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,580
交出一个替罪羊
is offer up a sacrificial lamb

557
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,130
名叫亚历克斯・威廉姆斯
named Alex Williams.

558
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,460
你现在觉得瑞秋的计划怎么样
How do you feel about Rachel's plan now?

559
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,170
各位  这是第二次
Gentlemen, this is the second time

560
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,460
在本案中提及弗兰克・加洛的问题
the issue of Frank Gallo's come up in this case.

561
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,110
-这次又是怎么回事  -法官
- What is it this time? - What it is, Your Honor,

562
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,820
这次是因为斯佩克特知道加洛会
is Mr. Specter knows Mr. Gallo is gonna

563
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,050
整得他跪地求饶
take him out at the knees

564
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,090
所以他会不顾一切阻止加洛这么做
and he's gonna do anything he can to stop him.

565
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,490
我不顾一切是因为弗兰克・加洛
I'll do anything I can because Frank Gallo

566
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,390
将要做伪证  而罗伯特・赞恩也心里有数
is about to commit perjury and Robert Zane knows it.

567
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,860
你在公开法庭指控他人有此罪状
You accuse someone of something like that

568
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,200
最好是他妈的拿点证据出来
in an open court, you better damn well have proof.

569
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,240
赞恩先生  注意言辞
Mr. Zane, watch yourself.

570
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,870
还有斯佩克特先生  他说得没错
And Mr. Specter, he's right.

571
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,150
我知道  法官
I know that, Your Honor.

572
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,230
所以我带了证据来
Which is why I have proof right here.

573
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,360
那是什么
And what is that?

574
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,970
弗兰克・加洛发送的瑞秋・赞恩的照片
Pictures of Rachel Zane sent by Frank Gallo

575
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,770
设计胁迫她父亲教唆其作伪证
designed to intimidate her father into suborning perjury.

576
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,530
你在撒谎
That is a lie!

577
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,240
不管信封里是什么东西  全是鬼扯
Whatever's in that envelope is bullshit.

578
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,060
赞恩先生  我不会追究你这番话
Mr. Zane, I'm going to let that language go

579
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,640
也不会指控你任何罪证
and I don't want to accuse you of anything,

580
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,150
但这些照片确实表明一个罪犯
but these photos do indicate that a known criminal

581
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,470
在威胁你的女儿
is threatening your daughter.

582
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,900
我才不在乎它们表明了什么
I don't give a shit what they indicate.

583
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,270
我从未见过这些照片
I've never seen them before in my life

584
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,120
我也不会教唆伪证
and I don't suborn perjury.

585
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,080
好了  我不知道是怎么回事
That's enough. I don't know what's going on here,

586
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,540
但直到我把事情搞清楚之前
but until I get to the bottom of this,

587
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,500
弗兰克・加洛不能作证
Frank Gallo is not testifying.

588
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,160
混蛋  你利用我女儿跟我作对
You son of a bitch. You used my daughter against me.

589
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,460
我一定会击败你
I'm gonna God damn knock you out.

590
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,840
罗伯特  不是你先对付我的吗
Robert, don't you come at me.

591
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,290
你不希望我对付你是因为你知道
You don't want me coming at you because you know

592
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,410
我一旦对你下手  你就完蛋了
once I got my hands on you you're done!

593
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,100
所以我要先打败你
Which is why I'll drop you before you do.

594
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,710
-尽管来打败我啊  -罗伯特
- Go ahead and drop me! - Robert.

595
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,900
你不会动手的  因为你知道这样不对
You're not gonna throw a punch because you know you're wrong.

596
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,140
罗伯特  罗伯特  住手
Robert, Robert! Hey, Robert, Robert! Stop!

597
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,530
这是瑞秋的主意
It was Rachel's idea.

598
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,190
-你刚才说什么  -哈维甚至不想这么做
- What did you just say? - Harvey didn't even wanna do it.

599
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,480
鬼扯  这是她的主意
Bullshit, it was her idea.

600
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,890
哈维  她是个成年人  作出了自己的决定
Robert, she's a grown woman, she made a decision.

601
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,470
你不相信我的话  可以亲自去问她
You don't believe me, you can ask her yourself.

602
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,050
但我告诉你  你只是想发火
But I'm telling you, you wanna be angry at someone,

603
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,270
-但别拿哈维当出气筒  -我不在乎
- do not take it out on Harvey. - I don't care

604
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,760
这是谁的主意
whose idea it was.

605
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,580
你利用她来诋毁我
You used her to slander me!

606
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,620
在公开法庭上
In open court!

607
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,760
你该为自己感到羞耻
You should be ashamed of yourself.

608
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,200
还有你  告诉你的改造公司同伙们
And you--you tell your Reform Corp Buddies

609
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,990
弗兰克・加洛无论如何一定会作证
that Frank Gallo is gonna take that stand one way or another.

610
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,040
他们做什么也阻止不了
And there's nothing they can do to stop it.

611
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,760
-马克  你好  -你好
- Mark, hi. - Hey, um,

612
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,460
希望我没有打扰你
I hope I'm not interrupting.

613
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,580
没有  其实我在...
No, actually, I'm just, um--

614
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,890
今晚的工作已经结束了
I'm just finishing up for the night.

615
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,550
你还在吗
Are you still there?

616
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,990
对
Yeah, um--

617
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,160
抱歉  我只是...
Sorry, um, I'm just--

618
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,900
-马克  -等等  拜托  唐娜
- Mark. - Hold on, please, Donna.

619
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,100
让我...就让我把话说出来
Let me just-- let me just get this out.

620
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,680
那天见到你让我找回很多感觉
Seeing you the other day brought up a lot of feelings.

621
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,200
我也是  但你结婚了
It did for me, too. But you're married.

622
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,200
-不太幸福  -马克
- Not happily. - Mark--

623
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,260
事实上  我曾经离开过你
The thing is, I walked away from you once before.

624
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,550
从那以后...
And ever since...

625
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,340
我一直在想如果我没有离开你  会怎么样
I--I wonder what would've happened if I hadn't--

626
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,740
我只是...我不能再一次离你而去
I just--I can't walk away from you again.

627
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,640
你想说什么
What are you saying?

628
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,430
我的工作室本周要举办一个会议
My office is hosting a conference this week

629
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,780
每个人都会留在城里  所以...
and everyone's staying in the city, so...

630
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,080
我在周六前都不会返回康涅狄格州
I'm not going back to Connecticut until Saturday.

631
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,650
我想在回去前见见你
I'd like to see you before I do.

632
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,940
我该说些什么
What am I supposed to say to that?

633
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,420
你什么都不必说
You don't have to say anything.

634
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,700
但我只是想让你知道
But I just wanted you to know

635
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,530
我未来两天都会住在嘉丽酒店
that I'll be staying at the Carlyle for the next two nights.

636
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,900
508房间
Room 508.

637
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,990
你妻子怎么办
What about your wife?

638
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,810
我不知道我该怎么处理
I don't know how I'm gonna handle that.

639
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,400
我也肯定没法明天就把这事解决掉
And I definitely won't be able to handle it by tomorrow.

640
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,120
所以如果你不想见我  我完全理解
So if you don't wanna see me, I'll understand.

641
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,710
但我得打这个电话
But I had to call.

642
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,590
晚安  唐娜
Good night, Donna.

643
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,860
晚安  马克
Good night, Mark.

644
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,780
格蕾琴  我说了我不接任何电话
Gretchen, I told you I'm not taking any calls.

645
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,650
路易吗
Louis?

646
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,870
希拉  你打了我的专用线
Sheila. You called my private line.

647
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,970
时机不对吗
Is this a bad time?

648
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,600
我不会说时机很好
I wouldn't say it's a great time.

649
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,750
路易  我说我没有告诉你我去哥伦比亚的事
Louis, I lied when I said I didn't tell you

650
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,170
是因为不想伤害你  那是谎话
about being at Columbia because I didn't wanna hurt you.

651
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,840
那你为什么不告诉我
Well, then why didn't you tell me?

652
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,250
因为我还没有忘记你
Because I haven't gotten you out of my system.

653
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,250
当我说这句话
And when I say that,

654
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,890
我真正的意思是  路易
what I'm really saying is, Louis,

655
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,510
在我结婚之前  我想最后要你一次
I want your body one last time before I walk down that aisle.

656
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,320
这是什么意思
Say what, now?

657
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,060
我想吞噬你每一寸肌肤
I wanna devour every inch of your flesh.

658
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,750
我要让你用六种方式震撼我的世界
I want you to rock my world six ways from Sunday.

659
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,630
-我要你...  -我想我理解了...
- I want to-- - I think I get the--

660
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,920
不许打断我
Do not interrupt me!

661
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,200
我要你在惊天动地的12到36小时内
Because I demand a travel to the moon and back

662
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,020
带我冲上月球再返回地面
seven to nine more times

663
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:47,010
我要七次  九次  更多次
in one life-shattering 12-36 hour period.

664
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,370
-天哪  -然后我要让你
- Oh, my God. - That's when I plan on

665
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,850
尖叫到声嘶力竭
making you scream until you can't scream anymore.

666
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,060
希拉  你突然是怎么了
Sheila, where is this coming from?

667
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,790
你知道是怎么了
You know exactly where it's coming from.

668
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,410
从你像维京战神一样踏入我的
It started the second you strutted into my office

669
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,630
办公室
like a Viking god,

670
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,780
准备劫掠一个无助的小女人开始
ready to pillage a helpless maiden.

671
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,320
我只是来电话问问申请的事
I was just coming in to check on the candidates.

672
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,180
我都不知道你...
I didn't even know that you were--

673
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,910
这就更性感了
That's what makes it so hot.

674
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,360
希拉  虽然你的描述
Shirley, even though this image

675
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,570
已经让我欲火焚身
is making my Viking mast unfurl to full sail,

676
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,440
但我觉得这样好像不太好
I don't think what you're suggesting is a good idea.

677
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,700
那是因为我还没告诉你
Well, that's because I haven't told you

678
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,880
我打算同意让你做你一直以来
that I'm finally gonna let you do that thing

679
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,140
渴望已久的事
that you always wanted to do.

680
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,200
-包括...  -是的
- Even the-- - Yes.

681
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,160
-还有...  -是的
- And with the-- - Yes.

682
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,780
那口音呢
And what about the accent?

683
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,240
随便加  路易
Oh, with all the accents, Louis.

684
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,410
随便加
With all the accents.

685
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,950
-口齿不清呢  -不行
- What about the lisp? - No.

686
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,810
希拉  我不能这样
Ahh! Sheila, I can't!

687
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,960
我尊重你的正直  路易
I respect your integrity, Louis.

688
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,840
但这不足以阻止我
But not enough to stop me from waiting

689
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,240
今晚在我们的老房间等你
for you tomorrow night in our old hotel suite.

690
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,140
战斗室吗
The War Room?

691
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,270
一点没错
The very one.

692
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,220
路易  你得来一下大办公室
Louis, you've gotta come down to the bullpen for a second.

693
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,070
你绝不会相信布莱恩给朗斯顿和解
You're not gonna believe what Brian cooked up

694
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,170
想出了什么好办法
for the Langston settlement.

695
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,350
-现在不行  瑞去  -为什么
- I can't right now, Rachel. - Why not?

696
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,310
只要一下下
It's only going to take a second.

697
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,670
因为我现在不打算离开桌子  瑞秋
Because I'm not getting up right now, Rachel,

698
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,220
说什么都不行
and there's nothing you can say to change that.

699
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,080
路易  你怎么了
Louis, what's going on?

700
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,780
刚和希拉通完电话
Just got off the phone with Sheila.

701
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,090
她要结婚了  她想和我在她结婚前
She's getting married and she wants to have one last fling

702
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,950
最后放纵一次
before she goes down the aisle.

703
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,110
你不想这么做
And you don't wanna do that because

704
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,190
因为你不想成为这种人
you don't wanna be that kind of person.

705
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,640
-是的  -那还有什么问题
- No, I don't. - So then what's the problem?

706
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,370
问题是...
The problem is--is...

707
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,060
我的生活好久以来都很不顺
I haven't had anything go my way in so long,

708
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,950
我都不知道顺心是什么感觉了
I can't even remember what that's like.

709
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,190
我真的很想有一晚上
And I could really use a night where

710
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,950
让我忘掉所有痛苦  忘掉自己
I can forget my pain and feel good about myself.

711
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,290
路易  我不知道改怎么建议
Louis, I can't tell you what the answer is

712
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,500
因为做这种事
because it's not a small thing

713
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,210
不是件小事
to do something like that.

714
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,050
但我想说  我觉得你很善良
But if it helps, I know you have a good heart.

715
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,300
所以不管你怎么决定  都不会改变
So whatever you decide, it's not gonna change

716
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,040
我对你的看法
how I feel about you.

717
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,060
谢谢  瑞秋
Thanks, Rachel.

718
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,410
你来干什么  律师
What are you doing here, Counselor?

719
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,040
我来是因为我有关于改造公司的
I'm here because I have relevant information

720
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,180
-信息告诉你  -如果是这样
- on the Reform Corp. Matter. - And if that's the case,

721
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,060
那你应该和罗伯特・赞恩
you should be doing it in chambers

722
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,280
-一起在法官办公室  -法官大人
- and Robert Zane should be there. - Your Honor,

723
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,240
罗伯特・赞恩疯了
Robert Zane's not in his right mind.

724
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,740
你看到他昨天的反应了
You saw what happened to him yesterday

725
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,770
所以在你对弗兰克・加洛的事宣判前
and that's why before you rule on Frank Gallo--

726
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,110
-别说了  斯佩克特先生  -不行
- Stop right there, Mr. Specter. - No, I'm not gonna stop there.

727
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,120
-别说了  -法官大人....
- Yes, you are. - Your Honor--

728
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,050
弗兰克・加洛死了
Frank Gallo is dead.

729
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,430
-什么  -他昨晚在囚室被谋杀了
- What? - He was murdered in his cell last night.

730
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,400
所以不管你要说什么更他有关的
So whatever it was that you were going

731
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,820
都与本案无关了
to say about him is irrelevant.

732
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,170
那人不能出庭了
The man can't testify.

733
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,820
所以我想可以让他安息了
So I think it's time to let him rest in peace.

734
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,870
唐娜
Donna.

735
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,210
你站这里多久了
How long have you been standing there?

736
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,660
我刚路过  没认出来你
I was just walking by and I didn't recognize you.

737
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,310
所以你在想  那个站在哈维办公室的
And you thought, who is that strange woman

738
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,750
陌生女人是谁
in Harvey's office?

739
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,070
我不是这么想的
That's not what I thought.

740
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,200
你见到哈维了吗
Have you seen Harvey, by any chance?

741
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,180
他今天都不在
He's actually out for the rest of the day.

742
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,690
没事  晚上见他好了
That's okay. I'll just see him tonight.

743
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,130
我知道了
Oh, I get it.

744
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,440
你不告而来
You stopped by to surprise him

745
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,510
是因为这是你们两个月纪念日
because it's your two month anniversary.

746
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,500
-你怎么知道的  -我很关心他
- How can you know that? - Because I care about him.

747
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,300
你进入他的生活
And you coming into his life...

748
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,440
是个值得纪念的日子
is a memorable event.

749
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,680
很高兴见到你  唐娜
Well, it was good to see you, Donna.

750
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,760
卡尔博纳
Carbone.

751
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,970
什么
I'm sorry.

752
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,100
那地方很简陋
It's a hole in the wall,

753
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,920
但却是哈维最喜欢的餐馆之一
but it's one of Harvey's favorite places.

754
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,890
如果你要订餐
So if you're looking for a reservation--

755
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,800
其实  我已经订过了
Actually, I already have one.

756
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,870
我猜猜
Oh, let me guess.

757
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,630
-就在卡尔博纳  -是的
- At Carbone. - Yes.

758
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,810
你们肯定会有个愉快的夜晚
Well, I'm sure you'll have a great time.

759
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,900
谢谢你的建议  唐娜
Thank you for the recommendation, Donna.

760
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,960
你在这儿  我到处找你
There you are. I've been looking all over for you.

761
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,780
-怎么了  瑞秋  -我在想
- What is it, Rachel? - Okay, I was thinking,

762
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,910
我们不是说好要一起喝酒但一直没去
we never got to have those drinks we talked about

763
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,330
唐娜  我知道你最近
and, Donna, I know you've been going through

764
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,860
事情很多
a lot of stuff, lately.

765
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,090
所以我在想也许你可以
So I thought maybe you could use a night

766
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,030
把烦恼都抛诸脑后一夜
where you just lose your troubles

767
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,090
让自己放纵一下
and just feel good about yourself.

768
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,610
-确实  -怎么样
- I could. - So, what do you say?

769
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,060
那今晚哈利艾特・斯佩克特
Is Harriett Specter available

770
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,420
能和米歇尔・罗斯出去喝一杯吗
to go out with Michelle Ross tonight?

771
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,190
今晚不行  瑞秋  我有约了
I can't tonight, Rachel; I have plans.

772
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,830
好神秘  是约了个帅哥吗
What's mysterious. What do you have, a hot date?

773
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,830
算是吧
Yeah. Something like that.

774
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
-他在吗  -在  但你不能进去
- Is he in? - Yes, but you can't go in there.

775
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,340
你拦我试试
Try and stop me.

776
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,530
-等等  -你个混蛋
- Wait a second. - You son of a bitch.

777
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,350
你杀了弗兰克・加洛
You murdered Frank Gallo.

778
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,810
阿什莉  我来处理吧
Ashley, I'll handle this.

779
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,940
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

780
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,150
放屁  你说过如果我不能阻止他作证
Bullshit! You said if I couldn't stop him from testifying,

781
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,290
你就会找其他人来阻止他
you'd find someone who could.

782
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,770
我是说会找托马斯・布莱顿
I meant I'd get Thomas Bratton involved.

783
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,270
不是说杀人灭口
I didn't mean I'd kill a man.

784
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,270
而你也确实阻止加洛出庭作证了
And you did stop Gallo from testifying,

785
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,520
又有什么关系呢
so why would it matter?

786
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,380
因为他想确认罗伯特・赞恩
Because he wanted to make sure that Robert Zane

787
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,180
没有改变法庭决定  你就杀了他
didn't reverse it, so you had him murdered.

788
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,640
那你说说我是怎么策划的这起故意谋杀
And how exactly did I arrange this supposed murder?

789
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,190
就跟你杀了那个警卫然后掩盖罪行一样
The same damn way you killed that guard and covered it up.

790
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:19,290
我再说一遍  哈维  听不懂你说什么
Once again, Harvey, I have no idea what you're talking about.

791
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,320
随便你想怎么指责我
And you can accuse me of anything you want,

792
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,920
那个人可是冷酷无情的罪犯
but that man was a hardened criminal

793
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,700
很多人有很多理由想要他死
who could've been killed by anyone for anything.

794
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,390
我才不会因为这个费半点心思
And I am not gonna lose a second of sleep over it.

795
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,850
恕我不赞同
I beg to differ.

796
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,320
-罗伯特  -什么情况
- Robert. - What the hell is going on here?

797
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,780
我告诉你什么情况
I'll tell you what's going on.

798
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,010
有点东西要给你看
I got something for you to see.

799
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,290
可不是什么网飞剧上演的
And it's not on Netflix.

800
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,900
弗兰克・加洛  09842号囚犯
Frank Gallo, prisoner 09842.

801
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,670
丹伯里联邦监狱
Danbury Federal Prison.

802
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,630
好了  废话不多说
All right. Enough bullshit.

803
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,010
我是你的律师  这些都将不被采信
I'm your lawyer. None of this is admissible.

804
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,870
现在  告诉我真相
Now tell me the truth,

805
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,610
好让我了解什么情况
so I know what I'm dealing with.

806
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,540
你想要真相  那我就告诉你真相
All right, you want the truth, let's just get to it.

807
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,780
一个警卫给了某个外面的律师一张纸条
There was a guard, sent a letter to some lawyer on the outside

808
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,510
那个律师对监狱的事情起了疑心
who was getting suspicious of what was going on in there.

809
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,390
他们想让我警告他
They wanted me to remind him

810
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,900
他到底几斤几两
of where he was in the food chain.

811
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,510
-你乐意去做吗  -不  我不想
- And you were happy to do it. - No, I wasn't.

812
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,970
在这里我们可能是硬汉
We were hard men in there.

813
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
是暴徒  是杀人犯
Tough guys, murderers.

814
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,120
那警卫只是个善良的老头
That guard was just a sweet, old man.

815
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,740
一辈子都未曾与人不善
Never hurt a soul in all his years.

816
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,980
你觉得我会信吗
And you expect me to believe all that.

817
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,460
信不信由你  我只是说出真相
You can believe it or not, it's the truth.

818
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,200
我跟他们说我不做
So I told them I wouldn't do it

819
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,340
直到他们的老大
until whoever was running the show

820
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,690
直接找到了我
came to me directly.

821
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,820
是他们叫来的
And they made that happen.

822
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,950
他们没办法
They had no choice.

823
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,460
第二天  那人就出现在我牢房前
Next day, the guy showed up right in my God damn cell

824
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,050
就跟这座监狱是他建的似的
like he owned the place,

825
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,410
而事实也确实如此  -那人是谁
which he did. - And who exactly was that?

826
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,920
罗杰・夏皮罗  改造公司的首席执行官
Roger Shapiro. CEO of Reform Corp.

827
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,680
然后发生了什么
And then what happened?

828
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,950
我
I, uh--

829
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,250
那天晚上我在食堂截住他
I got him alone that night in the mess hall.

830
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,870
你都想不到  那老头还挺能打
Wouldn't you know, the old man still had some fight in him.

831
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,130
然后我意识到  不是他死就是我死
Next thing I knew, it was him or me, so--

832
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,100
所以我把他放倒了
I had to put him down.

833
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,350
你杀了他
You killed him.

834
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,330
是的
Yeah.

835
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,970
我杀了他
I killed him.

836
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,240
之后你怎么做的
And then what did you do?

837
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,020
我告诉他们这次之后  我就洗手不干了
I told them I was done, out, no more.

838
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,990
第二天晚上  罗杰・夏皮罗
Next night, Roger Shapiro sent five of my friends

839
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,610
让我的五个朋友也对我做了同样的事
to do the same thing to me.

840
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,210
看来你麻烦不小啊  罗杰
Looks like you're in some deep shit, Roger.

841
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,250
我不信
I don't believe it.

842
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,310
所以你俩是合起伙来整我是吗
So you two were in on this together.

843
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,350
用你的话说  我不知道你在说什么
To quote you, I have no idea what you're talking about.

844
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,390
我今天早上绝对没有去罗伯特家里
I certainly didn't go to Robert's house this morning

845
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,070
告诉他我觉得你杀了弗兰克・加洛
and tell him that I think that you had Frank Gallo murdered

846
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,730
因此他不能出庭作证了
so he wouldn't be able to testify.

847
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,470
我也绝对没有说如果你真的杀了他
And I certainly didn't say if you had,

848
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:41,170
那你就犯了个大错  因为现在这段录像
you made a huge mistake because now this tape

849
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,340
就成了临终忏悔
is a death bed confession

850
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,570
法律上是可采信的
and by law is admissible.

851
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,280
我之前说的那些
And all that bullshit I came up with,

852
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,750
关于罗伯特被弗兰克・加洛恐吓
about Robert being intimidated by Frank Gallo,

853
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,590
就根本不成立了
well, that doesn't apply anymore

854
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,450
因为弗兰克・加洛已经死了
because Frank Gallo's dead.

855
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,970
-你们到底想怎样  -我想要的
- So what do you want? - What I want

856
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,470
就是你因谋杀罪入狱
is for you to go away for murder.

857
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,910
但那是不可能的
But that's not gonna happen,

858
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,230
所以我会给你一个我满意的数字
so I'll settle for the number I wanted in the first place.

859
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,990
而你从此以后再不能对犯人做这种烂事
But you're never gonna pull this shit again on prisoners

860
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,270
如果你这么做了
because if you do,

861
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,970
我才不管什么亚历克斯・威廉姆斯
I don't care about Alex Williams.

862
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,270
这段录像就会交到司法部
This tape goes to the Department of Justice

863
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,680
而你  就会被关进你自己建的监狱
and you are headed to one of your own prisons,

864
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,300
不出五秒
five seconds later.

865
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,070
我想这个选择我能接受
I think that's something that I could work with.

866
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,690
如果没有其他事  还请你们出去
Now, if there's nothing else, I'd like you both to leave.

867
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,280
咱们还没完
Oh, we're not done with you yet.

868
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,190
-还有什么  -我来告诉你
- What now? - I'll tell you what now,

869
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,760
你要写一些东西给我
you're gonna write up something for me

870
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,420
而你不会喜欢的
and you're not gonna like it.

871
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,970
但如果你不想蹲大牢
But if you wanna stay out of prison,

872
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,840
你就得保证  你所写的都按我的要求来
you're gonna make damn sure it says exactly what I need it to.

873
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,100
什么情况
What the hell is this?

874
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,150
汤米
Tommy.

875
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,230
你能告诉我你怎么进来的吗
You mind telling me how the hell you got in here?

876
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,890
这里的人们都喜欢我  汤米
People like me here, Tommy.

877
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,500
所以我进来了
That's how I got in.

878
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,140
你应该问我为什么来这
But the question you should be asking is why I'm here.

879
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,710
我才不管你过来干嘛
I don't give a shit why you're here.

880
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,380
我要拿回我的宣誓书
I want my God damn affidavit back.

881
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,410
当然了  你还想让我签
Sure thing. You also want me to sign over

882
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,840
我自己住的汉普顿斯别墅的契约呢
the deed to my house in the Hamptons, while I'm at it?

883
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,510
那破房子你自己留着住吧
You can keep your shitty house.

884
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,950
毕竟你辞职后还得有个遮风挡雨的地儿
Because you're gonna need someplace to go after you resign.

885
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,400
你说什么
What did you just say to me?

886
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,210
他说他过来要他的宣誓书
He said he's here for his affidavit

887
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,110
还有你的辞呈  你个自以为是的老混球
and your resignation, you smug piece of shit.

888
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,400
你们这是  准备让我滚蛋吗
What you guys, plan on beating it out of me?

889
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,290
你们才是该滚蛋的人
Because that's the only way you'd get it.

890
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,400
我们不会为难老年人  汤米
We don't need to beat up an old man, Tommy.

891
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,600
只想让你看看这个
We just need to show you this.

892
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,010
那是什么
What's that?

893
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,490
这是罗杰・夏皮罗的签字认罪书
That's a signed confession from Roger Shapiro,

894
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,810
上面写着他参与了阴谋
say he entered into a conspiracy

895
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,250
与马斯特森建筑公司合谋
with Masterson Construction to defraud

896
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,720
欺骗了联邦政府
the United States government.

897
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,090
而这阴谋就是你一手策划的
And that that conspiracy was arranged by you.

898
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,360
不可能  罗杰不可能这么做
No way. Roger would never do that.

899
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,540
但他做了  出于和他同样的原因
Oh, he did it. For the same reason

900
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,270
你也会按我们说的做
you're gonna give us what we want.

901
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,020
因为我们抓住了他的要害
We had him by the balls.

902
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,170
就像我现在抓住了你的要害一样  汤米
Just like I got you right now, Tommy.

903
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,720
你可以给他打个电话问问
So you can pick up the phone and call him,

904
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,040
或者看看我的表情像不像在说谎
or you can look at my face and see I'm not lying.

905
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,010
不管怎样  没拿到我们想要的结果
But either way, we're not leaving here

906
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,890
我们都不会离开
without getting what we want.

907
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,570
你们也不能
I'm not going to stand here

908
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,850
站这儿等我写辞职信吧
and write my resignation letter in front of you two, okay?

909
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,360
好在我们帮你写好了
Then it's a good thing we wrote one up for you.

910
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,560
对了  记得我说你说你欠我人情对吧
By the way, remember when I told you you owed me?

911
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,270
我想现在我们扯平了
I'd pretty much say we're even.

912
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,890
我觉得这相当不相当
I don't think this word even means what you think it means.

913
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,300
是吗
Oh, well, is that a fact?

914
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,790
当然了  我只是拒绝你一个工作
You're damn right it is. I turned down a job offer.

915
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,140
你可是被我救出了监狱
You were gonna go to prison.

916
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,790
你这辈子都欠我的
You owe me for the rest of your life.

917
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,570
收到  你和我  扯平了
Got it. Me and you, square.

918
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,540
我再说一次  你对扯平的理解
Once again, I don't think the word square

919
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,500
-也偏差很大  -没错
- means what you think it means. - You're right.

920
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,150
再讹你一顿饭才够
We still gotta go eat on you.

921
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,880
抱歉  今晚不行  亚历克斯  我有约
Sorry, can't tonight, Alex. I got other plans.

922
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,270
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

923
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,430
我来道歉
I came to apologize for what I did.

924
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,540
你不是说是瑞秋的主意吗
I thought you said it was Rachel's idea.

925
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,880
没错  但你也说我该阻止她
It was, but you said i should've stopped it in its tracks

926
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,100
你是对的
and you were right.

927
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,590
罗伯特  我很抱歉
Robert, I'm sorry.

928
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,210
我爱瑞秋  我绝不会伤害她
I love Rachel. I would never do anything to hurt her.

929
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,450
但我也不该伤害你
But I should've known to never do anything to hurt you.

930
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,920
能说出这种话也很需要勇气  迈克
It takes a big man to say that, Mike.

931
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,790
谢谢
I appreciate it.

932
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,880
而且我也不得不承认  最后的结果
And I'd be lying if I didn't admit it worked out

933
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,410
对大家都好
for everybody in the end.

934
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,040
也不是所有人
Yeah, not everybody.

935
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,050
对那个混蛋的遭遇我可毫不愧疚
I'm not losing any sleep over that son of a bitch.

936
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,520
他也许没拿瑞秋威胁我
He may not have threatened Rachel to me,

937
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,230
但绝对是拿瑞秋威胁你了
but he sure as hell threatened her to you.

938
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,540
我知道  我也知道他是杀人犯
I know. And I know he was a murderer.

939
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,550
但哈维给我看了录像
But Harvey showed me that tape.

940
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,880
你能看出他有多爱女儿
You can see how much he cared about his daughter.

941
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,030
而事实是
Fact of the matter is,

942
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,800
他们再也无法相见了
they're never gonna see each other again.

943
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,080
敬弗兰克・加洛
Then to Frank Gallo.

944
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,000
愿他安息
May he rest in peace.

945
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,850
我跟他们说我不干了  我退出
I told them I was done. No more, out.

946
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,150
第二天晚上  罗杰・夏皮罗派来五个
Next night, Roger Shapiro sent five of my friends

947
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,820
我的伙计  对我做了一样的事
to do the same thing to me.

948
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,800
你愿意出庭作证吗
You're willing to testify to that in court.

949
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,560
绝不  我作证  他们会给我谋杀罪
No way, I tell them that, they'll put me away for murder.

950
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,310
-你已经在监狱了  -但刑期只有七年
- You're already away. - Yeah, for seven more years.

951
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,700
把这事告诉他们  我就是无期了
I tell them this, they'll put me away for life.

952
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,150
我要是能为你争取到豁免权呢
What if I can get you immunity?

953
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,200
-你无法保证  -没错
- You can't promise me that. - No, I can't.

954
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,910
但如果你为我这么做  我绝不会
But if you did this for me, there's no way

955
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,820
让他们判你谋杀罪
I'm gonna let them convict you for murder.

956
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,830
我凭什么相信你
Why should I believe you?

957
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,210
和你应该出庭作证的理由一样
For the same reason you need to take that stand.

958
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,900
我理解男人对女儿的爱
I know what it's like to have a daughter.

959
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,180
我也知道你和迈克・罗斯签协议
And I know you cut that deal with Mike Ross

960
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,970
就是为了让她原谅你
so that she'd forgive you.

961
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,430
但仅仅如此还不足以让她原谅你
But she needs more than that to forgive you.

962
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,510
她需要知道她父亲是个好人
She needs to know her father is a good man.

963
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,740
-我不是好人  -也许如此
- I'm not a good man. - Yeah, maybe not.

964
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,820
但如果你出庭  告诉世界你的所作所为
But if you got up there and told the world what you did,

965
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,580
阻止了那群禽兽再继续犯罪...
and stopped these monsters from ever doing it again--

966
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,540
让她看到这样的你  她一定会原谅你
you let her see that-- she'll forgive you.

967
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,810
我以自己的女儿起誓
And I swear on my own daughter,

968
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,290
我不会让你失望
I will not let you go down for it.

969
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,570
好
Okay.

970
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,280
我答应
I'll do it.

971
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,640
丹妮斯・加洛吗
Denise Gallo?

972
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,260
你是谁
Who are you?

973
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,000
认识你父亲的一个人
Someone who knew your father.

974
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:21,380
他  要我把这个给你
He, uh, wanted you to have this.

975
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,870
我想告诉你
I want you to know,

976
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,040
他是个好人
he was a decent man.

977
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,040
我想我终于理解
I believe I just figured out

978
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,040
你为什么这么喜欢这里了
why you fancy this place so much.

979
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,970
-为什么  -色调  烛光
- Why's that? - Colors and the candle light.

980
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,920
它们的衬托让你更帅了
They make you look tremendously handsome.

981
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,730
阿加德医生  要不是我了解你
Dr. Agard, if I didn't know better,

982
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,220
会以为你在搭讪我了
I'd think you were hitting on me.

983
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,220
要不是你了解我
If you didn't know better,

984
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,900
我也不会有机会在这里
I never would've gotten the chance.

985
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,240
-那是什么  -一个看到它让我想起了你的
- What's that? - It's just a little something

986
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,170
小东西
I saw that made me think of you.

987
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,930
-而且  -而且什么
- And-- - And what?

988
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,500
今天是我们恋爱两个月纪念日
It's our two month anniversary.

989
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,010
我不想搞的太隆重
I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

990
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,130
而且我也没有说
And I certainly don't expect you to

991
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,880
-你必须记得  只是...  -宝拉  我当然记得
- to have remembered, but-- - Paula, of course I remembered.

992
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,690
不然你以为我为什么带了这个
Why do you think I got you this?

993
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,530
这是你公寓的钥匙
That's the key to your apartment.

994
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,880
没错
Yes, it is.

995
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,540
你真贴心
This is incredibly sweet.

996
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,360
但这也骗不到我
But it isn't gonna fool me into believing

997
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,780
你根本不知道
that you had the faintest notion

998
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,860
今天是我们两个月纪念日吧
it was our two month anniversary.

999
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,950
没错  我确实不知道  但是...
You're right. I didn't. But...

1000
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,830
我本来就打算今晚给你的
I was gonna give you these tonight, anyway.

1001
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,010
其实仔细想想
Which, if you think about it,

1002
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,920
这不是更特别了吗
makes it even more special.

1003
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,010
纪念日快乐  宝拉
Happy anniversary, Paula.

1004
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,890
纪念日快乐  哈维
Happy anniversary, Harvey.

1005
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,430
{\an8}瑞秋・赞恩
希望你一个人也玩得愉快

1006
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,430
{\an8}你值得拥有最好的

1007
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,200
我不是很确定你会来
I--I didn't know if you'd come.

1008
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,700
对不起  马克
I'm sorry, Mark.

1009
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,650
我做不到
I can't do this.

1010
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,450
我不是很确定你会来
I didn't know if you'd come.

1011
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,910
我怎么会不来
How could I not?
