把你的简历留下就好  梅丽莎
Why don't you just leave your resume, Marissa?

158
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,300
我没简历
I don't have one.

159
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,660
反正我真人比简历好多了
I'm much better in person, anyway.

160
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,550
就雇我一天
Look, just hire me for one day,

161
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,890
等你找到更好的人选就可以换掉我
just until you get someone better.

162
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,770
我向你保证  你找不到更好的
And I promise you won't get someone better.

163
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,500
{\an8}仓库与商场销售人员工会
本地组织

164
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,790
把法律援助咨询时间
You limit your pro bono consultations

165
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,490
限制在每人20分钟以内
to 20 minutes each.

166
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,590
如果要解决他们的法律问题需要更多时间
If their legal issues require more time,

167
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,390
去找卢卡
go to Lucca.

168
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,550
由她来批准是否需要更多时间
She will sign off on more time.

169
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,050
记住  你们来这里
Remember, you're only here

170
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,740
是提供法律咨询的  而不是来工作
to offer legal advice, not legal work.

171
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,100
别被缠住了  如果可以
Don't get tied down. Move people on

172
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,860
把他们推荐到其他法律渠道去
into other legal resources when you can.

173
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,130
公诉辩护或者法律援助都行
Prairie State or Legal Assistance.

174
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,870
你们就是电梯里的关门按钮
You're the "door close" button in the elevator.

175
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,090
令人安慰  但不一定有多大作用
Comforting, but not necessarily effective.

176
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,270
我们开始吧
Here we go.

177
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,070
会友们  听我说  听我说
Okay, members, listen up, listen up.

178
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,240
{\an8}仓库与商场销售人员工会
了解你的权力  在今天获取免费法律咨询

179
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,230
记住这些律师是以工会支持者的身份过来
Remember these lawyers are here as union advocates,

180
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,510
所以请把问题限制在工作事宜上
so please limit your questions to workplace matters.

181
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,990
只限于工作事宜
Only workplace matters.

182
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,630
趁着工作日午休时间来的请举手
Okay, who is here on their work break, please raise your hand.

183
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,620
得了吧
Oh, come on.

184
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,710
多尼  我知道今天是你的休息日
Donny, I know it's your day off.

185
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,850
把手放下
Get your hand down.

186
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,300
咨询只限在午休的人
Only people on their lunch break.

187
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,680
别乱举手  你们这样只会损害
Come on, you're only screwing over

188
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,540
你工会的兄弟姐妹的权益
your union brother and sister.

189
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,970
好的  那些在午休的人上台来
Good. Those on lunch break, come on up to the stage.

190
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,430
在每桌前排队  开始吧
Line up for each desk. Let's go.

191
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,150
你真要我去找别人吗
You're seriously telling me I have to go to someone else

192
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,250
我午休时间就这么点
on my lunch break?

193
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,950
事情是这样的  女士  我们不是过来
The thing is, ma'am, we're not really here

194
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,030
解决家庭法问题的  但我能介绍你去
to help with family law issues, but, uh, I can refer you to...

195
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,790
他不交抚养费
He's not paying child support!

196
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,990
我要怎么维持生计呢
How am I supposed to make ends meet

197
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,390
他不交抚养费
if he won't pay child support?

198
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,550
我懂  我很抱歉  只是
I know, I'm sorry. It's just...

199
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,230
我不应该提供这方面的帮助
Well, I'm not really supposed to help with...

200
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,630
那你过来干什么
Then why are you here?

201
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,450
如果你不能帮忙  你过来干什么
If you can't help, why are you here?

202
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,850
我需要帮助
I need help.

203
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,050
你好
Hello.

204
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,600
拜托
Oh, come on.

205
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,770
我来帮忙
I'm gonna help you out here.

206
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,850
谢谢
Thank you.

207
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,350
先生  你要去我的桌子吗
Sir, would you like to come to my desk?

208
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,960
不用  我这队挺好
No, I'm good here.

209
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,430
我有三年从业经验
I'm a third-year associate.

210
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,780
她才拿到资格证
She just passed the bar.

211
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,000
没关系
That's okay.

212
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,150
我就排这里
I'm sticking.

213
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,850
下一位
Next?

214
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,440
一周只有400美元  我过不下去
I, I just can't survive on $400 a week.

215
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,610
我付不起房租
I can't pay for my rent.

216
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,260
付不起前妻的抚养费
I can't pay for my ex-wife.

217
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,320
他们没照税后收入来调整发薪
And they're not adjusting it for after taxes.

218
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,980
而是按总收入直接扣了
They're just taking it right off the top.

219
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,630
我很抱歉  我不太明白
I-I'm sorry, I don't understand.

220
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,860
你一周工资是400美元吗
You're...you're being paid $400 a week?

221
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,060
对  等等  不是
Yeah. Wait, no.

222
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,940
我房租是这两倍  好吗
And my rent is twice that. Okay?

223
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,560
你要接电话吗
Do you need to get that?

224
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,290
不用
No.

225
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,780
{\an8}吃屎去吧  臭婊子

226
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,550
不用  总有各种消息
Uh, no. It does that.

227
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,040
我手机也是
Yeah, mine, too.

228
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,150
我曾经还会收到些好消息
You know, I used to get some good news,

229
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,780
但现在  我觉得都是些坏消息
but now I feel like it's all bad.

230
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,020
我都不想回复它们
I don't even like answering it nowadays.

231
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,880
我很抱歉  我不太明白
So, um, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm not too sure

232
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,800
他们是怎么调低你薪水的
how they were able to lower your salary.

233
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,880
不是调低
Not lower.

234
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,800
是抵扣
Garnish.

235
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,260
他们说我偷了400双跑步鞋
They're saying that I stole 400 running shoes.

236
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,990
-什么  400双跑步鞋  -没错
- What? 400 running shoes? - Yeah.

237
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,740
他们说值七万  但那是按零售价算的
And they say that's $70,000, but that's retail,

238
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,720
他们又不是按零售价买的
and they don't pay retail.

239
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,000
而是按批发价  所以赔偿应该只有一半
They just pay wholesale, so it should be half that.

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,960
等等  抱歉  你能再说一次吗
Wait, I'm sorry. Could-could you start again?

241
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,320
好吧  BMI
Okay, BMI...

242
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,430
我在的店说我偷了400双运动鞋
...my store says that I stole 400 running shoes.

243
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,550
你偷了吗
And did you?

244
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,580
没有  我这辈子都没偷过东西
No, I've never stolen anything in my entire life.

245
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,180
但他们是按零售价来抵扣我薪水的
But they're garnishing my wages for the retail amount,

246
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,340
实际该按照批发价来扣
and it should be the wholesale amount.

247
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,310
那让我多赔了一倍的钱
That's double what I should pay!

248
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,370
但如果你没偷东西的话
But if you didn't steal anything,

249
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,910
为什么要让他们抵扣你的薪水
why are you letting them garnish your wages at all?

250
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,360
因为我签了供认书
Because I signed a confession.

251
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,010
我不明白  他为什么要供认
I don't understand. Why did he confess?

252
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,250
他们逼他这么做的
They pressured him to.

253
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,820
如果不签就要开除他
They threatened to fire him if he didn't.

254
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,190
他只是想让他们
He just wants them to charge him

255
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,680
以批发价算赔偿  而不是零售价
the wholesale amount and not the retail amount.

256
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,530
他还想为这事去仲裁吗
And he wants to go to arbitration for that?

257
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,420
他的合同要求他去仲裁
Well, his contract requires that he go to arbitration.

258
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,180
但他想让我来代理他
But he wants me to represent him.

259
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,320
我需要你的批准
I just need you to sign me off

260
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,160
再多两小时
on two more hours work.

261
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,200
你知道这只是无偿法援吧
You know this is just pro bono?

262
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,840
对吧  这只是个善意姿态而已
Right? It's a goodwill gesture.

263
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,890
我们不是来纠正不公的
We're not here to right a wrong.

264
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,110
我知道
No, I know,

265
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,290
但就两小时工作量而已
but it's only two hours work.

266
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,570
我想这样做
I want to do it.

267
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,240
仲裁是什么时候
When's the arbitration?

268
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,560
今天下午
This afternoon.

269
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,480
好
Okay.

270
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,800
祝你好运
Good luck.

271
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,310
你没事吧
Everything good with you?

272
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,230
还好
Yeah.

273
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,140
这些日子以来第一次感觉还行
Yeah, for the first time in a while... yes.

274
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,360
注意力都在别人的麻烦上对你是有好处的
It's good when you can focus on someone else's problem.

275
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,640
这是第一个我没被认出来的地方
First place I've been I wasn't recognized.

276
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,190
这是我们当务之急的案子
This is our highest priority case.

277
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,530
牢房里的绞刑  霍利·奥林
It's a hanging in a jail cell... Holly Orlin.

278
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,470
最上面你能看到「芝加哥论坛报」的一篇文章
You'll find a Chicago Tribune article on top there.

279
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,290
这是我这几年来看过的库克县监狱虐待案里
This is the worst Cook County jail abuse

280
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,900
最惨的一例
I have seen in years.

281
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,780
我们要求赔偿1200万
So, we're suing for $12 million,

282
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,830
但同时我们也希望能够在庭审前和解
but we do expect settlement before trial.

283
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,590
-有监控录像吗  -没有
- Any videotape? - No.

284
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,360
但是我们一个有非常值得同情的家庭
But we have a very sympathetic family

285
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,320
以及一位悲痛欲绝的寡妇
and a grieving widower.

286
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,760
我们需要的就是你们30万的赞助
So, all we need of your financing is $300 thousand.

287
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,590
不  不过谢了
No. Thanks, though.

288
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,110
我们的算法不看好起诉警方
Our algorithm is going cool on police suits.

289
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,180
你确定吗
You sure about that?

290
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,110
当然  还有别的吗
Mm-hmm. What else?

291
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,000
我想  戴安
Well, I think that, uh, Diane,

292
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,470
我们的新合伙人  她刚刚入伙
our newest partner... she just joined us

293
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,250
从洛哈特&德克尔&古斯曼过来的
from Lockhart, Deckler & Gussman...

294
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,500
由她来说说新案子
can speak to a new case.

295
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,380
我们一直在跟滥用假释权的案子
Uh, we've been looking into parole abuses.

296
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,530
一些假释申请因为惩罚性原因而被拒绝
Some parolees have been rejected for, uh, punitive reasons.

297
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,760
我认为我的合伙人担心这个方向没钱可赚
I think my partner worries there's no money there.

298
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,110
那取决于州政府觉得在这点上是否容易被攻击
That depends on how vulnerable the State feels.

299
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,130
不  取决于趋势
No. It depends on the trend.

300
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,920
趋势不利于你们的提议
The trend is against you.

301
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,390
我们明白你有自己的算法小魔咒
Look, now we understand you have your little algebraic spells,

302
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,060
但是我们了解整个体系
but we understand the system.

303
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,210
而你又能得到我们一成的收入
And you'll get ten percent of our earnings.

304
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,650
为什么不让我们给你赚些钱呢
Why don't you let us help you make some money?

305
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,480
你们还有什么
What else have you got?

306
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,080
玩忽职守
Malpractice?

307
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,780
这是一个玩忽职守诉讼案
It's a malpractice suit.

308
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,770
-失陪一下  -去吧
- Uh, excuse me. - Yeah.

309
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,230
-第二页  -什么事
- Second page. - What's wrong?

310
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,140
有人来找你
Someone here to see you.

311
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,540
丽诺·林德尔
Lenore Rindell.

312
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,100
在哪
Where?

313
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,780
你办公室
In your office.

314
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,250
要我打发她走吗
You want me to get rid of her?

315
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,980
你想要什么  丽诺
What do you need, Lenore?

316
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,630
我  我来找玛娅
I-I came to see Maia.

317
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,310
她外出了
She's out.

318
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,270
她不跟我说话  也不接我的电话
She's not talking to me, she's not answering my calls.

319
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,410
估计是她的律师不让的
My guess is her lawyer told her not to.

320
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,450
你能跟她谈谈吗  戴安  求你了
Can you talk to her, Diane? Please.

321
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,380
不行
No.

322
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,790
为什么
Why?

323
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,540
我不知道你活在什么泡沫幻境里  丽诺
I don't know what bubble you're living in, Lenore,

324
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,820
可是你看到我的这个办公室了吧
but you do see my office here?

325
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,480
你看到我还没退休吧
You do see that I am not retired,

326
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,480
看到我还在工作了吧
that I am still working.

327
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,010
不怪我们  都是贾克斯干的
This wasn't us. This was Jax.

328
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,850
这是他的庞氏骗局  不是我们
This is his Ponzi scheme, not ours...

329
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,490
你想开诚布公地谈
You want to have an honest conversation here,

330
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,170
那咱就谈谈  我上周找你们
then let's have it. I came to you last week

331
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,240
想拿回我的钱  好买我梦寐以求的房子
for my money back so that I could buy my dream house,

332
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,310
-你们是怎么说的来着  -我们没
- and what did you say? - We didn't...

333
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,110
不  我想听你说出来  你当时怎么说的
No, I want to hear you say it. What did you say?

334
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,930
不怪我们
This wasn't us.

335
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,520
你说钱放在账户里别动  用它贷款
You said keep it in your account, and borrow on it.

336
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,190
我本可以拿回我的钱的
I could've had my money back.

337
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,400
我
I...

338
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,810
我觉得你该走了
I think it's a good idea that you go.

339
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,860
戴安
Diane,

340
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,080
看着我
look at me.

341
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,590
我是无辜的
I'm innocent.

342
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,420
亨利是无辜的
Henry's innocent.

343
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,670
你是一名辩护律师
You are a defense lawyer.

344
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,150
你怎么就不能把对其他客户的礼节
Why can't you extend us the same courtesy

345
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,040
延用到我们身上
you do your other clients?

346
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,100
我们是被冤枉的
We are wrongly accused.

347
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,590
不能因为联调局说什么就是什么
Just because the Feds say it doesn't make it true.

348
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,880
我会告诉玛娅你来过
I'll tell Maia that you dropped by.

349
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,900
我知道我不该提要求  但是亨利需要你帮他
I know I shouldn't ask this, but Henry needs your help.

350
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,700
他在监狱里  没人愿意探望他
He's in jail and no one will visit him.

351
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,530
他的律师建议他认罪
His lawyer's advising him to plead guilty,

352
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,320
可我觉得他不应该认
but I don't think he should.

353
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,210
他是你的老朋友了  戴安
He's your oldest friend, Diane.

354
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,840
你能跟他谈谈吗
Will you talk to him?

355
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,830
这就跟庭审差不多吗
So it's like a trial?

356
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,350
是的  如实回答就行
Yes, just answer honestly.

357
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,620
你要做的就是这个
That's all you have to do.

358
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,220
我要是输了呢
And if I lose?

359
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,160
因为没法上诉  所以输了就是输了
Well, there's no appeal, so if you lose, you lose.

360
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,220
弗兰克·格文
Frank Gwinn.

361
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,360
到
Here.

362
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,840
进吧  你是律师
Go ahead. You're the lawyer?

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,150
对  雷迪克&博斯曼&科斯达律所的
Uh, yes, from Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad...

364
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,840
好  我是仲裁员
Good, I'm the arbiter.

365
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,270

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,330
就是他审问我的

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,010
开始吧
Let's hear it.

370

下午好
Good afternoon.

372
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,450
弗兰克的雇主  BMI运动公司
Frank's employer, BMI,

373
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,010
是一家市值120亿美元的运动用品商店
a sporting good store with $12 billion in assets

374
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,910
并且在全国各地均有经营权
and franchises throughout the country...

375
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,320
我不需要听这个
Yeah, I-I don't need that.

376
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,670
好的
Right. Um...

377
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,020
他们指控我的当事人
They have accused my client of stealing

378
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,540
从库存货物中偷窃了400双跑鞋
400 running shoes from their back-stock.

379
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,490
-417双  -反对

380
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,280
好吧
Okay, um,

381
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,300
这不是他偷的  是吗
and he didn't do it, right?

382
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,250
正确  先生
Uh, that is correct, sir.

383
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,690
他没偷
He did not do it.

384
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,890
你有什么事  女士
What do you need, ma'am?

385
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,000
我来这当工会的观察员
I'm here as an observer for the union.

386
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:15,980
为什么
Why?

387
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,880
我们就是想确保一切公平公正
We just want to make sure everything's fair.

388
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,110
好吧  这位小姐请继续
Okay, keep going, Miss.

389
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,260
我的当事人并没有偷鞋
My client did not steal any shoes.

390
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,950
他没有任何犯罪记录  然而BMI运动公司
He has no record and yet the company, BMI,

391
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,610
却选择克扣他将近40%的工资
have chosen to garnish his salary by almost 40%.

392
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,290
我们什么都没克扣  他认罪了
We didn't garnish anything, he confessed.

393
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,420
不  抱歉先生  会轮到你发言的
No, excuse me, sir, you'll have your chance.

394
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,670
这就是一家规模庞大
Um, this is a massive,

395
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,550
市值1200亿的公司
$12 billion company

396
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,100
偷窃我当事人一半的工资
stealing half my client's pay.

397
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,280
偷窃  别闹  我们可有他的供状登记在案
Stealing, really? We have his confession on the record.

398
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,620
不  他是被逼招供的
No, he was forced to confess.

399
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,170
有人告诉他如果他不认罪的话
He was told if he did not confess...

400
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,120
没人跟他说过任何事情
He was not told anything.

401
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,850
如果他不招认  就会被解雇
If he did not confess, then he would be fired.

402
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,860
弗兰克  他质问了你多久
Frank, how long did this man question you? 

403
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,680
七个小时
Seven hours.

404
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,240
没有片刻休息  他被要求不能离开房间
Without break. He was told he could not leave the room.

405
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,960
只是因为他是一名员工  而他当时正在值班
Only because he's an employee and he was on the clock.

406
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,420
让我看看供词
Let me see the confession.

407
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,540
工会代表也想看看这个吗
Would the union rep like to see it, too?

408
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,140
是的  谢谢
Uh, I would, thank you.

409
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,640
仲裁员先生  在你看供词的同时  请记住
Mr. Arbiter, as you read that, please remember

410
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,880
他是被迫在这张供词上签名的
that he was forced to sign that confession.

411
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,520
我从没强迫过任何人  这是弗里德曼方法
I never forced anyone. This is the Friedman method.

412
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,620
我从未不按方法办事
I never diverged once from it at all.

413
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,300
什么
The what?

414
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,210
弗里德曼方法
The Friedman method,

415
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,380
这是一种质询方法
it's a process of questioning

416
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,330
我曾经如此训练过也得到了认证
I was trained and certified in.

417
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,340
先生  这是你的签名吗
Sir, is this your signature?

418
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,460
是的
Yes.

419
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,290
根据双方达成的
Then in exercise of powers conferred under Clause 25

420
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,250
条款中的第25条
of the agreement entered into between the parties,

421
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,900
本席宣布  被告胜诉
judgment is made in favor of the respondent.

422
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,790
等等  什么  这就完了吗
Wait, w-what? What, that's it?

423
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,440
谢谢大家  下次仲裁见
Thank you, I'll see the next arbitration.

424
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,280
但他是冤枉的
But he didn't do it!

425
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,330
下次仲裁见
I'll see the next arbitration.

426
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,620
非法监禁
False imprisonment.

427
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,760
仲裁员先生  我们请求仲裁再次开庭
Mr. Arbiter, we ask that the arbitration be reopened

428
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,000
因为被告对我当事人进行了非法监禁
based on the matter of false imprisonment.

429
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,050
拜托
Oh, come on...

430
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,690
我当事人在违背意愿的情况下被关了七小时
My client was held against his will for seven hours,

431
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,330
这直接违反了...所有法条
in direct contravention of... everything.

432
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,400
非法监禁的问题与此案无关
The issue of false imprisonment is irrelevant.

433
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,350
本席再次宣判  被告胜诉
Judgment is again made in favor of the respondent.

434
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,180
这就由不得你来判了  先生
That's not your decision to make, sir.

435
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,320
你说什么
Excuse me?

436
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,130
林德尔小姐当事人的
The arbitration agreement

437
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,960
仲裁协议并不包括民事侵权索赔
with Ms. Rindell's client does not cover tort claims.

438
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,610
而非法监禁就是一项民事侵权索赔
And false imprisonment is a tort claim.

439
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,220
那我们可就陷入僵局了
Then we are stalemated.

440
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,240
不  我们没有
No, we're not.

441
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,270
怎么没有
And why is that?

442
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,320
因为我们将会在法庭上见
Because we'll see you in court.

443
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,640
亨利
Henry.

444
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,410
你还好吗
How are you?

445
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,530
鲁珀特让我接受这份认罪协议
Rupert tells me I should accept a guilty plea.

446
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,920
20年
20 years.

447
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,740
你怎么想
What do you think?

448
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,510
我觉得很糟糕  汉克
I think this is bad, Hank.

449
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,280
是的  你和我  戴安
Yeah, you and I, Diane,

450
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,430
我们总是和对方说实话
we always told each other the truth.

451
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,120
不管在哪里  在大学  之后
No matter where... in college, after,

452
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,600
在丽诺面前
before Lenore.

453
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,540
我现在也要和你说实话
And I'm telling you the truth now.

454
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,790
我是冤枉的
I did not do this.

455
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,390
小亨  我应该怎么做
Hank, what am I supposed to do with that?

456
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,040
我破产了  分文不剩
I am bankrupted, completely.

457
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,780
两个月前  我聘请了一个法务会计师
Two months ago, I hired a forensics accountant

458
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,860
去调查贾克斯的交易
to look into Jax's trades.

459
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,220
有8300万美元不见了
There was $83 million missing.

460
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,180
那个会计师发现贾克斯把钱转移到
The accountant found Jax had moved the money

461
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,020
他的私人账户了
into his private account.

462
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,560
我试图与他对质  但还没来得及
I tried to confront him, but before I could,

463
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,260
贾克斯就去联调局告发了我
Jax went to the Feds to turn me in.

464
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,090
你应该把这些和你的律师说  不是我
You should be telling this to your lawyer, not to me.

465
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,050
我说了  但鲁珀特说此事无足轻重
I did, but Rupert said it doesn't matter.

466
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,800
对我不利的事太多了
There are too many bad facts.

467
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,570
好吧
Okay.

468
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,150
我去找找别的律师
Let me look into another lawyer.

469
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,850
-为什么不能是你  -不行
- Why not you? - No.

470
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,170
你需要一个能保持客观的人
You need someone objective.

471
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,170
玛娅还好吗
How's Maia?

472
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,840
-她做得很好  -好
- She's doing well. - Good.

473
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,370
她正在处理一个案子
She's on a case.

474
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,500
她会超越我们所有人
She's gonna blow us all away.

475
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,670
她见她妈妈了吗
Did she see her mom?

476
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,320
没有
No.

477
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,540
我觉得她最好远离这些事
I think it's best that she stay away

478
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,900
直到有个了结
until all this gets straightened out.

479
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,350
但这也许会需要很长时间
But that could be years.

480
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,900
我知道
I know.

481
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,730
丽诺没告诉你吗
Lenore didn't tell you?

482
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,660
告诉我什么
Tell me what?

483
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,630
她时间不多了
She doesn't have years.

484
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,040
她的乳腺癌复发了
Her breast cancer, it's back.

485
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,680
扩散到了淋巴结
Spread to her lymph nodes.

486
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,150
也许我该去看看她
Maybe I should go see her.

487
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,770
是我的话就先跟律师谈谈
I'd talk to your lawyer first.

488
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,050
你觉得我不应该去看她
You don't think I should go see her?

489
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,800
不  只是
No, it's just...

490
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,160
我觉得你应该谨慎一点
I think you should be careful.

491
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,770
她误解了我的意图
She misunderstood my intent,

492
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,630
也可能直接无视了  但我们没有时间纠缠这个
or she ignored it, but we just don't have time for this.

493
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,070
我们对律所的作为有更高的期待
And we raise expectations for what our firm can do!

494
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,620
卢卡
Ah, Lucca.

495
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,170
看来我们今早又有了新案子
It seems we picked up a new case this morning.

496
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,460
我和你说了我们不想
I told you we didn't want to get tangled up

497
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,700
这些小案子上纠缠不清
in small-ball litigation.

498
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,320
这并不是一个小案子
This is not small-ball.

499
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,990
BMI有120亿美元资产
BMI has $12 billion in assets...

500
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,070
是的  但我们拿不到任何惩罚性赔偿
Yes, and there won't be any punitive damages here.

501
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,290
-这可不好说  -这是一定的
- But we don't know that. - We do know that.

502
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,720
只有一个工会成员
This is one union member,

503
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,830
我们需要花40个计费工时
and we're about to put in 40 billable hours,

504
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,610
从他那得到什么  两万美元的酬劳吗
to get him what, $20,000 in back pay?

505
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,430
是让你把办公室让给了合伙人  所以在找事吗
Is this about you losing your office to a partner?

506
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,600
没有
No.

507
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,240
这就是个好案子
This is about a good case.

508
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,580
你知道弗里德曼方法是什么吗
Hey, do you know what the Friedman Method is?

509
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,850
弗里德曼方法
The Friedman Method?

510
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,410
我知道  这是一种质询
Yeah, it's a way to interrogate

511
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,870
嫌疑人的方法  怎么了
a suspect... why?

512
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,410
我有个案子
It's a case I'm on.

513
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,980
我怎么能了解更多点
How do I find out more about it?

514
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,710
简单  他们有研讨会
Easily, they have seminars.

515
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,320
去网上查找就好
Just look them up online.

516
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,760
只要你付钱  你也可以
You pay the money, and you, too,

517
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,180
学习怎么当警察
can learn how to be a cop.

518
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,620
太好了
Good to know.

519
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,790
好了  我得挂了  拜
Oh, okay. I got to go, bye.

520
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,440
我们被拒绝了
We're being shut down.

521
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,380
什么
What?

522
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,050
他们担心这案子太小了
They're worried the case is too small.

523
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,200
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

524
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,420
我正要报名弗里德曼研讨会的课程
I was just about to sign up for a Friedman seminar

525
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,780
去继续找信息呢
to find out more.

526
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,390
那就去做吧
You know what, do it anyway.

527
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,090
工时是我们自己的
It's on our time.

528
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,520
为什么不做呢
Why not?

529
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,920
好的
Okay.

530
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,680
人们会说谎
People lie.

531
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,300
当人们说谎时
And when people lie,

532
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,810
他们会想坦白  这是人的本性
they want to confess... it's human nature.

533
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,010
你们要做的  你  你  还有你
Your job... you and you and you...

534
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,400
就是促成这一过程
is to enable that process.

535
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,600
你们是他们坦白的关键步骤
You are a crucial step to their cleansing.

536
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,940
你们后面的四节课上将学习
What you will learn over the next four sessions

537
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,730
弗里德曼方法
is the Friedman method.

538
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,960
一个确认罪行并让罪犯招供的方法
A way to determine guilt and obtain a confession.

539
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,650
这四个人中有一个在撒谎
One of these four people is lying.

540
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,520
他们都不承认自己从收银台那里偷了钱
They all deny taking money from a cash register,

541
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,400
但有一个人确实偷了
but one of them did.

542
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,500
弗里德曼方法的第一步就是辨认罪行
The first step in the Friedman Method is ascertain guilt.

543
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,360
找出谁在撒谎
Find out who is lying.

544
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,370
听着  我没偷
Look, I didn't do it.

545
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,910
我根本没到那里去  是真的
I wasn't even there. That's the truth.

546
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,230
很可信  对吗
Pretty convincing, huh?

547
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,590
不要管他说了什么  
But ignore the words. 

548
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,640
这和他们有罪与否毫无关系
They're irrelevant.

549
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,540
每个人都发誓自己是无辜的
Everybody swears they're innocent,

550
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,950
但没有人能藏得住自己的脸
but no one can hide their face.

551
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,540
没有人能藏得住自己的表情
No one can hide their expressions.

552
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,660
最重要的一点是要让嫌犯
The most important thing is to get the suspect

553
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,900
直视你并重复他们的论述
to look right at you and repeat the statement

554
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,840
不断重复
over and over.

555
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,810
我们再看一遍
Let's watch it again.

556
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,170
我会慢放这段影片
I'm going to slow down the image.

557
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,070
听着  我没偷
Look, I didn't do it.

558
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,850
我根本没到那里去  我根本没到那里去
I wasn't even there... I wasn't even there.

559
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,980
-是真的  -那里
- That's the truth... - There!

560
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,670
就在那  看见没  他的嘴唇下方
Right there. See? Under his lip?

561
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,520
笑肌
The risorius muscle.

562
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,950
这是用来表达害怕的
It's part of the expression of fear.

563
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,230
当人们处于焦虑之中时
When we are experiencing anxiety,

564
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,920
笑肌会紧缩
the risorius muscle will become tense.

565
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,230
看看他有没有
Look for it.

566
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,830
我根本没到那里去
I wasn't even there.

567
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,970
-是真的  -看见没
- That's the truth. - See?

568
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,570
肌肉紧缩了
Clenched muscle.

569
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,870
好  还有一个迹象会暴露你在焦虑  前额
Good. Another telltale sign of anxiety, the forehead.

570
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,460
当焦虑爆发时
When there is a burst of anxiety,

571
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,100
这里的肌肉会变紧绷
these muscles will tighten up,

572
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,530
眉毛会向上扬  只有很短的时间  看见没
the eyebrows will rise upward, only for a second... see?

573
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,960
撒谎者想故作镇定
The liar wants to force his expressions to look relaxed,

574
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,320
控制自己的情绪
in control.

575
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,970
所以  你要找的表情
Therefore, the expression you're looking for

576
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,490
转瞬即逝  只有一瞬间
is fleeting, momentary.

577
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,120
你觉得这是真的吗  识穿骗子的方法
Do you think that's true, the way to discover a liar?

578
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,350
不是真的  只是蹩脚的心理学
No, it's bad psychology.

579
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,530
什么意思
How do you mean?

580
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,500
"不要管他说了什么"  真的吗
"Ignore the words"? Seriously?

581
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,840
不解释自己无罪的理由
How does someone prove their innocence

582
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,020
怎么能够证明自己的清白
without explaining why they're innocent?

583
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,860
而且他说只要能发觉有人在焦虑就行了
And he says it's all about detecting anxiety.

584
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,860
先别说你有没有罪
Well, I don't care how innocent you are,

585
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,730
如果被警察叫去审问
if a cop calls you in for questioning,

586
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,000
是个人都会焦虑的
you're gonna be anxious.

587
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,040
所以焦虑能证明什么
So what does anxiety prove?

588
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,630
如果没有警察呢
What if there is no cop?

589
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,210
如果在没有理由焦虑的情况下呢
What if there is no reason to be anxious?

590
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,570
我不知道  每个人都是不同的
I don't know. Everybody's different.

591
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,010
每个人有每个人的特征  我不...
Everybody's got their tell. I don't...

592
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,140
怎么了
What?

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,180
这不是一件小事
This isn't a small thing.

597
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,370
这是一起巨大的集体诉讼
This is a massive class action.

598
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,150
每一个身家上十亿的全国连锁零售商
Every multi-billion dollar nationwide retailer

599
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,740
都派了中层管理者
is sending middle-management

600
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,420
来参加这种研讨会  东翼跑鞋
to these seminars... East Wing Running Shoes,

601
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,270
广传电子  拳击百货
Widespread Tech, B&X...

602
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,480
我以为这些研讨会是关于警察培训的
I thought these seminars were about training cops.

603
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,290
这是这个研讨会的初衷
That's how they were intended,

604
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,270
但是零售商们用这个技术
but retail stores are using the same techniques

605
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,830
来对付自己的雇员
against their own employees,

606
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,920
而结果很可能会错怪好人
and it's just as likely to result in a false positive.

607
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,770
芭芭拉  你觉得怎么样
Barbara, what do you think?

608
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,370
是个好机会
It's good.

609
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,520
去定出个集体来
Go certify a class.

610
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,630
我们该派波比和她一起去
We should put Bobby on it with her.

611
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,730
现在这是件大事了
It's a big thing now.

612
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,770
现在是谁和她一起
Who's on it with her right now?

613
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,930
新来的律师  玛娅 
The new associate, Maia.

614
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,080
是我的话会让她继续跟这个案子
I'd keep her on it.

615
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,520
玛娅挺不错的
Maia's good.

616
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,320
她很积极
And she's motivated.

617
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,980
-那个林德尔家的孩子吗  -是的
- That Rindell kid? - Yes.

618
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,230
当然
Sure.

619
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,510
所有人都恨她
Everybody hates her.

620
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,360
这是一个激发斗志的绝妙机遇
Great way to mold a fighter.

621
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,110
好吧
All right.

622
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,100
这个位置可能不会招人了
There may not even be a job here.

623
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,290
我只是想提醒一下你们
I just want to warn you.

624
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,600
你是来应聘助理职位的吗
Uh, you're here for the assistant position?

625
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,720
请进  你是丹妮拉吗
Come on in... Daniela?

626
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,350
请坐
Have a seat.

627
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,760
这还是你的案子  弗兰克
This is still your case, Frank,

628
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,700
但现在也是集体诉讼了
but it's also now a class action.

629
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,740
也就是说我不用付钱了
So I don't pay anything?

630
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,900
对  你有更大的希望
Right, and it's more likely

631
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,680
得到更多赔偿
that you'll get a larger settlement,

632
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,010
因为这些都是大公司
because these big companies

633
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,240
大公司都不想破坏自己的形象
will want to avoid the embarrassment.

634
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,260
这得搞快点
Is this going to move quickly now,

635
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,690
因为我现在连房租都交不起了
because I'm having trouble paying rent.

636
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,100
我们认为这些公司会想办法驳回上诉
We think the companies will try to win this motion to dismiss.

637
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,620
如果做不到  他们就会协商和解
And if not, they'll negotiate a settlement.

638
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,190
-好吧  我要签什么协议吗  -要的
- All right, do I have to sign something? - Yes.

639
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,260
你可以帮到我们  弗兰克
And, actually, you can help us, Frank.

640
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,360
我们要找其他和你一样
We're looking for other workers

641
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,410
被克扣工资的员工
who have had their wages garnished, just like you.

642
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,460
-如果你...  -这个案子是什么来着
- So, if you... - What is this case again?

643
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,260
我们要召集一群被诬陷
We're gathering a class of retail workers

644
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,820
偷了店里东西的零售员工
who were wrongly accused of stealing from their stores.

645
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,120
好了  明白了
Okay, got it.

646
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,800
你要回来工作了吗
So are you coming back to work?

647
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,080
大家都很想念你
Everybody misses you.

648
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,250
不了  我找了别的工作
No, I got another job.

649
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,910
你能帮我个忙吗
In fact, can you help me out with it?

650
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,340
这里的人你都认识
You know everybody around here.

651
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,760
这里有谁被扣了工资吗
Is there anybody in the mall who had their wages cut?

652
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,890
我们要对所有的混蛋大公司提起诉讼
We're bringing a lawsuit against all these big asshole companies,

653
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,030
我知道这里的人你都认识
and I know you know all the people here

654
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,190
他们的不满你都清楚
and how they complain.

655
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,210
有谁在抱怨自己的工钱吗
So is anybody bitching about their paychecks?

656
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,110
就是有人被强迫承认
It's about people being forced to confess

657
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,110
自己偷了衣服或者鞋子或者电脑
that they stole clothing or shoes or computers.

658
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,150
如果你听到了什么消息  这是我的名片
So if you hear anything from anybody, here's my card.

659
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,420
让他们打给我
Tell them to call me.

660
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,270
你在干什么  芭芭拉
What the hell are you doing, Barbara?

661
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,160
我在干什么  我在吃三明治
What am I doing? I'm having a sandwich.

662
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,700
你在拉我的会员提起集体诉讼
You're dragging my members into a class action.

663
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,380
如果你说的是克扣工资的事的话
If this is about the salary garnishing,

664
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,220
我们没有拉...
we're not drag...

665
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,940
你惹到管理层了
You're pissing off management!

666
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,770
我们正处在协商合同的节骨眼上
We're on the eve of a contract negotiation,

667
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,090
你却惹恼了管理层
and you're pissing off management.

668
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,900
是有工会成员来投诉
It was a union-member complaint.

669
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,260
-我们只是...  -不不不
- We are merely... - No, no, no, no.

670
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,440
是你们说服他
You convinced him

671
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,900
发起集体诉讼的
to pursue a class action,

672
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,220
就因为你们想要钱
because you wanted the money.

673
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,990
你们的人跑进我们的办公室寻求帮助
You came into our offices and asked for our help

674
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,230
就为了发起集体...
to collect a class...

675
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,180
就是她们两个
Those two did.

676
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,790
-你们和我们是有合约的  -没错
- Your contract is with us. - Yes.

677
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,890
而你们雇我们也是为了帮助成员和...
And you employed us to help your members and...

678
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,900
那只是做个样子而已
As a gesture, merely.

679
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,150
或许你们的成员想要知道这件事情吧
Uh, maybe your members would like to know that.

680
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,290
你是认真的吗
Seriously?

681
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,550
我们之间的合约就这么没有意义吗
That's how little our contract means to you?

682
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,380
你们居然在威胁我
You're threatening me?

683
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,400
天呐  如果那都算威胁  朋友
God, if that's considered a threat, friend,

684
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,860
我可真想活在你的纯真世界里
I would love to live in your world.

685
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,430
这起集体诉讼  我们一分钱都不会给
We won't pay a cent for this class action,

686
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,650
我们也不会提供任何协助
and we won't help in any way.

687
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,840
快放弃这个案子
So drop it.

688
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,750
你要怎么做
What are you gonna do?

689
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,410
我们去另找一个赞助人吧
We're gonna find another benefactor.

690
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,480
你手里有什么案子
So what do you have?

我们正在征集
We're gathering that as we speak,

原告人数不足  没有工会帮忙
The class. Without the union's help,

745
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,900
我们很难找到那些
we're having a little trouble locating employees

746
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,980
被抵扣工资的雇员
with garnished wages.

747
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,160
去查查犯罪报告
Check crime reports.

-他们就会上报的不是吗  -不行  他们试过了
- they'd report it, right? - No. They tried that.

750
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,830
那就去发传单  到网上查
Let's post fliers. Let's check Reddit.

751
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,790
发挥创造力  我已经和资金合伙人说
Let's get creative. I've told our financial partners

that we would have 20 members in the class, so let's get to it,

754
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,460
指控偷窃并被扣薪水的员工资料

还有十几个备选的
And I have feelers out to a dozen more.

756
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,510
外面还有两个人等着进来面试
And there are two more people here to be interviewed.

757
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,160
她是谁
Who is that?

758
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,800
我的新助理
My new assistant.

759
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,810
{\an8}凯文·德拉戈法官

760
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,810
你想让我回避此案
You want me to recuse myself?

761
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,830
很遗憾是的  法官阁下  
Yes, Your Honor. Regretfully.

762
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,080
你不喜欢我吗  律师
You don't like me, Counselor?

763
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,250
不会啊  我很喜欢您
No, I love you.

764
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,630
在我们律所  大家都对您赞誉有加
At our firm, we speak very highly of you

765
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,090
一直如此  法官阁下
all the time, Your Honor.

766
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,670
但不幸的是  在本案中
But unfortunately, in this instance,

767
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,020
存在利益冲突
there is a conflict of interest.

768
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,290
我们没问题  法官阁下
We're good here, Your Honor.

769
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,440
一点问题都没有
No problem.

770
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,640
这不就是个驳回指控的动议嘛
Isn't this just a motion to dismiss?

771
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,810
我不明白我能与此案有什么利益冲突
I'm not sure how I can be conflicted out.

772
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,730
我在BMI的门店买过东西  也就这样
I've shopped at BMI, but that's about it.

773
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,810
你呢  先生
And you, sir?

774
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,130
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

775
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,310
不认识  法官阁下
No, Your Honor.

776
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,110
你已经尽力了  博斯曼先生
Nice try, Mr. Boseman,

777
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,390
但我还是要驳回你想让我回避此案的动议
but I reject your motion to recuse me.

778
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,870
可以开始传唤你方的第一位证人了
We can start with your first witness.

779
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,080
法官阁下  其实还有一件事
Actually, Your Honor, there's one more thing.

780
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,270
你是在挑战我的耐心  先生
You're trying my patience, sir.

781
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,440
最近您在一次投资中亏损了超过100万美元
Recently you lost over a million dollars in an investment.

782
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,320
我说得没错吧
Am I correct?

783
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,430
那不关你事
That's none of your business.

784
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,640
我的损失也和本案没有任何关系
And that loss has nothing to do with the matter here.

785
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,840
快坐下
Now sit down.

786
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,080
不幸的是  我方的次席律师...
But unfortunately, our second chair here...

787
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,760
玛娅  你能站起来把全名说出来吗
Uh, Maia, would you stand up and state your full name please?

788
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,130
玛娅·林德尔
Maia Rindell.

789
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,190
如您所见  法官阁下
As you can see, Your Honor,

790
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,270
因为您在林德尔德庞氏骗局中
since you've lost most of your savings

791
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,270
损失了绝大多数积蓄
to the Rindell Ponzi scheme,

792
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,220
所以您无法公正地判决此案
you cannot fairly judge this case.

793
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,570
{\an8}查尔斯·阿勃纳西法官

794
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,610
我们在这个美好的周三下午相聚在这里
So here we all are on this lovely Wednesday afternoon.

795
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,150
只可惜  我恰巧没找着
And unfortunately, I have misplaced

796
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,850
我的处方眼镜
my prescription glasses.

797
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,500
所以我只能戴着这副处方墨镜了
So I will try to make do with these prescription sunglasses,

798
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,180
希望你们别介意我看着跟个电影明星似的
if you don't mind me looking a little bit like a movie star.

799
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,450
您戴着真好看  法官阁下
Very becoming, Your Honor.

800
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,090
没那么夸张啦
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

801
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,190
我来自洛杉矶  已经习惯这种装扮了
Coming from L.A., I'm used to it.

802
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,610
洛杉矶
Ah, Los Angeles.

803
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,030
你们那边旱情如何
How is your drought?

804
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,160
正在好转
Uh, improving.

805
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,420
很好  我很喜欢你们州
Good. I love the way your state

806
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,990
重视绿色能源的种种举措
emphasizes green energy.

807
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,820
是的  我自己就有一辆特斯拉
Yes, I have a Tesla myself.

808
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,310
真是辆好车
It's such a wonderful car.

809
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,080
法官阁下  我们在谈驳回起诉的动议
Your Honor, the motion to dismiss.

810
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,990
是的  谢谢  卢卡
Yes, thank you, Lucca.

811
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,590
本案中的简明事实是原告试图用
The simple fact is the plaintiff is attempting to use

812
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,120
其从我的委托人处盗窃400双跑鞋一案
the theft of 400 running shoes from my client's...

813
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,880
并非盗窃案  本次诉讼并未涉及盗窃案
Not the theft. There is no theft here.

814
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,400
请允许我说完  谢谢
If I could finish? Thank you.

815
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,760
起诉15家受人尊敬的公司
To sue 15 respected companies.

816
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
换句话说  这是个特洛伊木马
In other words, this is a Trojan Horse...

817
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,630
实际上  我会选用的比喻  法官阁下
Actually, the metaphor I would use, Your Honor,

818
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,250
-是劫贫济富的罗宾汉  -你是认真的吗
- is a reverse Robin Hood. - Seriously?

819
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,930
争论开始激烈起来了
Well, this is getting heated.

820
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,190
我的当事人一年挣四万美元
My client makes $40,000 a year.

821
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,410
史蒂文斯女士的委托人年入130亿美元
Ms. Stevens' client makes $13 billion.

822
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,430
然而每次发工资的时候
And yet every payday,

823
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,470
他们会从他的实得工资中扣除40%
they take 40% of his take home pay.

824
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:26,500
好了  那么战线已经很明了了
Okay, well, battle lines drawn.

825
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,880
史蒂文斯女士  传你的第一位证人
Ms. Stevens, your, your first witness.

826
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,740
我们的库房发生过很多盗窃事件
We had a lot of theft from the store-room,

827
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,090
今年损失了约60万美元
almost $600,000 this year.

828
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,400
所以我被指派来对雇员进行问询
So I was asked to question the employees.

829
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,150
你为什么会锁定原告呢
And why did you zero in on the plaintiff?

830
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,730
根据弗里德曼方法  他表现出了欺骗的迹象
He showed signs of deception per the Friedman method.

831
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,320
这是一种被警察用来
This is a method utilized by the police

832
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,020
-审讯嫌疑人的方法吗  -是的
- to question suspects? - Yes.

833
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,500
-被告签署了这份认罪书吗  -是的
- And the plaintiff signed this confession? - Yes. 

834
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,540
他清楚地和我们交代了他是如何偷偷地把货箱
He told us exactly how he slipped the crates into his car,

835
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,300
装入了他的车里并将其运到了麦斯威尔街市集
took them down to Maxwell Street Market, 

836
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,280
以一万美元的价格卖给了一位供应商
and sold them to a vendor for $10,000. 

837
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,140
谢谢  帝亚蒂安先生
Thank you, Mr. Diyardian.

838
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,200
-那信息是他给我的  -我问完了  法官阁下
- He gave me that information. - Nothing more here, Your Honor.

839
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,410
迈克  你能把屏幕再多转过来点吗
Mike, could you angle that screen some more?

840
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,430
这幅太阳镜是偏光镜
These sunglasses are polarized.

841
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,700
是的  继续转  再转一点
Yeah, keep coming, keep coming. Ah.

842
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,610
继续  再转一点
Keep coming, keep coming.

843
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,620
好了
Oh, well...

844
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,430
请继续
Uh, continue, please.

845
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,410
就问你几个问题  班吉
Uh, just a few questions, Benji.

846
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,250
这起盗窃案你为什么不报警呢
Why didn't you tell the police about the theft?

847
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,090
抱歉你说什么
Excuse me?

848
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,770
如果是我有价值七万美元的货品被窃
Well, if it were me and I had $70,000 stolen,

849
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,420
我会去报警的
I would go to the police.

850
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,510
公司更愿意将这些事情内部解决掉
Well, the company would rather settle these things internally.

851
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,870
另外我更希望你叫我"帝亚蒂安先生"
And I'd rather you call me "Mr. Diyardian."

852
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,700
抱歉
Oh, my apologies.

853
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,320
那么根据你的审讯结果
And Mr. Gwinn stole this $70,000,

854
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,020
格文先生盗走了这七万美元货品吗
according to your interrogation?

855
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,210
我的问询
My interview.

856
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,210
是的  你的问询
Right, your interview.

857
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,220
在你印象里  弗兰克·格文就是个贼  对吗
To your mind, Frank Gwinn is a thief, right?

858
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,510
他偷东西  是的
Well, he stole, yes.

859
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,280
那为什么公司不解雇他
Then why didn't the company fire him?

860
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,300
法官阁下  我觉得BMI公司因为
Your Honor, I-I think it's a little odd that BMI

861
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,330
其所做出的人道主义行为而被指责有点奇怪
is being censured for doing the humanitarian thing.

862
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,020
我不认为原告是在指责他们
Oh, I don't think plaintiff is censuring them.

863
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,110
我觉得她只是很奇怪他们会留着小偷
I think she just finds it odd that they kept the thief

864
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,110
公继续当员工  我也有同感
on staff, as do I.

865
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,250
公司只是想有个能追回损失的
Well, the company just wanted an opportunity to claw back

866
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,710
-机会  不是吗  -没错  是的
- its losses, didn't it? - Right, it did.

867
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,410
所以公司继续雇佣弗兰克
So the company wanted to keep Frank employed

868
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,800
这样他们就能从他的工资里扣钱了
so they could take from his paycheck?

869
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,910
-是这样吗  -我是不会这样表述的
- Is that right? - Well, that's not how I'd put it.

870
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,070
那你想如何表述  班吉  别急慢慢想
How would you put it, Benji? Please take your time.

871
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,950
你是在暗示这其中存在不良动机
You're suggesting bad motives here.

872
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,210
但是BMI公司认为它的所有雇员
But BMI thinks all its employees

873
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,780
都应该被允许改过自新
should be allowed to make things right.

874
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,420
那么因此  即使弗兰克
And so, even though, Frank,

875
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,490
据传偷窃了七万美元的货品
supposedly stole $70,000,

876
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,340
他依然被允许在无监管的情况下
he was still allowed to work alone

877
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,890
独自一人在库房里工作吗
and unsupervised in the backroom?

878
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,710
反对  重复问题
Objection. Asked and answered.

879
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,680
实际上  不是  我想听听他的回答
Uh, actually, no, I'd like to hear the answer.

880
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,990
我们信任我们的雇员
We trust our employees.

881
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,610
这就是你为什么对他进行了七小时的问询吗
And that's why you questioned him for seven hours? - 

882
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,010
反对  诱导性问题
Objection. Argumentative.

883
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:38,950
我换个问法
I'll rephrase.

884
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,840
你对我的委托人进行了多久的问询
 How many hours did you question my client?

885
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,330
我不知道  我没计时
I don't know. I didn't keep track.

886
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,620
那个
Well, uh...

887
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,470
这上面写着七个小时
uh, it says seven hours here.

888
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,930
你好  卢卡  很高兴看到你还在这里
Oh, hello, Lucca. Good to see you're still at it.

889
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,960
而这位是  玛  抱歉
And it's um... Mai... I'm sorry,

890
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,160
-米娅  -玛娅
- Mia. - Maia.

891
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,940
-玛娅  谢谢  你好  -你好
- Maia, thank you. Hi. - Hi.

892
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,140
我是安德莉亚
I'm Andrea.

893
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,200
你家里发生的事情我深表遗憾
I'm so terribly sorry about your family.

894
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,620
对你来说一定很难熬
Must be hard on you.

895
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,690
还是可控的
It's manageable.

896
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,710
可控的
Manageable.

897
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,740
很好
Good.

898
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,390
女性正一点点接管这个世界
Women are taking over the world, piece by piece.

899
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,580
我在想我们俩什么时候可以聊聊  卢卡
Um, I'm wondering if you and I could talk sometime, Lucca.

900
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,750
我们现在就可以聊
We can talk right now.

901
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,470
我只是
Well, I-I just

902
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,750
不喜欢在公共场合这么做  不过
hate doing it here in a public place, but...

903
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,420
那么  你们的价格是多少
So, what's the offer?

904
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,910
价格
Offer?

905
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,680
不  我只是想知道你是在哪理的发
No, I-I just wanted to know where you got your hair cut.

906
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,280
我只是很喜欢你的刘海
I just, I love the bangs so much.

907
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,740
我一个朋友给我理的
A friend of mine.

908
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,290
-她在她的公寓里给人理发  -真的吗
- She cuts hair out of her apartment. - Really?

909
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,880
你能把她的电话给我吗
Could you maybe get me her number?

910
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,500
-当然可以  -谢谢
- Sure. - Thank you.

911
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,090
天啊  顺便说下  我很喜欢你这条项链
Gosh. Mm. I love this, by the way.

912
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,530
你戴上一定会很好看
It would look great on you.

913
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,580
你想买吗
Do you want to buy it?

914
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,480
不
No.

915
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,780
我宁愿把笑容从蒙娜丽莎脸上买走
I'd sooner buy the smile off the Mona Lisa.

916
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,320
明天见
See you tomorrow.

917
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,740
再见  米娅
Bye, Mia.

918
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,010
{\an8}你妈妈来了

919
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,810
只是有这个担心
It was just a scare.

920
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,370
特罗特医生发现了另一处肿块
Dr. Trotter found another lump.

921
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,800
但他认为应该是良性的
But he thinks it's nothing.

922
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,650
-很好  -这就是你打电话的原因吗
- Good. - Is that why you called?

923
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,450
是的  我听说癌症
Oh, yes, I mean, I was told the cancer

924
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,880
转移到了你的淋巴结上
had spread to your lymph nodes.

925
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,130
那是我们担心的情况
Well, that's the fear.

926
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,850
见到你真好  玛娅
It's good to see you, Maia.

927
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,380
你看起来长大了
You look older.

928
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,240
看着我  妈妈
Look at me, Mom.

929
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,130
为什么
Why?

930
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,860
我只想问你几个问题
I just want to ask you a few questions.

931
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:48,480
玛娅  我上两周回答的问题
Oh, Maia, I spent the last two weeks answering more questions

932
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,710
比我这辈子答过的都多
than I have in my whole life.

933
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,020
是的  而我是你女儿
Yes. And I am your daughter.

934
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,910
我只是想再多问你几个
And I just want to ask you a few more.

935
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,280
看着我
Look at me.

936
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,710
好的  我看着你
Okay, I'm looking at you.

937
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,670
医生真的担心过癌症复发吗
Was there really a cancer scare?

938
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,750
是的  宝贝
Yes, baby,

939
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,570
的确有担心
there was a cancer scare.

940
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,400
你没有骗我
And you're not lying to me?

941
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,500
我是你母亲
I'm your mother.

942
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,170
爸爸是清白的吗
Is Dad guilty?

943
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,530
你知道他是清白的
You know he's not.

944
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,800
你呢
Are you guilty?

945
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,200
不  玛娅  我也是
No, Maia, I'm not guilty.

946
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,100
有罪的是贾克斯叔叔
Uncle Jax is guilty.

947
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,760
你只要相信我  宝贝
You just need to trust me, baby.

948
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,950
我们是一家人
We're family.

949
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,390
我不知道她有没有说谎
I don't know if she's lying or not.

950
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,500
你是说癌症的事吗
About the cancer?

951
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,450
不  基金的事
No, about the fund.

952
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,350
你觉得是你爸做的吗
Do you think your dad did it?

953
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,090
我不知道
I don't know.

954
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,340
我们家一直风平浪静
We were always the boring family.

955
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,630
我是说
I mean,

956
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,820
我朋友们...
all my friends, their...

957
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,440
他们的父母要么离婚
their parents were divorcing

958
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,850
要么外遇...
or having affairs and...

959
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:14,300
我以前还编造父母吵架的故事
I used to lie about Mom and Dad fighting,

960
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,940
好让自己显得不那么奇怪
so that I wouldn't seem so weird.

961
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,080
如今
And now...

962
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,140
好像在为那些年的幸福还债
it's like we're paying for all those years of happiness.

963
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,710
那是你父母
That's your parents.

964
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,420
你不必如此
Doesn't have to be you.

965
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,660
你可以过得很幸福
You can be as happy as you want.

966
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,220
我们继续
And we're back.

967
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,380
问题是  年轻人
Now, here's the thing, young man.

968
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,760
不用  都坐吧
No, you can all sit down.

969
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,010
我有个问题问你
I have a question for you.

970
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,040
什么叫旋后
What is supination?

971
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,530
我昨天去买跑鞋
I was buying running shoes yesterday

972
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,030
他们说我脚掌旋后
and they told me my feet supinate?

973
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,310
旋后是说
Yeah, uh, supination

974
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,450
你跑步时脚掌外翻
is when your feet roll outward when you run.

975
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,460
-这样不好吗  -可以这么说
- Oh, and that's a bad thing? - Yes, it can be a bad thing.

976
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,250
所以你需要更坚实的外鞋底
But that's why you need shoes with a firmer outer sole.

977
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,990
像这种鞋吗
Ah. Shoes like these?

978
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,430
法官阁下  我们有证人要请出
Uh, Your Honor, um, we do have a witness,

979
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,480
但如果您对原告有同情心
but if you're feeling biased towards the plaintiff,

980
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,870
那我们请求允许申请回避
we ask that we be heard on a recusal.

981
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,050
不  律师
No, no. No, counselor.

982
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,610
我只是寻求建议
I'm just getting some advice.

983
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,710
抱歉
My apologies.

984
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,880
脚掌旋后还是旋内  我都不偏向任何一方
I will work hard toward neither supinating

985
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,630
会公正审判
nor pronating toward one side or the other.

986
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,090
下位证人
Your next witness.

987
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,100
审讯者只是要让说谎者
The interviewer merely tries to ease the way

988
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,330
更容易承认事实而已
for a liar to admit the truth, that's all.

989
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,460
所以你试着简化案件
So you tend to minimize the crime?

990
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,620
是的
Yes.

991
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,560
根据帝亚蒂安的证词
According to Mr. Diyardian's own testimony,

992
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,680
他对疑犯说的很清楚
he made it clear to the suspect

993
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,320
偷盗不是大事
that the theft was not a big matter.

994
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,680
公司只想解决问题
They just wanted to solve it.

995
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,980
事实上  他能理解人为何会被诱惑
In fact, he could understand why someone would be tempted.

996
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,350
他自己都觉得受诱惑
He was even tempted.

997
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,850
原告暗示过
And the plaintiff has suggested

998
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,120
帝亚蒂安先生把跳蚤市场的
that Mr. Diyardian handed all the details

999
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,070
所有销售细节交给了弗兰克·格文先生
of the flea market sale to Mr. Gwinn?

1000
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,010
是的  但这只是审讯法的一部分
Yes, but that's just part of our method.

1001
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,440
让疑犯明白
Making it clear to the suspect

1002
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,330
你知道他所有的犯罪事实
you know all the particulars of his crime

1003
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,080
让他觉得不被发现是不可能的
helps him feel there is no way to avoid detection.

1004
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,600
警察也是运用同样的方法
And this is the same method used by police

1005
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,640
去抓罪犯的吗
to catch criminals?

1006
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,440
是的  当然  此方法已经过测试
Yes, definitely. It is tried and tested.

1007
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,670
我说完了  法官阁下
All done here, Your Honor.

1008
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,230
你想来询问吗
Do you want to do it?

1009
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,450
你不想的话
Well, if you don't want to.

1010
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,170
不不  我想
No. No, I want to.

1011
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,370
勒弗奈先生
Mr. Le Frenais.

1012
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,350
是拉弗奈
La Frenais.

1013
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,750
拉弗奈
La Frenais.

1014
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,230
在你的方法里
Is it part of your method

1015
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,760
可以欺骗嫌疑人对吗
that you can lie to the suspect?

1016
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,160
抱歉  律师  能大点声吗
Sorry, Counselor. You, uh... Can you speak up?

1017
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,980
丽萨可能听不清
I think that Lisa is having problems hearing you.

1018
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,630
当然
Yes. Of course.

1019
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,750
先生  在你的方法里
Is it part of your Friedman method, sir,

1020
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,310
可以欺骗受审讯的嫌疑人吗
that you can lie to the suspect being questioned?

1021
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,970
好多了  谢谢
Whoa. Much better, thank you.

1022
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,690
那不是我的方法
It's not part of my method.

1023
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,760
是最高法院决定的  弗雷泽对卡普一案
It's part of the Supreme Court decision, Frazier v. Cupp.

1024
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,120
警察可以欺骗疑犯
Police officers can lie to suspects.

1025
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,820
那么你方法的第五步
And so in step number five of your method,

1026
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,740
盘问者可以向疑犯展示
the interviewer is to present evidence of culpability

1027
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,010
犯罪证据  无论真实与否
to the suspect, whether it's true or not?

1028
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,640
当然  证据最好是真实的
Well, it's better if the evidence is true, of course.

1029
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,780
但可以不真实
But it doesn't have to be?

1030
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,790
没错
No.

1031
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,810
所以当班吉让弗兰克·格文看
So when Benji presented Frank

1032
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:30,740
偷价值七万美金跑步鞋的
with a DVD recording of him stealing

1033
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,240
录像带时
the $70,000 in running shoes...

1034
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,870
事实上录像带是空白的
a DVD that was completely blank,

1035
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,040
顺便说一句
by the way...

1036
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,910
你觉得这么做没问题吗
that was A-okay with you?

1037
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:45,350
没问题  如果可以找出窃贼
Yes, if it helps find a crook, yes.

1038
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,030
但用你的方法不是出现过
But doesn't your method result

1039
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:48,660
虚假供述吗
in false confessions?

1040
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,040
很少
Very few.

1041
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,330
事实上  你的方法
In fact, hasn't your method

1042
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,960
不是在加拿大和英格兰
been banned by police

1043
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,360
被警方禁用了吗
in Canada and England?

1044
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,350
不能叫被禁  他们选择不使用而已
I wouldn't call it banned. They've chosen not to use it.

1045
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,610
因为有太多虚假供述
Oh, because it resulted in too many false confessions?

1046
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:02,830
这样说不公平
I don't think that's fair.

1047
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,920
但这是事实吧  先生
But is it true, sir?

1048
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,280
留给大家分析吧
I'll leave that analysis to others.

1049
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,670
分析  这...
Analysis. What...

1050
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:12,830
弗里德曼方法
"The Friedman Method

1051
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,690
这一审讯方法
"is a banned coercive technique of interrogation

1052
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:19,080
导致太多虚假供述
"that results in too many false confessions.

1053
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,020
因此在我们的司法系统中禁用
"It is therefore banned within our jurisdiction."

1054
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,650
你是说这样的分析吗
Do you mean analysis like that?

1055
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,770
这是谁写的
Who wrote that?

1056
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,100
梅丽萨·斯塔
Melissa Starr.

1057
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,040
苏格兰场的伦敦警察
London Metropolitan Police. Scotland Yard.

1058
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,100
好的
Okay.

1059
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,170
还有问题吗
Anything further?

1060
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,010
没有了  法官阁下
Nothing here, Your Honor.

1061
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:38,900
谢谢
Thank you.

1062
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,630
你好  戴安·洛哈特办公室
Hi. This is Diane Lockhart's office,

1063
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,620
我是她助理  梅丽莎  有何需要
and I'm her assistant, Marissa. How may I help you?

1064
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,680
是港湾医院医院的安斯沃斯医生
It's Dr. Ainsworth at Harbor Hospital.

1065
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,480
-你要给他回电吗  -麻烦了
- Do you want to call him back? - Please.

1066
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,600
戴安  那些申请人你都不喜欢吗
Diane. You didn't like any of the applicants?

1067
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,120
助理申请人吗
Oh, for the assistant's job?

1068
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,740
不  我喜欢  只是我认识梅丽莎
Uh, no, I did. It's just that I know Marissa,

1069
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,720
她很机灵  很不错
and she's on the ball. She's good.

1070
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,860
你也会看到的
You'll see.

1071
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,570
好吧  这是我们的和解方案
Okay. This is our offer.

1072
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,470
我们同意支付弗兰克·格文50万
$500,000 to Frank Gwinn.

1073
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,580
无集体诉讼
No class action.

1074
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,270
如果贵司坚持集体诉讼
If the firm pursues a class action,

1075
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:34,400
赔偿提议作废  弗兰克一毛钱没有
our offer goes away and Frank gets nothing.

1076
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,260
对于一年赚四万块的人来说这笔钱不少了
Lot of money for a guy pulling in 40 grand a year.

1077
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,770
你觉得怎么样  玛娅
What do you think of that, Maia?

1078
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,780
我觉得  我们之后会再联系你
I think we'll have to get back to you.

1079
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,980
好
Okay.

1080
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,340
在接下来  两个小时内给答复
In the next, uh, two hours,

1081
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,770
不然我们继续法庭见  而我会打败你们
or we go back to court, and destroy you.

1082
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,590
史蒂文斯女士
Ms. Stevens.

1083
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:04,060
-什么  -我现在就可以给你答复
- Yeah. - I have an answer for you now.

1084
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,490
太好了
Oh. Great.

1085
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,250
我发型师的电话号码
My hair stylist's number.

1086
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,560
怎么办
Well?

1087
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,810
我们得做个决定
We got a decision to make.

1088
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,960
不  这钱都不够给我们分的
No. It's not enough money for us to take.

1089
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,090
这不是你说了算的  客户才能决定
It's not your decision. It's the client's.

1090
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,930
不  这是集体决定的答复  
No. It's a decision for the whole class:

1091
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,130
所有24个客户
all 24 clients.

1092
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,960
算法显示我们要继续战斗下去
The algorithm says we stay in.

1093
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,300
疯了吧
This is crazy.

1094
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,120
你不能让他们去决定我们去做什么
You can't have them decide what we do.

1095
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,300
卢卡  账单是他们付
They're paying the bills, Lucca.

1096
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,630
你说得对  但是弗兰克需要这笔钱
Yes, but Frank needs the money.

1097
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,490
如果我们说不  他可能最终一个子都没
If we pass on this, he could get nothing.

1098
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,650
又或者最终得到更多
Or he could get a whole lot more.

1099
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,200
我们走一步看一步吧
Let's just wait and see.

1100
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,190
我只问你最后一个问题  弗兰克
I just have one last question for you, Frank.

1101
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,100
你为什么要认罪呢
Why did you confess?

1102
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,260
如果你没做  为什么要认罪
If you didn't do it, then why would you confess?

1103
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,490
他做出了我别无选择的样子
He made it seem like it was the only way out.

1104
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,110
他有我犯罪的DVD证据
He had a DVD of me doing it.

1105
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,570
如果你明知道DVD里什么都没有
And if you knew there was nothing on that DVD,

1106
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,260
为什么要认罪
then why would you confess?

1107
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,230
我觉得很无助
I felt helpless.

1108
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,440
我累了
I was exhausted.

1109
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,330
他让我相信我只是暂时失忆了
He had me convinced that I just repressed the memory.

1110
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,880
他说他有个证人宣誓说
He said he had a witness who swore

1111
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,900
看到我去了跳蚤市场卖鞋
that I was down at a flea market, selling the shoes.

1112
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,370
-你有吗  -没有
- Were you? - No. 

1113
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,340
但是他说如果我没有向公司坦白一切
But he said he was gonna give all this to the cops

1114
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,570
他就要把这些都交给警察
if I didn't come clean to the company.

1115
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,230
坦白一切是指
Come clean, meaning?

1116
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,780
在他写的声明上签字
Sign this statement that he wrote up.

1117
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,950
-你签了吗  -我签了
- And so you signed it? - Yes. 

1118
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,340
他说我能保住工作
He said that I could keep my job,

1119
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,520
他说对我的疑虑会消散
he said that the questioning would be over.

1120
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,770
他说我仍然有望晋升管理层
He said that I would still be on management track.

1121
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,090
你知道每多一个人向班吉自白
Did you know that Benji gets a bonus

1122
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,530
班吉就多一份奖金吗
for every employee he gets to confess?

1123
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,030
反对  无事实根据
Objection. No foundation.

1124
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:38,140
绝对反对有效
Uh, that is definitely sustained.

1125
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,180
好了  我觉得
Okay, um, I think

1126
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,550
我对此动议有裁定了
I'm ready to rule on this motion.

1127
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,170
法官阁下  我想要盘问证人
Uh, Your Honor, i'd like to cross-examine.

1128
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,610
这不是全面庭审
This is not a full trial.

1129
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,150
这不过是驳回起诉动议的裁定罢了
This is merely a motion to dismiss.

1130
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,700
是的我知道  但是这是刚到我们手上的信息
Yeah, I know, but this information just came into our hands.

1131
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,160
我们本来希望在庭审用上它的
We were hoping to use it at trial,

1132
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,130
但是我们认为如果我们现在就能用上的话
but we think we can save the court a lot of time and money

1133
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,820
可以为法庭省下很多时间和金钱
if we could ask it now.

1134
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,590
我心动了
I... am enticed.

1135
00:48:58,590 --> 00:48:59,880
谢谢您  法官阁下
Thank you, Your Honor.

1136
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:04,640
格文先生  你入职BMI之前在哪个公司工作
Mr. Gwinn, where did you work before BMI?

1137
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,360
很多公司  我是临时工
Various places. I worked as a temp.

1138
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,780
有其中一个公司叫拖乐森会计师事务所吗
And was one these places Tolleson Accounting?

1139
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,970
-有  -你在那里当过文员吗
- Yes. - You had a clerical job there?

1140
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,710
我当这是说是了
I'll take that as a yes.

1141
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,480
你有被要求自动离职吗
And were you asked to leave?

1142
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,050
不是我做的
I didn't do it.

1143
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,440
我想你知道接下来的问题了  弗兰克
Yeah. I think you know what's coming, Frank.

1144
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,700
有一个备用金账户
There was a petty cash situation,

1145
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,570
几百块的样子对吧
several hundred dollars?

1146
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,420
你被控诉私自挪用吗
And were you accused of taking it?

1147
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,660
我告诉他们钱不是我拿的
I told them I didn't take it.

1148
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,670
然而你同意说如果他们不报警
But you agreed to leave

1149
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,070
你就离职对吗
if they didn't call the cops?

1150
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,070
反对  无记录
Objection, there is no record of this.

1151
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,660
我们的调查员已经询问过此事了
Our investigators questioned this business.

1152
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,290
是的  因为当时的经理
Yes, because the manager at the time

1153
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:42,070
只和我们的调查员说过这件事
talked only to our investigator,

1154
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,390
并签下了宣誓书
and signed this affidavit.

1155
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:45,360
我没做过  
I didn't do it. 

1156
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,300
宣誓书里  当时的经理宣誓弗兰克
In it, he swears that Frank took the money,

1157
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,420
拿了那笔备用金  后来他被抓时保证
then when he was caught, promised to return it

1158
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,200
只要他们保密  他就归还
if they kept the theft secret.

1159
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,190
他说谎
That's a lie!

1160
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,800
彻头彻尾的谎言
That's a complete and total lie.

1161
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:56,260
好的  我会把这个信息
Okay. That is information

1162
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,950
纳入考量
I will take into consideration.

1163
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,660
被告有其他问题吗
Does the defendant have any more questions?

1164
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,840
没有了  法官阁下
Nothing more, Your Honor.

1165
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,440
除非原告还有其他问题
Unless the plaintiff has anything more,

1166
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:04,460
不然我就对动议进行裁定了
I will rule on this motion.

1167
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,270
我讨厌输
I hate losing.

1168
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,740
你已经尽力了
It was a good effort.

1169
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,170
这个结果会影响集体诉讼吗
Does this impact the class?

1170
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,810
很遗憾  会的
Yes, unfortunately.

1171
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,720
诉讼资助退出了
The litigation financiers dropped out.

1172
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,730
我以为他说的是实话
I thought he was telling the truth.

1173
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,890
或许吧
Well, maybe he was.

1174
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,260
跑步鞋那部分估计是真的
About the running shoes.

1175
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,030
知道吗  人是可以撒谎的同时说真话的
You know, people can lie and still be telling the truth.

1176
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,540
没有人是非黑即白
Nobody's a hundred percent of any one thing.

1177
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,140
我妈妈癌症的事情就说谎了
My mom lied about her cancer.

1178
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,110
只是有担心而已
It was a scare.

1179
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,310
但不是真复发
It wasn't real.

1180
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,460
她不过是想见我
She just wanted to see me.

1181
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,600
她寂寞了
She's lonely.

1182
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,500
人寂寞时总会不顾一切
People get desperate when they're lonely.

1183
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,280
你应该去看看她
You should go see her.

1184
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:08,150
妈妈
Mom?

1185
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,340
妈妈
Mom?

1186
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,260
玛娅  你来干什么
Maia, what are you doing?

1187
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,290
我想看看你怎么样
I wanted to see how you were.

1188
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,550
好
Good.

1189
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:25,830
我就要睡了
I was just going to bed.

1190
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,760
怎么了
What's wrong?

1191
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,700
明天一起吃早餐吧
Why don't we have breakfast tomorrow?

1192
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,650
外面是谁的车
Whose car is that outside?

1193
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,130
昨天有粉刷工过来  他们有一辆车没开走
Just the painters were here yesterday. They left one.

1194
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,460
茶呢  丽诺
Where's the tea, Lenore?

1195
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,090
这不是个好时机
It's not a good time.

1196
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,030
你好  贾克斯叔叔
Hi, Uncle Jax.
