1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,230
《訴訟雙雄》前情提要

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,430
我這么早起床  是為了考慮
I got up early, so I could figure out

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,090
這里有沒有哪樣家具我能接著用
if there's anything around here that I could stand living with.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,890
-你要搬過來一起住嗎  -如果你還邀請我的話
- You want to move in together? - If the offer still stands.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,590
開玩笑嗎
Are you kidding me?

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,600
奎汀跟我還是夫妻時  你就跟他上床了
You slept with Quentin while he was married to me.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,210
我那時問你
I asked you back then

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,110
我們分開前  你們是不是就有一腿了
if anything had started before we were separated.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,180
你說沒有
You said it hadn't.

10
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,710
那是因為我不想傷害你
'Cause I didn't want to hurt you.

11
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,680
敬嶄新的合伙關系
Here's to your new partnership.

12
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,760
我替你付了買入股份款
I fronted your buy-in.

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,970
你怎么能這么做
How could you do that?

14
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,500
我把它當作浪漫之舉
I did it as a romantic gesture.

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,350
是啊  美女或許愛演浪漫電影
Yeah, well, pretty woman may have been a romantic movie,

16
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,780
但朱莉亞·羅伯茨還是個妓女
But Julia Roberts was still a hooker.

17
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,640
你知道奎汀有肌萎縮側索硬化癥多久了
How long have you known Quentin had A.L.S.?

18
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,480
一開始就知道
From the beginning.

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,660
那你知道他為了自救  在實驗結果上造假
And how long have you known Quentin falsified

20
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,840
好讓藥早點上市這件事多久了
trial results to get the drug on the market?

21
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,440
-他沒撒謊  -但你撒謊了
- He didn't lie. - But you did.

22
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,790
而我愛他  我還能怎么做
I love him. So what else could I do?

23
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,730
我是認真的  斯科特
I am in this, Scottie.

24
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,720
好的
Okay.

25
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,430
我也是
So am I.

26
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,150
認為邁克·羅斯上的是一所很差的法學院
I think Mike Ross went to a subpar law school

27
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,610
而且一直在用謊言掩蓋這個事實
and has been lying about it the whole time.

28
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,040
給哈佛打電話要一份他的成績單復印件
Just call up Harvard and ask for a copy of his transcript.

29
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,850
吉拉德教授的法律職業道德課
Professor Gerard's legal ethics class,

30
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,730
你聽說過誰得了"A+"嗎
did you ever hear of anybody ever getting an a-plus?

31
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,430
沒有  他就是以給分不超過"A"出名的
No, he's famous for never giving higher than an "A."

32
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,600
法律職業道德  吉拉德教授

33
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,140
你為什么這么開心啊
Well, what are you so happy about?

34
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,920
今早上你沖澡時我用泡沫布做了拖鞋
I made bubble-wrap slippers this morning while you were in the shower.

35
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,080
我還特地告訴過你  泡沫布是用來包盤子的
I specifically told you the bubble wrap is for the dishes.

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,450
我還做了頂帽子
I also made a hat.

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,020
好吧  我要跟個十歲小孩同居了
Okay, I'm moving in with a ten-year-old.

38
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,270
你愛我的
And you love me.

39
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,600
是啊
I do.

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,100
我在想
Hey, I was thinking,

41
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,870
我們的床要怎么辦啊
what are we going to do about our bed?

42
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,460
我們已經有兩張床了
We already have two.

43
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,450
是啊
I know, but, yeah, we do.

44
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,190
但你不覺得新的開始該買新的床嗎
But don't you think a new beginning deserves a new bed?

45
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,990
這真是太可愛了
That...is incredibly sweet.

46
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,080
十歲小孩能想到真不賴哈
Yeah, not bad for a ten-year-old, huh?

47
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,550
你想要什么樣的床
What kind of bed were you thinking?

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,770
我們今晚試過之后挑一個唄
Whichever one we pick out after we test them tonight.

49
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,710
你想好了什么特定的測試嗎
And did you have any particular test in mind?

50
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,410
現在有了
Well, now I do.

51
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,650
不過店家估計不會允許我們那么測試吧
See, I don't think the store is gonna let us run that kind of test.

52
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,550
是啊  有道理
Yeah. No, you're right.

53
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,240
我們今晚出去之前在家測試一下吧
We should probably just test ours before we go out tonight.

54
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,270
你干什么啊
What are you doing?

55
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,430
路易剛剛可能看到我們了
I think that Louis might have just seen us.

56
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,730
那又怎么樣啊
Come on, what's the difference?

57
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,770
我們要同居了
We're moving in together.

58
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,650
我們是不是別再保密了
I think it's time we stopped keeping it a secret.

59
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,900
但是保密還挺好玩的嘛
But keeping it a secret is sort of fun.

60
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,470
還性感
And sexy.

61
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,190
我是最贊成性感的了  我可是做了
And I am pro sexy-I mean, I did make

62
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,150
泡沫布拖鞋和帽子呢
those bubble-wrap slippers and hat after all,

63
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,000
說來好笑
which is funny, 'cause...

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,990
因為那不叫性感  只是好玩
that's not sexy, it's just fun.

65
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,750
-算是吧  -算是
- It's something. - Something.

66
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,690
我還給你做了
I made you some too.

67
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,180
達娜·斯科特  資深合伙人

68
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,540
哈維  她至少還要一周才會回來呢
Hey, Harvey, she won't be back for another week,

69
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,400
你現在還是先別開瓶了
so I don't think you need to start drinking just yet.

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,630
你是要取笑我  還是幫我想想
You want to make fun, or you want to help me

71
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,000
這東西該放哪
figure out where to put this?

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,770
威士忌酒
A bottle of scotch?

73
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,740
你就不能給她買點更貼心的禮物嗎
You couldn't get her anything more personal?

74
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,070
-她喜歡威士忌  -那是你
- She likes scotch. - You like scotch.

75
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,500
她喜歡我  因此
She likes me. Therefore...

76
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,040
你何不附上張卡片
Why don't you just attach a card that says,

77
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,840
寫上"歡迎  隨便你是誰  資深合伙人"
"Welcome, generic senior partner"?

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,720
這可是一萬二的威士忌
This is a $12,000 bottle of scotch,

79
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,460
而且是全球僅有的三瓶之一
and this is one of three left in the world.

80
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,230
這怎么能算是"隨便"呢  這表示...
That doesn't say generic, that says--

81
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,640
你是我最近買下的三樣
You're one of three very expensive things

82
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,850
貴重物品之一
I recently purchased.

83
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,290
入股的事我們談開了
We worked it out about the buy-in.

84
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,010
那這只會揭開瘡疤
And this is gonna un-work it out.

85
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,180
說來好笑
You know, it's funny.

86
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,360
先說這不夠貼心  現在又變成有特殊意義了
First it was too generic. Now it's special.

87
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,240
你什么意思
What are you saying?

88
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,490
你覺得你不是不滿意我選擇的禮品
I don't think you have a problem with my choice of gift.

89
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,100
我覺得你是對接受禮物的人有意見
I think you have a problem with my choice of recipient.

90
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,000
如果不是我  你覺得斯科特能來這兒嗎
Do you think scottie would even be here if it wasn't for me?

91
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,580
是不能
No, I don't.

92
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,640
哈維  我希望你能如愿
Harvey, I want this for you.

93
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,850
我也希望你們能好好的  我只是想
I want it to work, and I'm just trying to--

94
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,570
確保我不搞砸了
Make sure I don't screw it up.

95
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,300
我們都知道那是早晚的事
Well, we both know you're gonna screw it up.

96
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,190
我只是想讓那天盡量晚點來
I'm just trying to delay that as long as possible.

97
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,000
你確定嗎
You sure about this?

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,940
那瓶酒就是我秘書日時自己買禮物的原因
That bottle is the reason I buy my own present for secretary's day.

99
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,910
-還有秘書日呢  -有啊
- There's a secretary's day? - There is.

100
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,440
而且你可慷慨了
And you're very generous.

101
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,110
你好嗎  邁克
How you doing, Mike?

102
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,340
激動嗎
Are you excited or what?

103
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,750
激動什么
Excited about what?

104
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,460
沒收到我的電郵嗎
Didn't you get my email?

105
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,300
收到了
Oh, there it is.

106
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,400
讀讀吧
Why don't you read it?

107
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,500
算了
Oh, actually, you know what, never mind.

108
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,380
我就直接告訴你吧
I'll just let you know what it says.

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,400
很棒的  你一定喜歡
It's so great. You're gonna love it.

110
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,120
我請了亨利·吉拉德周五過來
It says I invited Henry Gerard here

111
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,130
做講座
to give a lecture this Friday.

112
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,060
好啊
That's great.

113
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,220
你根本不知道那是誰吧
You don't even know who he is, do you?

114
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,170
亨利·吉拉德教授嘛
Professor Henry Gerard,

115
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,910
法律道德課教材的作者
author of the definitive text in legal ethics

116
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,420
在該部門任了20年的主席
and chair of the department for the last 20 years.

117
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,910
我當然知道他
Yeah, I know who he is.

118
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,080
那你還記得你在他班上拿的分數嗎
And do you also remember what you got in his class?

119
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,790
A+不容易忘啊
It's pretty hard to forget an a-plus.

120
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,460
是啊  忘記不可能的分數的確不容易
Yeah, it's pretty hard to forget a grade that never happened.

121
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,870
吉拉德從不給人A+
No one gets an a-plus in Gerard's class.

122
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,240
也沒人能背下他書里的一整章
Yeah, well, no one can recite an entire chapter of his book from memory.

123
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,650
-除了我  我做到了  -胡說
- But I can and did. - Bullsh--.

124
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,360
你沒拿到A+  因為你從沒上過那門課
You never got an a-plus because you never took his class.

125
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,540
那是必修課  路易  我當然修了
It's a required class, Louis. Of course I took it.

126
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,870
除非你就沒去過哈佛
Not if you never went to Harvard.

127
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,740
路易  別傻了
Louis, that is insane.

128
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,210
我有哈佛的成績單
I have a transcript from Harvard.

129
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,800
我有哈佛的學位  因為
I have a degree from Harvard. That's because I--

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,900
慢著  我猜猜  因為你去過哈佛嗎
Wait, let me guess. 'cause you went to Harvard?

131
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,890
你瞧  邁克  問題是
See, Mike, here's the situation.

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,340
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

133
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,050
我也不想給吉拉德打電話問他
And I don't want to call Gerard up and ask him

134
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,690
因為我不想讓我的公司被世人嘲笑
'cause I don't want the world laughing at my firm.

135
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,000
但如果周五的時候  他沒有走過來
But if he doesn't walk up to you on Friday

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,170
對你說  邁克·羅斯  我的得意門生
and say, "Mike Ross, my beloved student

137
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,120
我記得你  你是唯一
who I remember, because he's the only one

138
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,640
我給了A+的學生
I ever gave an a-plus to,"

139
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,460
那我就知道你是在撒謊了
Well, then, I'm gonna know you're lying.

140
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,570
如果你還不肯承認
And if you still don't come clean,

141
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,580
那我就啟動正式調查
I'm gonna launch a formal investigation,

142
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,390
不管那會不會讓事務所難堪
whether it makes my firm look bad or not.

143
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,960
別發瘋了  沒什么可調查的
This is crazy. There is nothing to investigate.

144
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,640
那我寧可像個瘋子一樣揪出冒牌貨
Well, I'd rather risk looking crazy to root out an impostor

145
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,650
也不能冒險讓那個冒牌貨毀了我在乎的一切
than to risk letting that impostor poison everything that I stand for.

146
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,280
結束了  邁克
It's over, Mike.

147
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,870
我盯上你了
I'm on to you,

148
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,260
我要揭露你
and I'm gonna expose you

149
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,100
撒謊卑賤的真面目
for the lying piece of filth that you are.

150
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,290
你吐完了
Don't forget to rinse your mouth out

151
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,830
別忘記漱口
after you're done throwing up.

你以前說過  如果路易知情了  我們會知道
Do you remember when you said if Louis knew, we'd know?

166
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,970
他知道了
He knows.

167
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,160
他做了什么
What did he do?

168
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,840
時間軸  小式

169
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,320
他要請亨利·吉拉德來做講座
He's bringing in Henry Gerard to give a lecture.

170
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,080
那又怎樣
So what?

171
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,140
這會是你第一次受他講座的摧殘
It'll only be the first time you've had to suffer through it.

時間軸  憑陵新月

173
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,260
他帶他來是因為他看到
He's bringing him in because he saw

174
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,050
我在他課上拿過A+
I got an A-plus in his class.

175
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,440
什么  沒人能在吉拉德課上拿到A+
What? No one gets an A-plus in Gerard's class.

176
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,690
后期  冰冰愛尖尖

177
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,800
-這就是問題所在  -該死的
- Welcome to the problem. - God damn it.

178
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,280
唐娜  進來
Donna, get in here.

179
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,250
你叫唐娜干什么
Why are you calling Donna?

180
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,320
因為是她發現路易已經知道
Because she's the one who found out that Louis knows

181
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,210
哈佛大學檔案庫里沒有你
you don't have a file in the Harvard file room.

182
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,610
總監  swears

183
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,020
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

184
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,330
因為路易的新女朋友
Because Louis's new girlfriend

185
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,410
是管哈佛大學檔案庫的
is the queen of that file room,

186
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,910
而且她還把他留在了那里
and she left him alone in there.

187
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,760
你們怎么沒跟我說一下呢
You guys didn't think to mention this?

188
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,950
我以為我處理好了
I thought I handled it.

189
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,150
她確實處理了
She did handle it.

190
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,950
她讓他去查看你的成績單
She sent him to sniff out your transcript.

191
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,520
結果沒想到法律倫理學課
Only she didn't realize you gave yourself

192
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,700
你居然給自己打了A+
an A-plus in legal ethics.

193
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,760
不是我打的  是羅拉·詹森打的
I didn't give it to myself. Lola Jensen did.

194
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,340
誰給你打的分并不重要
I don't give a shit who gave it to you,

195
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,560
問題在于分數不是吉拉德教授打的
unless it was professor Gerard, which it wasn't.

196
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,830
修這門課的人有多少
How many people take the class?

197
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,930
也許  邁克可以混跡在人群中
I mean, maybe Mike will just be another face in the crowd.

198
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,820
路易請他過來
Louis is bringing him here

199
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,180
是為了看他是否認得自己的得意門生
to see if he embraces his star student.

200
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,780
混跡在人群中完全是個餿主意
The worst thing I can do is just be another face in the crowd.

201
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,810
一定要確保他來不了
We need to make it so that he doesn't come.

202
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,950
不行
It's not gonna happen.

203
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,290
他從來不會取消約定
The man doesn't back out of commitments.

204
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,740
他最喜歡的名言是"法律的運轉
His favorite quote is "For the law to work,

205
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,910
離不開人的言行如一"
there must be honor in one's word."

206
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,630
-這是誰的名言  -他自己的
- Who's he quoting? - Himself.

207
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,710
自戀狂
Pompous prick.

208
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,430
他根本沒參與過實戰
Guy never practiced a day in his life,

209
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,560
就敢寫法律社會倫理學方面的書
thinks he can write the book on real-world ethics.

210
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,490
好吧
Okay.

211
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,460
我不恐慌  但是我們該怎么辦
I'm not panicking, but what are we gonna do?

212
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,810
你暫時先靜觀其變
Right now, you're gonna sit tight.

213
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,150
那你們怎么做
And what are you going to do?

214
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,200
我覺得應該告訴杰西卡
I think it's time to tell Jessica.

215
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,450
我們得談談
We need to talk.

216
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,220
-確實  -你知道了嗎
- We do. - You know?

217
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,880
不知道  但不管是什么  先等等
No, but whatever it is, it can wait.

218
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,570
這個事情等不了
This isn't something that can wait.

219
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,890
奎汀去世了
Quentin died.

220
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,460
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.

221
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,980
我知道肌萎縮側索硬化癥不容樂觀
I knew A.L.S. wasn't gonna be a picnic.

222
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,330
我也知道總有這么一天  但是...
And I knew this was coming, but it doesn't--

223
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,200
如果你需要一段時間調整  我可以照顧這里
Look, if you need some time, I can manage things here.

224
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,370
哈維  我很想休息
The truth is, Harvey, I'd take it.

225
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,720
但麗薩正在路上
but Lisa's on her way in

226
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,550
要跟我們討論奎汀的遺囑
to discuss Quentin's will with us.

227
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,980
我們
Us?

228
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,120
奎汀讓我們來擔任他財產的遺囑執行人
Quentin named you and I co-executors of his estate.

229
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,760
你是她丈夫的前妻
You're her husband's ex-wife.

230
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,590
我覺得麗薩不會把這件事當成公事
I doubt Lisa sees this as just business.

231
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,300
肯定不會
No, I can't imagine she does.

232
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,400
你能把這件事完全當公事嗎
Can you see this as just business?

233
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,490
你不喜歡她
You don't like her,

234
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,830
也不信任她  而且這非常理所當然
you don't trust her, and you have good reason for both.

235
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,310
奎汀要求我這樣做
Quentin asked me to do this.

236
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,300
也許他讓我也當遺囑執行人是有原因的
Maybe he gave you a co-executor for a reason.

237
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,830
你是說他在給我機會退出嗎
You're saying he was giving me an out?

238
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,620
不  我只是說我會陪著你
No, I'm just saying that I'm here,

239
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,250
所以你不用勉強自己
and you don't have to do this.

240
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,940
哈維  他給了我責任
Harvey, he asked me,

241
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,110
我不會讓他失望
and I'm not going to let him down.

242
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,960
邁克  你不能坐以待斃
Mike, you can't just wait for the ax to fall.

243
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,570
我沒有坐以待斃  我做了準備
I didn't just wait. I armed myself.

244
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,610
充分了解了吉拉德和他的課程信息
I learned everything there is to know about Gerard and his class.

245
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,820
哈維說得對  這貨真是自戀狂
Harvey is right. This guy is a prick.

246
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,220
他讓所有學生必須讀他的書
He makes everybody read his books

247
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,370
但根本不會考里面的內容
and then doesn't even test on them.

248
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,730
好吧  但是這種準備不夠
Okay, but arming yourself isn't enough.

249
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,020
我們得做點別的
We need to actually do something.

250
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,690
哈維讓我靜觀其變
Harvey told me to sit tight.

251
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,250
所以我就靜觀其變
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

252
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,260
是嗎  可那是因為哈維并不危險
Right, that's because Harvey's life isn't on the line.

253
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,830
我們很危險
Ours is.

254
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,420
我們
Ours?

255
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,440
邁克  我選擇跟你同居
Mike, I am not moving in with you

256
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,660
不是因為我要找新住處
because I need a new place to live.

257
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,680
好吧  那我們應該怎么辦
Okay, so what do you think we should do?

258
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,190
怎樣才能讓他相信你上過哈佛大學
What's gonna make him believe that you went to Harvard?

259
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,780
我的成績單  畢業證書
Well, if my transcript, diploma,

260
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,800
還有一份只有哈佛畢業生能拿到的工作
and the job you can only get by having attended Harvard

261
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,730
這樣都不夠的話  我也不知道了
aren't enough, I'm not really sure what is.

262
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,460
肯定有點什么話可以說吧
Well, there's got to be something you can say.

263
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,440
瑞秋  你也知道路易這人
Look, Rachel, you know Louis.

264
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,500
我越努力否認
The more I try and deny it,

265
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,120
他就越會追根究底
the more he's gonna come after me.

266
00:10:34,450 --> 00:11:34,450
人人影視
YYeTs.com

267
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,080
真是難以置信
I can't believe this.

268
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,070
他這人就這樣
He is not gonna be happy

269
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,590
一定要證明自己是對的才滿意
until he has a signed full confession proving he was right.

270
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,210
沒錯
You're right.

271
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,590
那我就讓他滿意
And that's exactly what I'm gonna give him.

272
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,450
來吧
Come on.

273
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,180
你還真是直截了當
It's all fairly straightforward.

274
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,850
公司不應該受影響
The company shouldn't be affected.

275
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,170
這份遺囑進行法律認證事
Tim can continue with the day-to-day

276
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,520
蒂姆可以繼續過日常生活
while this works its way through probate.

277
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,090
可是日常生活會發生變化
Well, the day-to-day's going to change.

278
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,610
-為什么  -普萊森提出了一個交易
- How so? - We have an offer from Pryzen.

279
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,000
你想賣掉公司嗎
You want to sell the company?

280
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,800
我想接受這個交易
I want to accept an offer.

281
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,760
你動作真快
Well, that was fast.

282
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,810
你說什么
Excuse me?

283
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,610
杰西卡的意思是
What Jessica is saying is

284
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,800
普萊森還真是見縫插針
Pryzen didn't waste any time swooping in.

285
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,490
不  我的意思是
No, what I'm saying is,

286
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,030
再進行法律認證之前
before we authorize anything,

287
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,240
得先確定這樣是否有好處
we need to evaluate if this is even a good idea.

288
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,460
沒必要
I don't see why.

289
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,130
我們的法律顧問認為這樣可以  我同意
Our general counsel thinks it's a good idea, and I agree.

290
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,920
而且公司的股份大部分由我繼承
And I'm the one who's inheriting the majority of the company,

291
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,440
-所以我有權決定  -不  并不是這樣
- so it's my decision. - Actually, it isn't.

292
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,600
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

293
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,940
我的工作是確保奎汀能夠得償所愿
My job is to see that Quentin's wishes are fulfilled.

294
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,480
你是在暗示  你比我更了解他的遺愿嗎
Are you implying that you know his wishes better than I do?

295
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,110
我是在暗示  他去世不到一周
I'm implying he's not dead a week,

296
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,710
你就要把他的名字從公司除掉  永不提起
and you want to strip his name off the door and into oblivion.

297
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,690
我是要讓他窮極一生
What I want to do is put the drug

298
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,280
研發出的藥品
that he dedicated his life to

299
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,440
交給有資源去完成的公司手里
in the hands of a company with the resources to finish it.

300
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,800
當他為這樣的公司工作時
And I was there

301
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,680
我還在他身邊
when he worked for companies like this.

302
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,750
而他討厭這些公司
And he hated them,

303
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,910
這也是后來他出去自己干的原因
which is why he went out on his own.

304
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,010
你在他身邊
You were there?

305
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,900
我聽說的可不是這樣
Well, that's not how I heard the story.

306
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,730
行了  我們不是來吵架的
All right, we're not doing this.

307
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,880
你想要賣掉你的股份嗎
You want to sell your shares?

308
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,980
沒人說你不可以
No one's saying you can't.

309
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,740
但我們有責任對它進行評估
But we have a responsibility to evaluate it.

310
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,840
還記得你說過你會試著和解的
Remember when you said you'd try to be conciliatory?

311
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,150
我從沒說過那句話
I never said that.

312
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,130
你應該這么說的
Well, you should have,

313
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,080
因為你絕對沒辦法不帶私人感情色彩
'cause you sure couldn't keep the personal out of it.

314
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,200
我不覺得他們會伙同所有員工
I didn't think they were gonna come at me

315
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,260
一起逼我
with all that stuff.

316
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,340
他們沒要逼你
They weren't coming at you.

317
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,190
他們只是帶來了一個提議
They were coming with a proposal.

318
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,350
你真的覺得那個提議是憑空而來的嗎
Do you really think that offer came out of thin air?

319
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,500
我覺得他們有可能是等著攻其不備
I think it's possible they waited to pounce.

320
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,630
也有可能是
It's also possible

321
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,630
在奎汀還躺在病床上時
that Lisa and Tim put this in motion

322
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,890
麗莎和蒂姆就開始找買家了
while Quentin was lying in his hospital bed.

323
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,810
那假如真是這樣呢
And what if they did?

324
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,530
這是我們該管的事嗎
Is that really our business?

325
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,510
杰西卡  我知道這對你而言有多困難
Jessica, I understand how hard this is for you,

326
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,690
但這個藥才是他的心血遺作
but his legacy is this drug.

327
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,310
而不在于是制成此藥是否在他名下
It's not about whose name is on the company that makes it.

328
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,770
你是說你贊同麗莎嗎
You're saying you agree with Lisa.

329
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,630
我現在說的正是我之前試圖告訴你的
I'm saying to you now what I tried to tell you before.

330
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,390
你肯定會帶私人感情色彩  而我不會
This is personal for you. It's not personal for me.

331
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,550
所以在我們有進一步行動之前
So before we take another step,

332
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,670
讓我先評估一下這個提議吧
let me evaluate this offer.

333
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,500
你說的沒錯
You're right.

334
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,200
我騙了你
I lied to you.

335
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,050
我騙了所有人
I lied to everyone.

336
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,920
我是作弊才進了這里
I cheated to get here,

337
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,450
假如你把我推到亨利·吉拉德面前
and if you put me in front of Henry Gerard,

338
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,830
他是不會記得我的
he's not gonna remember me.

339
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,860
因為你從來沒上過他的課
'Cause you never took his class.

340
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,070
因為我從來沒去上過他課
Because I never went to his class.

341
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,300
因為你從來沒上過哈佛
'Cause you never went to Harvard.

342
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,370
-不是這樣的  -放屁
- That's not true. - Bullshit.

343
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,010
路易  拜托  聽著
Louis, please, look,

344
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,480
我知道你完全有權利生我的氣
I know you have every right to be angry with me.

345
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,880
我沒生氣
I'm not angry.

346
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,790
氣憤只是一閃而過
Angry is just a flash in the pan.

347
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,300
但我對你的痛恨卻是綿綿無絕期的
My outrage is here to stay,

348
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,680
而我會消滅一切威脅我律所的毒瘤
and I will obliterate any infection threatening my firm.

349
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,480
我不是你認為的毒瘤
I'm not the infection you think I am.

350
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,380
唯一造了假的就是那個A+
The only thing that's bullshit is that A-plus!

351
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,990
你說什么
What?

352
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,080
路易  我上過哈佛的  我...
Louis, I went to Harvard. I...

353
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,040
我只是改了我的成績
I just changed my grade.

354
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,490
你覺得我會相信你這套說辭嗎
You expect me to believe that?

355
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,120
我一直是我上過的每所學校里
I have always been the smartest kid

356
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,030
最聰明的學生
at every school that I went to.

357
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,210
高中  大學  在哈佛的前兩年
High school, college, the first two years of Harvard,

358
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,020
我不用學都能拿A
I'd get "A"s without studying.

359
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,770
我不去上課都能在所有考試里拿滿分  但是...
I'd ace every test without going to class, but--

360
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,620
但是到了第三年
but that third year...

361
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,020
你得上吉拉德的課
You had to take Gerard.

362
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,100
我能背下他的書
I could memorize his books,

363
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,340
但是他的考試卻和他的書無關
but his tests weren't about his books.

364
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,850
是啊  他的考試是和他的講座有關
Yeah, they're about his lectures.

365
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,070
-期末考試...  -我掛了
- The final exam-- - I failed it.

366
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,090
我去他辦公室求他再給我一次機會
I went to his office to beg for a second chance.

367
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,910
他從來不會再給一次機會
He doesn't give second chances.

368
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,210
但我總得試試看啊
I had to try.

369
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,390
他不會答應的
He wouldn't do it.

370
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,680
他不在辦公室
He wasn't there.

371
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,610
我進了他辦公室  里面沒有人
I got to his office. It was empty.

372
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,100
他的電腦就開在那里
His computer was just sitting there,

373
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,630
登在主系統上
logged in to the main system.

374
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,070
他正準備把成績提交上去
He was about to submit his grades.

375
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,570
在他回來前我只有幾秒鐘的時間  所以
I only had a few seconds before he came back, so...

376
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,970
我決定自救一下
I decided to save myself.

377
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,870
不對  你是決定給自己一個A+
No, you decided to give yourself an A-plus.

378
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,500
不是的  路易
No, Louis.

379
00:14:34,450 --> 00:15:34,450
人人影視
YYeTs.com

380
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,000
也許你以后再也沒辦法相信我了
You might not be able to believe me about anything else ever again.

381
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,400
但你得相信這個
Believe this.

382
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,910
你無法想象我是有多希望能重來一遍
You have no idea how much I wish I could do it over again,

383
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,610
若能重來  我會正正當當
because this time, I would do it right.

384
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,620
我會去上每一堂課  去聽每一個講座
I would go to every class, and I would attend every lecture,

385
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,890
我會盡力汲取哈佛所提供的一切
and I would feast on what that place has to offer

386
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,510
比所有人都認真
like no one ever has.

387
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,060
但是你第一次就沒做好
But you didn't do it right the first time.

388
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,690
你作弊了
You cheated,

389
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,470
而如今你又指望我幫你逃過一劫
and now you're looking at me to help you get away with it.

390
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,000
不是的  路易
No, Louis--

391
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,430
滾出我的視線
Get out of my sight.

392
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,470
真是驚喜啊
What a surprise.

393
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,520
路易  拜托了  我只是想...
Louis, please, I just want to--

394
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,180
我知道你想干什么  你想要說服我
I know what you want to do-- you want to lobby me

395
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,080
為了某個膽大包天的人
on behalf of someone who had the audacity--

396
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,200
我愛他
I love him.

397
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,810
什么
What?

398
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,970
我們準備同居了
We're moving in together,

399
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,840
我們準備一起開始一段生活
and we're starting a life together.

400
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,410
瑞秋
Rachel--

401
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,330
而我之所以告訴你這個
And I'm telling you this

402
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,460
是因為我知道他干了什么
because I know what he did

403
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,930
但我仍然愛著他
And I still love him.

404
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,410
好吧  問題來了
Okay, here's the problem.

405
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,890
我不愛他
I don't.

406
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,760
-路易  -瑞秋...
- Louis. - Rachel...

407
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,540
我尊敬你
I respect you.

408
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,840
我關心你
I care about you.

409
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,040
但這不是針對你
But this isn't about you.

410
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,500
這是針對邁克和他對我做的事
This is about Mike and what he did to me.

411
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,760
你知道嗎
You know,

412
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,290
你叫他做你助手的那個晚上  他來找我了
he came to me the night that you asked him to be your associate.

413
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,160
我要他跟著你干
I told him to go with you.

414
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,160
為什么
Why?

415
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,670
因為他說過他和你有一種聯系
Because he said he had a connection with you

416
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,230
那種聯系他從沒和哈維有過的
that he's never had with Harvey.

417
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,700
-他這么說過  -是的
- He said that? - Yes.

418
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,780
你們對法律有著共同的熱愛
Your shared love of the law.

419
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,500
-是的  這是我告訴他的  -我知道
- Yeah, I told him that. - I know.

420
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,810
而我和你也有同樣的聯系
And I have the same connection with you.

421
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,860
瑞秋  你是想叫我去...
Rachel, you're asking me to--

422
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,960
路易  他做這件事不是針對你
Louis, he didn't do this to you.

423
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,470
他這么做是為了能從事
He did it so that he can practice the thing

424
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,170
我們都熱愛的事業
that we all love.

425
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,920
假如你不放過他的話
And if you don't let it go,

426
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,870
他就再也不能從事這個了
he's never gonna be able to practice it again.

427
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,880
謝謝你獨自前來
Thank you for coming alone.

428
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,980
我很高興能幫上忙
I'm happy to help,

429
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,600
但我和杰西卡是一邊的
but Jessica and I are a team,

430
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,210
而你單獨見我并不能改變這一點
and asking to see me alone doesn't change that.

431
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,150
在這過程中我不會撇開她
I'm not gonna cut her out of the process.

432
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,330
這難道不是她想對我做的事嗎
Isn't that what she's doing to me?

433
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,890
她試圖取消交易
She's trying to kill the sale.

434
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,090
這封信上可不是這么說的
That's not what this letter says.

435
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,520
我不是律師  但我也不蠢
I'm not a lawyer, but I'm not stupid.

436
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,520
上面說一切接洽都必須經過皮爾遜-斯佩克特
It says all communication goes through Pearson Specter.

437
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,600
這個不會影響交易的
This doesn't kill the deal.

438
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,680
但這會告訴他們
It tells them that

439
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,030
他們一直在和沒有實權的人協商
they've been negotiating with people with no power at all.

440
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,100
不  這會告訴他們  他們必須得
No, it tells them they have to

441
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,290
在進行雙向談判而非單向
negotiate with two entities instead of just one.

442
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,230
這能使我們更占上風
It gives us more firepower.

443
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,460
你想怎么樣  麗莎
What do you want, Lisa?

444
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,670
我想知道你為什么沒有在上面簽名
I want to know why your signature isn't on that letter.

445
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,130
因為我們達成一致了
Because we came to a consensus,

446
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,050
她代表我們簽了名
and she signed it on both our behalves.

447
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,760
-我不相信你  -隨便你
- I don't believe you. - I don't care.

448
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,890
如果你不能接受我們通知買家
And if you can't handle us notifying the buyer

449
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,400
說正在評估這筆交易
that we're evaluating this sale,

450
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,390
那我就該質疑
then it makes me question

451
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,900
到底是誰被蒙蔽了
whose judgment is really clouded.

452
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,450
恕我失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse me,

453
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,820
背著我的合伙人來見你  我已經見夠了
I'm done meeting behind my partner's back.

454
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,480
不是說好讓我評估這筆交易嗎
What the hell happened to letting me evaluate this offer?

455
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,290
我讓你來評估
I am letting you evaluate the offer.

456
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,320
你想用這封信把交易攪黃了
You sent this letter to kill the deal.

457
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,640
我是想用那封信幫你拖延時間
I sent that letter to buy you time.

458
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,240
杰西卡  你以我的名義簽了一份
Jessica, you put my name on a document

459
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,020
你明知我絕不會同意的文件
you knew I wouldn't support.

460
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,080
你站在麗莎那邊了  你想賣
You are on lisa's side. You want to sell.

461
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,640
這與麗莎無關  我壓根就不在乎
This isn't about lisa, and I don't give a shit

462
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,450
這間公司到底賣不賣
whether this company is sold or not.

463
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,380
但這關乎你我的關系
This is about you and me

464
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,760
還有我們經營事務所的方式
and how we're going to run this firm.

465
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,520
我們不是談過這點了嗎
Didn't we just have a conversation about that?

466
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,530
是啊  談過了
Yeah, we sure did.

467
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,800
牽扯到斯科特的時候
And when it had to do with Scottie,

468
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,750
你洋洋灑灑地說了一通信任
you gave me a big speech about trust,

469
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,750
說我得相信你所做的一切
about how I had to trust you had rational reasons

470
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,730
都有合理的理由
for what you were doing.

471
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,760
-這是兩回事  -沒錯
- This is different. - Exactly.

472
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,660
這次不是我的私事
This time it's not personal for me.

473
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,740
而是你的
It's personal for you.

474
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,180
而且你違反了自己定下的規矩
And you're not playing by your own rules.

475
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,140
這筆交易是個錯誤  哈維
This deal is wrong, Harvey.

476
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,570
而且無論如何  我還是執行合伙人
And like it or not, I'm still the managing partner.

477
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,590
在這個案子上并不是
Not on this.

478
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,490
你只是共同執行人
On this, you're a co-executor,

479
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,350
別再用以我的名義簽署任何文件
and you're not putting my name on any more letters.

480
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,250
我建議你收拾好心情
So I suggest you get your head on straight

481
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,690
理性地看待這筆交易
and look at this deal rationally.

482
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,060
如果你做不到
And if you can't do that,

483
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,950
我建議你別再插手了
I suggest you step aside.

484
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,850
杰西卡  你愛過他
Jessica, you loved him.

485
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,640
我知道你很痛苦  她也是
I know you're hurting. So is she.

486
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,390
不管你過去跟她有什么恩怨
Whatever your history with her,

487
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,550
她也一樣感受得到
so is she.

488
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,880
這么晚還沒下班
You're here late.

489
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,060
助理的生活不就這樣
The life of an associate, right?

490
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,170
是啊  我記得
Ah, yeah, I remember.

491
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,580
我也曾待在這個房間
I used to live in this room,

492
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,280
面對成堆的工作
work piled all around me,

493
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,560
靠咖啡和傳遞文件過日子
surviving on coffee, delivery,

494
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,440
不眠不休
and no sleep.

495
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,540
我一直在想
And the whole time, wondering,

496
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,750
伙計  將來能有輕松的日子嗎
"Man, is it ever gonna get any easier?"

497
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,420
-結果有嗎  -沒有
- Does it? - No.

498
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,590
但你還是喜歡這種生活
But you still love it.

499
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,180
你也是
And so do you.

500
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,270
不然你就該回家陪著愛你的人
Or else you'd be home with the woman who loves you,

501
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,000
而不是在這度過漫漫長夜
not spending your night here.

502
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,330
-你知道了  -她來見過我
- You know. - She came to see me.

503
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,020
我本來覺得不能原諒你
I didn't think I could forgive you.

504
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,740
可她設法…
But then somehow, she...

505
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,660
讓我明白了我可以
made me realize I could.

506
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,230
路易  我真不知如何感謝你
Louis, I don't know how to thank you.

507
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,250
別別別  先別謝我
Oh, no, no, no. Don't thank me yet.

508
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,960
你這么做傷害的并不是我
I'm not the one you did this to.

509
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,970
什么意思
What are you saying?

510
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,900
意思就是你這么做傷害了亨利·吉拉德
I'm saying you did this to Henry Gerard.

511
00:19:34,450 --> 00:20:34,450
人人影視
YYeTs.com

512
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,880
而我無權替他決定是否追究
And it's not my place to let it go for him,

513
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,390
所以你得向他坦誠一切
which is why you're gonna have to come clean to him.

514
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,220
你也說過
You said it yourself

515
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,850
吉拉德不會給人第二次機會
Gerard doesn't give second chances.

516
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,470
他給不給機會要由他決定
What he does or doesn't do is up to him.

517
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,690
那是他的權力  邁克
That's his right, Mike,

518
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,020
因為你對不起他
as the person that you wronged.

519
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,110
可他不需要知道我對不起他
Yeah, but he doesn't have to know that I wronged him.

520
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,020
聽我說
Listen to me.

521
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,290
你說過如果有機會重來  你會做對的事
You said that if you had it to do over, you'd do it right.

522
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,480
我正是在給你這樣的機會
I'm giving you that chance.

523
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,980
好好把握
Take it,

524
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,160
否則我只能親自出手了
or I'm gonna have to take it for you.

525
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,830
你來這兒干什么
What are you here to do now,

526
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,650
連我家都要搶嗎
take my house away from me?

527
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,160
我是來找你談談的
I'm here to talk.

528
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,050
上次我們談的時候  你說
Well, the last time we talked, you pretty much said

529
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,040
我不夠關心我丈夫因此沒尊重他的意愿
I don't care about my husband enough to honor his wishes.

530
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,220
上次我們談的時候
The last time we talked,

531
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,600
我犯渾了
I was an asshole.

532
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,740
原諒我蹩腳的法語
Pardon my French.

533
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,640
我不在乎你的法語如何
I don't mind your French.

534
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,810
我后來意識到  或許我
It's come to my attention that I may have let

535
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,020
被之前的恩怨左右了對情勢的判斷
our history affect how I'm handling this situation.

536
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,210
有意思
It's funny.

537
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,640
哈維也讓我意識到了這點
Harvey brought that same thing to my attention.

538
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,660
所以…
So...

539
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,800
告訴我
tell me this.

540
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,140
你為什么想賣
Why do you want to sell?

541
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:09,920
知道我為什么
Do you know why

542
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,210
在肌萎縮性側索硬化試驗的事上撒謊嗎
I lied about those A.L.S. trials?

543
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,430
因為就算鋌而走險我也要繼續這個研究
Because I was desperate for the research to continue.

544
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,930
不過無所謂了
But it didn't matter.

545
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,390
麗莎
Lisa.

546
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,690
他本不該死的
He wasn't supposed to die.

547
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,750
他本來也活不了這么久
He wasn't supposed to live as long as he did.

548
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,510
我們在努力延長他的生命
We weren't trying to prolong his life.

549
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,110
努力研發藥物來治好他
We were trying to find a cure.

550
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,350
可我們沒能做到
And we failed.

551
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,210
你從來沒在乎過錢
You never cared about the money.

552
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,890
我唯一在乎的錢就是為他研發藥物的錢
The only money I cared about is the money to find the cure,

553
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,520
可我們沒有那么多錢    普萊森有
and we don't have the resources. Pryzen does.

554
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,270
但他們已有一種肌萎縮性側索硬化藥了
But they already have an A.L.S. Drug.

555
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,350
那不如我們的有效
It's not as good as ours.

556
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,310
但卻能賺取更多利潤
In profit margin, it's better.

557
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,200
這就意味著沒什么能阻擋他們
Which means there's nothing to stop them

558
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,480
去買你的公司  讓你的藥不見天日
from buying your company, burying your drug,

559
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,460
并以此牟取暴利
and making a fortune.

560
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,800
你想說什么
What are you saying?

561
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,140
我想說你沒有讓他失望
I'm saying you didn't fail him,

562
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,580
但我很清楚那種以為你讓他失望了的感覺
but I know how it feels to think that you did.

563
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,080
有個辦法能確保我們都不會
And I have a way to make sure that neither one of us

564
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,590
再有這樣的感覺
feels that way again.

565
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,330
所以你那偉大的計劃弄巧成拙了
So your great plan backfired.

566
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,600
哈維  對不起
Harvey, I'm sorry.

567
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,130
我不需要你說對不起
I don't need you to say I'm sorry.

568
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,630
但下次我讓你靜觀其變的時候
But the next time I tell you to sit tight,

569
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,260
-你得給我答應  -好
- I need you to say you will. - Okay.

570
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,460
很好  因為我現在
Good, because the next time

571
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,290
就要讓你靜觀其變
I tell you to sit tight is right now.

572
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,580
等等  你打算怎么做
Wait, what are you gonna do?

573
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,070
我要坐飛機去波士頓
I'm getting on a plane to Boston.

574
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,440
去干嘛
And doing what?

575
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,570
等我回來你就知道了
I'll let you know when I get back.

576
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,120
為什么要去波士頓
Why are you going to Boston?

577
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,340
要去見一下馬庫斯  他有了點麻煩
I have to see Marcus. He's in trouble.

578
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,430
我能幫上忙嗎
Anything I can do?

579
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,300
不用  我自己能行
No, I'll handle it myself.

580
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,710
既然你要走  我需要你幫我起草
Since you're leaving, I'm going to need you to draft

581
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,630
一些關于出售桑茲制藥的文件
some language for the Sainz pharmaceutical sale.

582
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,230
所以你同意出售了
So you're in favor of it now?

583
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,370
也不完全是
Well, not exactly.

584
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,960
但我聽了你的話  去見了麗薩
But I heard what you said, and I went to see Lisa.

585
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,220
她和我達成了一致
She and I are on the same page.

586
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,160
你有時間聽聽我們的計劃嗎
Do you have time to hear what the plan is?

587
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
我相信你
I trust you.

588
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,270
你需要我起草什么內容
So what do you need me to draft?

589
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,400
我需要你起草一個
I need you to draft a provision

590
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,410
能保證普萊森完成開發該藥物的條款
that guarantees Pryzen will finish developing that drug.

591
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,310
好的
Consider it done.

592
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,400
他不是去見他弟弟是吧
He's not seeing his brother, is he?

593
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,510
不  不是
No, he's not.

594
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,890
- 想詳細聊一下嗎  -不太想
- Care to elaborate on that? - Not particularly.

595
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,530
你是說我應該相信他嗎
You're saying I should trust him.

596
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,790
我是說我相信
I'm saying I do.

597
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,080
我本想問問你還好嗎  看來我知道答案了
I'd ask how you're holding up, but I can see the answer.

598
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,420
不太好
Not well.

599
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,640
關于你這些天所經歷的事情
I can only imagine what these last couple of days

600
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,960
我只能試圖想象
have been like for you.

601
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,760
但我想跟你說  一切都會好的
But I'm telling you, it's gonna be okay.

602
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
-你怎么知道  -我就是知道
- You don't know that. - Yes, I do.

603
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,570
-如果好不了呢  -那我們就完了
- But what if it's not? - Well, then we're screwed.

604
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,100
但這種情況不會發生的
But that's not gonna happen.

605
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,560
聽著  唐娜
Look, Donna.

606
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,030
我已經很努力的讓自己勇敢了
I am trying so hard to be brave.

607
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,250
但如果路易發現了 邁克所有的秘密呢
But what if Louis ends up finding out everything about Mike?

608
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,420
如果他真的揭發了他  他被抓起來了呢
What if he ends up exposing him and he actually gets arrested?

609
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,770
如果他真的
What if he actually--

610
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
天哪
God.

611
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,700
瑞秋
Rach,

612
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,230
邁克發現我們公司的一個合伙人
Mike found out that one of our partners

613
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,980
下令執行了多起謀殺案
ordered multiple murders.

614
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,780
哈維說他會處理的
Harvey said he'd fix it.

615
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,330
兩天后  那個合伙人就進了監獄
Two days later, that partner was in prison.

616
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,940
史蒂芬是個罪犯  但這件事只是學術上的
Stephen was a criminal. This is an academic.

617
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,370
他沒做什么錯事
He hasn't done anything wrong.

618
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,580
哈維之所以很擅長自己的工作
Well, what makes Harvey great at his job is he knows

619
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,880
就是因為他知道每個人都做了一些錯事
that everybody has done something wrong.

620
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,680
就連國內最受尊重的職業道德教授都一樣嗎
Even the most esteemed ethics professor in the country?

621
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,530
他們看起來越干凈
The cleaner they look,

622
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,600
藏起來的污點就越多
the more dirt they've swept under the rug.

623
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,380
我要說的是  哈維會走過去
I'm telling you, Harvey's gonna walk in there,

624
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,580
然后找到那些污點
he's gonna find the lump,

625
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,390
亨利·吉拉德絕對不會知道他要面對什么
and Henry Gerard is not gonna know what hit him.

626
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,400
每周三晚  八點到十點
Wednesday nights, 8:00 to 10:00,

627
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,610
總是如此準時
it's like clockwork.

628
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,480
一致性并不是什么可怕的東西
Consistency is nothing to be feared.

629
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,180
我沒有害怕  我還指望著它呢
I wasn't afraid of it. I was counting on it.

630
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,310
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter.

631
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,710
吉拉德教授
Professor gerard.

632
00:24:34,450 --> 00:25:34,450
人人影視
YYeTs.com

633
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,560
您還像我當時在這里時一樣
Looks the same as the last time I was here.

634
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,450
對你我就不能這么說了
Can't say you look the same as the last time you were here.

635
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,710
是的  你可以
Yes, you can.

636
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,420
看來你還想以前一樣謙遜
I see you're as humble as ever.

637
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,410
過幾分鐘我們就知道是誰謙遜了
we'll see who's humble in a few minutes.

638
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,810
順便正式說一句
And for the record,

639
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,060
您對我將來會變成什么樣子的判斷是錯的
you were wrong about how I'd turn out.

640
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,640
我知道你變成了什么樣子
I know how you turned out.

641
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,270
紐約最愛和解的律師
More settlements than any other lawyer in New York.

642
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,410
紐約結案效率最高的律師
More closings than any other lawyer in New York.

643
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,510
在現實世界中  和解只是達成目的的
And settling is what it takes to get the job done

644
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,450
一種手段
in the real world.

645
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,620
我知道你所需要的那些手段
I know what it takes for you to do what you do,

646
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,830
這種人生中的妥協讓步
and compromising your way through life

647
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,580
根本不是法律的精神
is no way to go about the law.

648
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,640
看來你還跟以前一樣自大
I see you're as pompous as ever.

649
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,760
你來這里的目的是什么  斯佩克特先生
What did you come here for, Mr. Specter?

650
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,030
-我來請你幫個忙  -我不會答應的
- I came to ask for a favor. - The answer is no.

651
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,110
你還不知道是什么事呢
You don't even know what it is.

652
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,490
但我知道是你在請求我
I know you're the one who's asking.

653
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,780
我就知道你會這么說  所以帶了這個來
I figured you'd say that, which is why I brought this.

654
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,960
我不認為勒索可以叫做幫忙
I don't consider blackmail a favor.

655
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,170
我很懷疑如果董事會看到了這些東西
I doubt the trustees will care about semantics

656
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,040
還會不會在意措辭
when they see that.

657
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,440
我也懷疑董事會有沒有東西可以看
well, I doubt the trustees are gonna see anything at all.

658
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,020
因為那個信封里肯定裝滿了白紙
Because that envelope is full of blank paper

659
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,540
或者你的干洗收據
or your dry cleaning receipts.

660
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,440
你覺得我是在嚇唬你
You think I'm bluffing?

661
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,640
我確定你是
I know you are.

662
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,800
如果你認為信封里面的東西毫無意義
If you think that envelope is meaningless,

663
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
為何不打開看看呢
why don't you go ahead and open it?

664
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,380
你面無表情的功力真是大增
Your poker face has gotten much better,

665
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,370
這點我同意
I'll give you that.

666
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,200
練習得多了  你懂的
A lot of practice, you know,

667
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,260
人生中的妥協讓步
compromising my way through life.

668
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,380
你知道了
You know.

669
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,090
我知道了  你高談闊論
I know. And you talk a big game,

670
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,260
但你其實也只是一個普通人
but you're just as human as everyone else,

671
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,870
你這自以為是的混蛋
you smug son of a bitch.

672
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,680
你想讓我做什么
What's your favor?

673
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,550
找個理由取消你周五的行程
Find a reason to cancel your trip on Friday.

674
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,540
如果之后路易·利特再試圖聯系你
And if Louis Litt ever tries to contact you after that,

675
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,820
不要接他的電話
don't take his call.

676
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,670
-看起來很簡單  -確實簡單
- Seems easy enough. - It is.

677
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,560
晚安  吉拉德教授
Have a good night, Professor Gerard.

678
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,740
但問題是  斯佩克特先生
Here's the problem, Mr. Specter.

679
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,180
我不只是高談闊論  我也會身體力行
I don't only talk a big game. I walk it.

680
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,270
職業道德從來不是指不犯錯誤
And ethics is not about never doing anything wrong.

681
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,910
而是指如何做選擇
It's about making choices.

682
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,040
我絕不會讓你替我選擇
And I'm not going to let you make my choice for me.

683
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,050
所以你想怎樣請隨便吧
So go do whatever you're gonna do,

684
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,110
我是不會取消行程的
but I'm not canceling my trip.

685
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,120
你沒搞定
You didn't get it done.

686
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,080
你怎么知道
How'd you know?

687
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,320
因為我知道如果成功了你會打電話給我的
Because I know you would call to tell me if it's okay.

688
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,480
但你沒有  所以應該是失敗了
And you didn't call, so it's not okay.

689
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,540
那你怎么還這么冷靜
Then why are you so calm?

690
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,840
因為你教我了很多
Because you've taught me enough to know

691
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,560
以至于我知道這一切都會沒事的
that it's going to be okay.

692
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,110
-不會的  -什么
- It's not. - What?

693
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,720
不會沒事的  我不知道我們要怎么辦
It's not gonna be okay. I don't see what we're gonna do.

694
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,360
什么叫你不知道我們要怎么辦
What do you mean you don't see what we're gonna do?

695
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,610
你是哈維·斯佩克特
You're Harvey Specter.

696
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,820
那又怎樣呢
What's that supposed to mean?

697
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,500
那意味著就算有槍指著你的頭
It means there's a gun pointed at our heads.

698
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,860
我們也能有146種辦法解決它
There's 146 things that we can do.

699
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,660
我們只需要齊心協力想個辦法出來
We just have to put our heads together and figure it out.

700
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,050
不然你以為我這一晚上
What the hell do you think I've been doing

701
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,170
都在干什么
all goddamn night?

702
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,220
路易抓住我們的把柄了  他不會放手的
Louis has us, he's not gonna let it go,

703
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,700
我們也沒有什么辦法能夠阻止他了
and there's nothing we can do to stop it.

704
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,460
-一定還有辦法  -沒有了
- There has to be something. - There isn't.

705
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,710
我拒絕那么想
Well, I refuse to believe that.

706
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,350
我才不在乎你怎么想
I don't give a shit what you believe.

707
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,220
早點想通吧  我不是超人
Get it through your head. I'm not superman.

708
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,030
我失敗了  我不知該怎么辦
I failed, and I don't know what to do.

709
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,040
邁克
Mike.

710
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,160
蒂姆  我以為我是和麗莎見面
Tim, I thought I was meeting with Lisa.

711
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,680
而我以為你們會公開見面
And I thought you were above board.

712
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,250
我看你讀過了我們的修正案了
I see you've read our amendment.

713
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,610
你起草的條款中有一條
You drafted a provision

714
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,010
如果他們不支付一億美元以完成制藥
that if they didn't spend $100 million finishing that drug,

715
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,110
他們將另付一億作為賠償
they'd have to pay us an extra $100 million.

716
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,910
我所起草的這條條款
I drafted a provision to see

717
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,580
是要確保他們說到做到
if they'd put their money where their mouth is.

718
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,230
你就在做你一直想做的
What you did was what you always wanted to do--

719
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,310
就是毀了這交易
tank this deal.

720
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,340
他們虛抬價
They pulled the offer.

721
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,010
他們要壓價
They yanked the offer.

722
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,280
那這筆交易就沒有開始的必要了
Then the deal wasn't worth anything to begin with.

723
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,320
你讓奎汀簽的那份
What wasn't worth anything

724
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,390
讓你的人代替我成為遺囑執行人的文件
was the document you had Quentin sign

725
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,540
才是一文不值
making you executor instead of me.

726
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,180
我沒讓奎汀簽什么文件
I didn't have Quentin sign anything.

727
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,080
好吧  你說沒有就沒有吧
Well, maybe you didn't have him sign it,

728
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,090
但我可知道他什么時候簽了的
but I know when he signed it,

729
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,690
而且這東西攔不住我的
and it's not gonna hold up.

730
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,690
當然會攔得好好的
It'll hold up just fine.

731
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,710
我們走著瞧
We'll see.

732
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,490
這是傳票
This is a subpoena.

733
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,970
所以下次我們再見
So the next time we have this conversation,

734
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,930
你就得實話實說了
you'll be under oath.

735
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,340
民事訴訟聽證會傳票

736
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,410
他到底什么意思
What exactly is he claiming?

737
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,320
他說奎汀任命我為執行人時
He's saying Quentin wasn't competent

738
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,640
并沒有判斷能力
when he made me executor.

739
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,090
那讓他說去吧
So let him say it.

740
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,940
我看來一點問題也沒有
I don't see where there's a problem.

741
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,360
不  你看出來了
Yes, you do.

742
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,260
不  我沒有
No, I don't.

743
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,750
只要站在聽證席上作證
Just get up on the stand and testify that Tim

744
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,150
證明蒂姆根本就是瞎說
doesn't know what he's talking about.

745
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,430
但事實并非如此
But he does.

746
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,990
奎汀知道他想要什么
Quentin knew what he wanted.

747
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,690
他們不會向我尋求答案
They're not going to ask me that.

748
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,030
他們只會來問我他的身體狀況
They're going to ask me about his condition.

749
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,760
我見過他了  麗莎
I saw him, Lisa.

750
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,380
我知道他是個怎樣的人
I know what he was like.

751
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,760
奎汀知道他想要什么
Quentin knew what he wanted.

752
00:29:34,450 --> 00:30:34,450
人人影視
YYeTs.com

753
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,040
他用了藥物  講話都困難
He was also medicated, could barely speak,

754
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,010
病痛纏身
and he was in a lot of pain.

755
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,210
但你不必講那些東西
But you don't have to say those things.

756
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,360
我在法庭上不得不實話實說
I'm going to have to swear to this under oath.

757
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,080
如果任你為執行人是沒有法律效力的
If making you executor wasn't legally valid,

758
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,640
那他這么做的時候你為什么不說
then why didn't you say so when he did it?

759
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,120
因為我覺得那樣不夠有挑戰
Because I didn't think it would be challenged.

760
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,420
但對于有些無關緊要的事
And thinking something might not hold up

761
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,940
在腦子里想想  緘口不提
and keeping that thought to myself

762
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,100
和在法庭上撒謊可不一樣
is not the same as lying about it under oath.

763
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,670
好吧  這是鉆模糊概念的空子
Well, those are some fuzzy damn lines.

764
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,750
概念不是我定的  現實就是如此
I didn't make them. They came with the job.

765
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,430
你就要這么推翻他的一切嗎
You're gonna undo everything he's ever worked for.

766
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,480
大概吧
Maybe.

767
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,660
但我和你目的一致
But just because you and I want the same thing

768
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,150
并不意味著我會為此做偽證
doesn't mean that I'm willing to perjure myself to get it.

769
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,110
求你了
Please.

770
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,890
你說過你不想再讓他失望了
You said you didn't want to fail him again.

771
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,640
你沒失敗
You didn't fail.

772
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,050
你不必這樣安慰我
You don't need to make me feel better.

773
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,210
我不是想安慰你
I'm not trying to make you feel better.

774
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,680
只是告訴你事實
I'm just telling you the truth.

775
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,510
你沒有失敗  因為
You didn't fail because...

776
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,320
我們一直就在爭取時間
we were always playing on borrowed time.

777
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,820
-邁克  -哈維
- Mike. - Harvey.

778
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,430
如果沒有你我不可能得到這些
I wouldn't have any of this without you.

779
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,510
我覺得是時候讓我獨當一面了
I think it's time I cut your exposure.

780
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,930
你不必如此
You don't have to do that.

781
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,250
反正都是要毀于一旦了
It's all gonna come crashing down anyway.

782
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,750
我會去找路易
I'm gonna go to Louis.

783
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,840
我會辭職
I'm going to resign,

784
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,340
我會求他放過這整件事
and I'm gonna beg him to let this whole thing go.

785
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,490
那我和你一起去
Then I'm going with you.

786
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,400
哈維
Harvey,

787
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,200
特雷弗把我的秘密告訴杰西卡時
when Trevor went to Jessica with my secret,

788
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,520
我覺得自己被背叛了
I felt betrayed.

789
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,400
我失去了我世上最好的朋友
I lost my closest friend in the world.

790
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,990
我知道你不會承認
And I know you don't like to admit it,

791
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,210
但我們確是朋友
but we're friends.

792
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,130
而我不會背叛我的朋友
And I'm not gonna betray my friend.

793
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,870
我以前可煩這種事了
I used to hate this kind of thing.

794
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,610
哪種事
What kind of thing?

795
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,460
客座講座  哈德曼以前逼著我們聽完
Guest lectures. Hardman used to make us sit through them.

796
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,130
除了之后他還會進行測驗
Except he gave tests afterwards.

797
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,660
是啊  如果你沒過  就要被罰檢閱文件
Yeah, and if you didn't pass, you got stuck on doc review.

798
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,590
該死的哈德曼
Goddamn Hardman.

799
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,020
你還記得羅賓森的案子嗎
You remember the Robinson case?

800
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,510
當然了
Sure do.

801
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,730
八萬份文件  準備了兩年
80,000 documents, two years of prep,

802
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,380
在法庭上奮戰了五個月
and five months in court.

803
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,340
而在庭審前的那個周五
And the friday before trial started,

804
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,060
他要我們倆把所有東西校對一遍
he assigned you and I to proof everything.

805
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,780
你溜走了
You blew it off.

806
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,270
而你幫我掩護
And you covered for me.

807
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,510
你把我們兩人份的都做了  然后交了
You did your half and mine, then turned it in.

808
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,750
他當場就會炒了你的
He would've fired you on the spot.

809
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,010
沒錯  但我好好的
Exactly, and I'm here

810
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,440
因為你沒有出賣朋友
Because you didn't sell out a friend then,

811
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,980
但你就要出賣了
but you're about to now.

812
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,710
-邁克嗎  -我
- Mike. - Me.

813
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,410
你是朋友
Friend?

814
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,180
路易  可能我永遠不會說出口
Louis, I may not ever say it,

815
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,630
但那并不代表我們不是朋友
but that's not because we aren't.

816
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,070
我們是朋友  你知道的
We are. You know it.

817
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,190
我知道
I know it.

818
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,990
我只是不愛說出來
I just don't like to say it.

819
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,240
上回我問你  你還說  別逼我
Last time I asked you, you said, "Don't push it."

820
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,700
你知道我的意思是答應了
You knew I meant yes.

821
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,520
我知道
I did.

822
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,980
-所以是邁克告訴你的  -是的
- So Mike told you. - He did.

823
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,450
你怎么說的
What'd you say?

824
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,080
那無所謂
Doesn't matter.

825
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,710
我的底線是  我會原諒他
Bottom line is I forgave him because I don't care

826
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,480
我才不關心那些破紙上說什么呢
what some stupid piece of paper says.

827
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,800
而我也希望你能原諒他
And I want you to forgive him too.

828
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,490
哈維  我原諒他了
Oh, Harvey, I did forgive him.

829
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,250
我只是沒法為他掩飾
I just can't cover it up for him.

830
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,480
你就為我向哈德曼打了掩護
You covered it up with Hardman for me.

831
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,970
那個周末你的所為
What you did that weekend

832
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,600
和他對吉拉德教授做的不一樣
is not the same as what he did to Professor Gerard.

833
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,030
相同之處就是吉拉德教授和哈德曼一樣
What's the same is Hardman wouldn't have let it go,

834
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,540
不會就這么算了
and Gerard won't let it go.

835
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,910
你讓邁克坦白真相
You make Mike confess,

836
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,080
無異于將他的人生徹底毀掉
you might as well throw his life down the toilet.

837
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,810
哈維  他背叛的不僅是我們
Harvey, he didn't just betray us.

838
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,060
-他這是違法  -是的
- He betrayed the law. - He did.

839
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,950
-這是不對的  -對啊
- That's not right. - It isn't.

840
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,180
但是原諒是無關對錯的
But forgiveness isn't about right and wrong.

841
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,030
路易  我知道你尊重法條
Louis, I know you value the letter of the law,

842
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,340
但法條包含的精神呢
but what about its spirit?

843
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,170
因為邁克的身上
Because Mike embodies

844
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,660
比我們倆都更體現法律的精神
that spirit more than either one of us.

845
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,460
你說過我們是朋友
You said we're friends.

846
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,380
朋友是永遠不會要求我這樣做的
A friend would not ask me to do this.

847
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,390
是不會  路易
No, Louis.

848
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,860
作為朋友  如果你不這樣做  我也不會怪罪你
A friend just won't hold it against you if you don't.

YYeTs.com

850
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,450
上帝助你  你能發誓你說的是真話
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

851
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,570
句句屬實  無半句假話嗎
and nothing but the truth, so help you god?

852
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,470
我發誓
I do.

853
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,980
但在我們開始之前  我要先聲明一下
But before we start, I'd like to make a statement.

854
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,680
我來這里說出真相
I am here to tell the truth,

855
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,420
但我希望你們明白
but what I want you to understand

856
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,440
真相也是主觀的
is that truth is subjective.

857
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,210
真相就是真相
The truth is the truth.

858
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,680
不  法律就是法律
No. The law is the law.

859
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,120
我們可以定義合法的邊界在哪里
We can define where a legal line is.

860
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,640
我說的是真相
I'm talking about the truth.

861
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,140
但真相卻復雜得多
The truth is much more complicated.

862
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,990
根據法律條文的字面義
By the letter of the law,

863
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,880
奎汀·桑茲也許不一定具有相應行為能力
Quentin Sainz may or may not have been competent.

864
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,690
我沒法兒說這些百分百是真的
I can't say what's true with 100% certainty.

865
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,730
路易·利特
法學博士

866
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,040
我不知道
I just don't know.

867
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,370
但我能確定的是
But what I can say with certainty

868
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,660
奎汀·桑茲信任我  把他最重要的利益
is that Quentin knew what he was doing

869
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,670
交由我處置時  他是理智的
when he trusted me to look after his best interests.

870
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,570
你是怎么知道的
How do you know that?

871
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,060
因為我了解他
Because I knew him.

872
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,010
因為有的人身上不具備有
Just because someone can't check off everything

873
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:52,740
某些清單列出的一切要求  并不意味著
on the list that's required to be competent doesn't mean

874
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,830
他們做什么都比我們這些人差勁
they aren't better at whatever they do than the rest of us.

875
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,930
奎汀·桑茲是個天才
And Quentin Sainz was an amazing man

876
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,830
擁有天才的頭腦
with an amazing mind.

877
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,440
如果他現在在這里
And if he were here right now,

878
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,580
比起聽其他人說
I'd still listen to him on any subject

879
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,570
我更想聽他說任何事情
sooner than I'd listen to anybody else.

880
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,810
非常感人
That's all very touching,

881
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,210
但我們不是來談真相的
but we're not here to talk about the truth.

882
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,390
我們是來處理法條的
We're here to deal with the letter of the law.

883
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,330
根據法律條文
Have you never met someone who by the letter of the law

884
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,850
有人無法做他們想做的事
shouldn't be able to do what they do,

885
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,580
-但他們克服了困難  -法官大人
- who beat the odds? - Your honor--

886
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,040
我們談的是一個人的一生
We are talking about a man's life.

887
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,420
我們談的是他的遺產
We are talking about his legacy.

888
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,630
我不認為那些事情不如
And I dispute that those things are less important

889
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,680
法條更重要
than the letter of the law.

890
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,150
法官大人  今天應該怎么做已經非常清楚了
Your honor, what has to happen today is very clear.

891
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,410
您必須消除這樁不公之事
You have to undo this injustice.

892
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,480
是的  重點就是公平
Yes. This is about justice.

893
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,440
但問題不在于奎汀·桑茲委托我作遺囑執行人時
But the issue isn't whether Quentin Sainz was competent

894
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,930
是否具有行為能力  而在于
when he made me executor, but rather,

895
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,620
如果他具有行為能力  這是不是他的意愿
would it have been his intent to do so if he were.

896
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,370
這個男人一生都撲在一項事業上
This man dedicated his life to one thing,

897
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,390
關于他如何保護那項事業的詳細情況
and the circumstances surrounding how he decided

898
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,810
不是問題所在
to protect that thing is not the question.

899
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,320
這是法律問題  皮爾森女士
It's a question of law, Ms. Pearson.

900
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,760
不  這是關于做正確決定的問題
No, it is a question of doing what is right.

901
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,770
路易
Louis.

902
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,010
你來這里做什么
What the hell are you doing here?

903
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,050
-我  -我告訴你要在午餐前
- I-- - I told you I needed

904
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,300
搞定卡瑞爾的歸檔文件  但你沒搞定
the Carell filings by lunch-- you didn't get that done,

905
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,540
所以現在你不能來聽這門課
so now you don't get to listen to this lecture.

906
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,750
你不能來聽我們關于法律職業道德的巔峰對話
You do not get to listen to this titan talk about legal ethics.

907
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,180
你讓我覺得很惡心
You know something, you make me sick.

908
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,650
快幫我個忙  向他道歉
So do me a quick favor and tell him you're sorry

909
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,900
然后趕緊滾開
and get the hell out of here.

910
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,300
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

911
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,710
我接受你的道歉
I accept your apology,

912
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,380
但我沒什么委屈的
but I'm not the aggrieved one here.

913
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,600
路易才委屈
Louis is.

914
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,290
路易
Louis...

915
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,100
-我很抱歉  -行了
- I'm sorry. - Yeah.

916
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,390
他不是我的人  走吧
It's not my pony. Come on.

917
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,910
駁回關于撤除杰西卡·皮爾遜作為遺囑執行人的動議
Motion to remove Jessica Pearson as executor denied.

918
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,420
你說得對
Well, you were right.

919
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,330
奎汀·桑茲心中有數的
Quentin did know what he was doing.

920
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,900
我知道到最后
I know how hard it must have been...

921
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,940
有多艱難
at the end.

922
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,650
我很慶幸奎汀擁有你
I'm glad Quentin had you.

923
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,810
我也很慶幸他擁有你
I'm glad he had you too.

924
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,630
他手下留情了
He let it go.

925
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,570
我聽說都搞定了
I heard it all worked out.

926
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,470
毫無疑問啊
Never a doubt.

927
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,660
我為你準備了個禮物
I've got a present for you.

928
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,900
蒂芙尼
Tiffany.

929
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,560
"D.J.S"
"D.J.S."

930
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,760
這是為斯科特準備的禮物
This is a present for Scottie.

931
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,770
也就是為你準備的禮物
Which makes it a present for you.

932
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,080
-把這個放進她的辦公室吧  -太好了
- Let's put this in her office. - Great.

933
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,520
跟你那瓶特別貴的威士忌放在一起吧
We can put it next to your overpriced bottle of scotch.

934
00:39:34,450 --> 00:40:34,450

935
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,890
真是個很棒的禮物啊
So it was a great gift.

936
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,050
現在確實是
Now it is.

937
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,700
準確的說  她的中間名是維多利亞
For the record, her middle name is Victoria.

938
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,950
不對  不是
No, it isn't.

939
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,970
那是什么
What is it?

940
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,420
拜托  她沒告訴過我
Please, she never told me.

941
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,110
朱莉
Julie?

942
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,090
-真的嗎  -杰西
- Seriously? - J essie?

943
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,410
-天吶  -喬伊嗎
- Oh, my god. - Joy?

944
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,290
-你太可悲了  -還是珍妮
- You're pathetic. - Jenny?

945
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,390
不會告訴你的
Not telling.

946
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,170
這樣恐怕不太好吧
I don't think this is a good idea.

947
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:03,880
我不管
I don't care.

948
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,220
他們能怎么著  炒了咱倆嗎
What are they gonna do, fire us?

949
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,410
邁克  過去六年
Mike, I haven't left before 5:00

950
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,080
我從未五點前下班
in the past six years.

951
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,500
那就更有理由去了
All the more reason to do it.

952
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,120
你想干什么
Now what do you want to do?

953
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,090
看個電影  吃個晚飯  再去喝兩杯
See a movie, grab dinner, get a drink?

954
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,510
我只想回家
I just want to go home.

955
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,910
好  那就回家
Yeah. Let's go home.

956
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,800
最近好像老有人來啊
People seem to keep coming in here lately.

957
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,390
我想聽點音樂
I needed to hear some music.

958
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,550
喝點威士忌
And drink some scotch.

959
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,460
這兩樣怎么能不配在一起呢
How often do you really do one without the other?

960
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,400
坐過去
Move over.

961
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,210
你搞定你的大麻煩了嗎
Did you take care of your Marcus problem?

962
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,320
暫時解決了
For the time being.

963
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,490
很好
Good.

964
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,000
其實問題并不是我之前說的那個
It wasn't really a Marcus problem.

965
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,630
我知道
I know.

966
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,480
你想聽實話嗎
You want to hear the truth?

967
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,560
今晚別說了
Not tonight.

968
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,210
所以我開始才沒有告訴你
That's why I didn't tell you in the first place.

969
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,680
我知道
I know.
