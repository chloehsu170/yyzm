塔拉・梅瑟  你愿意嫁给我吗
Tara Messer, will you marry me?

31
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,370
愿意  路易  我愿意
Yes, Louis, I'll marry you.

32
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,110
哈维  我不在乎你挣多少钱
I don't care how much money you make

33
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,900
或者睡过多少女人
or how many you women you sleep with.

34
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,550
你的生活存在问题
You have issues in your life

35
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,260
会导致你难以获得真正的爱情
that are going to keep you from having real relationships.

36
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,540
我们的软件和另一个公司的产品
Benjamin and I have an overlap on our software

37
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,600
存在重合部分
with another company.

38
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,340
他使劲了浑身解数拿到了这个
Louis pulled out every trick in the book to get us this.

39
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,550
-那就把钱收下吧  -我想要的不是钱
- Take the money. - I don't want the money.

40
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,510
-唐娜  -我想要更多
- Donna-- - I want something more.

41
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,660
你说"更多"是什么意思
What do you mean more? 

42
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,570
我做了个交易  我们解决矿工的案子
I made a deal that we would handle the miners' case

43
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,540
以换取进入律师协会的机会
in exchange for the chance to be admitted to the Bar.

44
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,180
你在逗我吗  你被解雇了
Are you goddamn kidding me? You're fired.

45
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,350
-别这样  -他撒谎  而且不止一次
- Don't do it. - He lied--not once, not twice--

46
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,940
我不在乎  因为我们需要他
I don't care because we need him.

47
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,350
周一早晨  你最好拿出实际行动
Monday morning, you better start putting your money

48
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,110
再为我们接个能赚五万美元的案子
where your mouth is and find us another $50,000 case.

49
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,040
塔拉给我留了个十五秒的留言
Tara left a 15-second voicemail.

50
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,190
内容不是要跟我说她再也不想见到我了
She's either gonna tell me that she never wants to see me again

51
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,590
就是要和好
or she wants to make up.

52
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,890
那是什么
What's that?

53
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,350
预付你一年工资  欢迎回来
Your first year's salary in advance. Welcome back.

54
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,490
哈维  我已经不知道
Harvey, I'm running out of ways 

55
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,330
该怎么告诉你我不想做企业律师了
to tell you I don't want to be a corporate lawyer.

56
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,100
我提出了个交易  为你  也为我
I'm offering you a deal. One for you, one for me.

57
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,550
赞助诊所一年  不够
I don't wanna just fund the clinic for a year.

58
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,470
我要两年的赞助
I want to fund it for two, 

59
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,640
我想给诊所什么案子  就给什么案子
and any case I want to bring the clinic onto, I can. 

60
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,190
成交
Done.

61
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,400
-还有一件事  -你别想要我的办公室
- And there's one more thing. - You are not getting my office.

62
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,160
我不仅要  还要告诉你为什么该给我
Oh, yes, I am, and I will tell you why.

63
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,030
-为什么  -因为她走了  哈维
- Why? - 'Cause she's gone, Harvey.

64
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,900
是时候由你掌权了
It's time for you to take the reins.

65
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,700
哈维  你来做什么
Harvey. What are you doing here?

66
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,680
没事  我就是开着这车兜兜风
Nothing, I was just driving this baby around

67
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,500
然后想起你家这边车位多
and remembered how much street parking you had.

68
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,030
你是想打动我吗
Is that supposed to impress me?

69
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,650
希望能  我是很受打动的
Well, I hope so. Sure as hell impresses me.

70
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,810
见到你很高兴
Well, it's nice to see you, 

71
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,090
但如果你想预约  应该先打电话
but if you wanted an appointment, you should have called.

72
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,330
我不是来预约的
I'm not here for an appointment.

73
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,570
我来约你出去
I'm here to ask you out.

74
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,710
你是认真的
You're serious.

75
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,330
我最近想了很多
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, and...

76
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,000
-哈维  -求你  让我说完
- Harvey... - Please, let me finish.

77
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
我们上次分别之后  情况变了很多
Things have changed since the last time I saw you.

78
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
我已经不是之前的我了
I'm not the same man that I was.

79
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,940
我跟家人和解
I made peace with my family;

80
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,780
我以前的同事也回来了
I got my old associate back,

81
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,040
从今早起  我是公司的老板了
and as of this morning, I'm the head of my firm,

82
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,220
当我去想该跟谁分享这一切时
and when I thought of sharing that with someone,

83
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,250
我想到了你
I thought of you.

84
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,620
这些不重要
Well, it doesn't matter,

85
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,840
因为医生跟病人约会
because it's completely unethical for a doctor

86
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,840
完全有违道德
to engage in a relationship with her patient.

87
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
隔了足够的时间就无所谓
Not if enough time has passed, 

88
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,500
而按心理学协会的规定
and according to the APA,

89
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,980
三周前  间隔的时间就足够了
as of three weeks ago, enough time has passed.

90
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,870
-调查的很细致  -当然
- You did your homework. - Sure did.

91
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,030
所以唯一的问题是
So the only question is:

92
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,560
周四八点  还是周六九点
Thursday at 8:00 or Saturday at 9:00?

93
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,750
就一顿饭  如果你显然认为存在的
One dinner, and if this chemistry you

94
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,840
火花并不存在  那我们友好分别
so clearly think exists doesn't, then we part as friends,

95
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,020
不伤感情
no hard feelings.

96
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,470
如果不成
If it doesn't work out,

97
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,060
没伤害  不犯规
no harm, no foul.

98
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,190
周四
Thursday.

99
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,750
如果车太酷炫了
And if the car's too much,

100
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,770
我还是可以让雷开车的
I can always have Ray drive.

101
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,210
我喜欢这车
I like the car.

102
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,830
你说什么  我没听到
What did you say? I couldn't hear you.

103
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,450
我喜欢你的车
I like the car.

104
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,510
很好  你早到了
Good. You're here early.

105
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,630
我需要你为桑德拉办一起消费者诈骗的听证会
I need you to take poing on a consumer fraud hearing for Sandra. 

106
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,350
纳森  我们得谈谈
Nathan, I need to talk to you.

107
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,390
好吧
Okay.

108
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,890
我知道那天晚上我们吵得有点凶
I know things got heated between us the other night,

109
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,490
但就我看来  那都过去了
but as far as I'm concerned, it's water under the bridge,

110
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,960
如果你在想我是不是还生你的气
so if you're wondering if I'm still upset at you--

111
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,890
我没有
I'm not.

112
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,660
这是为了确保你听完我要说的
And this is to make sure you're still not upset with me

113
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,390
能继续保持不生我的气
after you hear what I'm about to say.

114
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,400
我为什么拿着一张五十万美元的支票
Why am I holding a check for $500,000?

115
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,920
因为我决定回皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所
Because I've decided to go back to Pearson Specter Litt,

116
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,610
我向你保证过不会抛下你
and I gave you my word that I wouldn't leave you high and dry.

117
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,400
是这样吗  你改了主意
So let me get this straight: you changed your mind,

118
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,660
现在哈维・斯佩克特要买你回去
and now Harvey Specter is buying you back?

119
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,770
如果哈维能说了算  你一分都别想捞到
If it were up to Harvey, you wouldn't be getting a penny.

120
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,620
这是我坚持的
I insisted on this.

121
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,590
我还坚持从今后  我每隔一个案子
Just like I insisted on every other case I take

122
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,200
就办一个无偿案
from now on being pro bono. 

123
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,340
听上去你这么做是为了让自己良心好受
It sounds like you insisted on that to make yourself feel better.

124
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,460
不  纳森  我那么做
No, Nathan, I did that

125
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,000
是因为我喜欢做这样的工作
because I care about doing this kind of work,

126
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,810
如果你接受  我甚至愿意
and if you're okay with it, I'd even like the idea

127
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,630
偶尔跟你们合作一些案子
of us partnering on a case every now and then.

128
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,570
但如果我说我不接受这些呢
But what if I say I'm not okay with any of this?

129
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,780
我知道是你在别人都不愿再给我机会
I know that you were the one that gave me another chance

130
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,810
做律师时  给了我机会
to be a lawyer when no one else would,

131
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,280
但别惩罚诊所
but don't punish the clinic.

132
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,050
这是笔大钱  用这钱  你可以另找人
It's a lot of money. With that, you could replace me

133
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,030
并在很长一段时间里帮助很多人
and help a lot of people for a long time.

134
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,400
-那是给我的吗  -不  其实是给我的
- Is that for me? - No, actually, it's for me.

135
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,790
你今晚比以往晚
You're later than usually this morning.

136
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,750
我等了你好一会儿
I've been waiting for you. 

137
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,120
唐娜  那晚的事
Donna, about the other night.

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,730
我知道你说想要更多  但先听我...
I know you said you wanted more, but before you say anything--

139
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,270
-我想做合伙人  -合伙人
- I want to be a partner. - Partner?

140
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,550
是的  我知道我想要什么了
Yes. I figured out what I want,

141
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,200
我想做律所的合伙人
and I want to be a partner at this firm.

142
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,760
唐娜  我无意侮辱你
Donna, I don't mean to insult you,

143
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,420
但你都不是律师
but you're not even a lawyer.

144
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,050
很好  因为我成为合伙人跟法律无关
Good, because my being a partner isn't about the law.

145
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,490
而是维持律所的运作
It's about keeping this firm running,

146
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,470
而这本就是我一直在做的
which I've been doing for as long as I can remember.

147
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,090
我知道  但那不代表我能让你...
I know that, but it doesn't mean that I can get you--

148
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,080
我为这里奉献了十多年  哈维
I've given over ten years of my life to this place, Harvey,

149
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
仅以你秘书的身份我都维持住了律所
and I've done it all from your desk.

150
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,400
我只求一个决策的位置
All I'm asking is for a seat at the table.

151
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,760
这我得跟路易商量
I'll have to ask Louis about it.

152
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,980
那么你是同意了吗
Does that mean that you're on board?

153
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,140
我不知道  今天迈克第一天回来
I don't know. It's Mike's first day back,

154
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,240
这事不小  不仅如此
it's a big ask, and on top of all of that,

155
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,890
我还决定告诉路易
I've decided to tell Louis

156
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,130
我要作为经营合伙人完全做主
that I'm taking full control as managing partner.

157
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,340
恭喜  哈维  但究竟是哪个
Well, congratulations, Harvey, but which is it?

158
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,380
路易  迈克
Louis? Mike?

159
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,060
"不小的事"  因为我不希望
"Big ask." Because I'd hate to think

160
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,810
我鼓起勇气来这么做
I mustered the courage to do this,

161
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,330
可你一上了电梯  就抛在脑后了
and then once you get on that elevator, it's out of your mind.

162
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,970
我保证  我不会忘记的
I give you my word. I will not forget about it.

163
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,760
好
Okay.

164
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,910
*看到钱  就愿意留下吃饭*
*See the money, wanna stay for your meal*

165
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,330
*给你太太再拿块馅饼*
*Get another piece of pie for your wife*

166
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,670
*所有人都想知道那感觉*
*Everybody wanna know how it feel*

167
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,830
*所有人都想见见那景象*
*Everybody wanna see what it's like*

168
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,230
*豆子馅饼我也愿吃  我不在乎*
*I'll even eat a bean pie, I don't mind*

169
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,250
*我和妹子忙着赚钱*
*Me and Missy is so busy, busy making money*

170
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,330
*好了*
*All right*

171
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,120
*退开点  我要跳舞*
*All step back, I'm 'bout to dance*

172
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,140
{\an8}诉讼双雄 第七季 第一集

173
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,170
*美钞爵士摇摇摇*
*The greenback boogie*

174
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,850
你是睡在这里了吗
Did you sleep in here?

175
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,940
只是来感受一下我的新办公室
Just getting a feel for my new office.

176
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,090
你觉得这墙上能挂得下自行车架吗
You think a bike rack would fit on this wall?

177
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,480
你敢装自行车架  你的第一个无偿案
You put a bike rack in here, your first pro bono,

178
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,330
就只能在我把车塞进你屁股后  自己去打了
you'll be representing yourself after I shove it up your ass.

179
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,950
听上去很不舒服
Wow. That sounds uncomfortable.

180
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,430
说到无偿案
Now, speaking of pro bonos,

181
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,200
你什么时候能把你家老头子的唱片拿出去
when are you gonna get your old man records out of here

182
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,980
好让我安顿下来开始工作
so I can settle in and get to work?

183
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,520
等我们搞定了尼尔・斯蒂尔曼我就搬
I'll get out of here once we take of Neil Stillman.

184
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,190
尼尔・斯蒂尔曼  迪特尔工业那个
Neil Stillman? Detour Industries?

185
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,220
不  尼尔・斯蒂尔曼  绝地议会那个
No, Neil Stillman, Jedi counsel.

186
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,670
好吧  我问是因为尼尔・斯蒂尔曼是公司客户
Okay, I was asking because Neil Stillman is a corporate client,

187
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,100
不是先给我一个我要的  再一个你要的吗
so what happened to one for me, then one for you?

188
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,670
要我提醒你  在企业法律所
Do I need to remind you that at a corporate law firm,

189
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,780
我们优先接手利润丰厚的案子吗
we do the cases that pay the bills first?

190
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,930
更何况  我还没告诉你最妙的部分
Besides, I haven't even told you the best part yet.

191
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,010
再过两星期你就要离开人世了吗
You only got two weeks to live?

192
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,770
不是  等这个案子结束
No. After we're done with this case,

193
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,650
我把尼尔・斯蒂尔曼给你
I'm giving you Neil Stillman.

194
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,740
哈维  我很感谢你的好意  但说实话
Harvey, I appreciate that, but seriously,

195
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,540
既然案子结束你就要把他给我
if you're just gonna give him to me when we're done,

196
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,850
为何不干脆现在就给我
why don't you give him to me now?

197
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,620
无论发生什么情况  我都能处理好
Whatever it is, I can handle it myself.

198
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,470
-我知道  -那你到底是为什么
- I know that. - Then what's going on?

199
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,830
我们完全没有必要一起办这个案子
It doesn't make sense for us to be working together on this.

200
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,450
行  你想听真话
All right, you want the truth?

201
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,680
杰西卡成为管理合伙人后
When Jessica made managing partner,

202
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,680
我和她就不怎么一起办案子了
she and I never really got to do cases together anymore.

203
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,230
你们之前一起办过案子
You used to work on cases together?

204
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,490
是  当年她和我就是现在的我和你
Yeah. She was me and I was you.

205
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,970
黄金组合
We kicked ass.

206
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,760
是吗  那这黄金组合里你主要负责什么
Right. And what exactly did you contribute to the equation?

207
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,610
引用电影台词吐槽  但这不是重点
Oh, movie quotes, mostly, but that's not the point.

208
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,920
重点是我们在一起工作真的很开心
The point is we had a great time doing it.

209
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,460
-哈维  -迈克  我说真的
- Harvey... - Mike, I'm serious.

210
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,270
杰西卡一晋升  我们的关系就变了
Once Jessica stepped up, our relationship changed.

211
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,510
而如果你早知道会如此
And if you'd known that was gonna happen,

212
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,080
肯定希望当时能再一起办最后一个案子
you would have wanted one last case together.

213
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,010
没错  所以怎么样
Exactly. So what do you say?

214
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,450
一起出去找点乐子  顺便大杀四方
We go out and have some fun and kick some ass?

215
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,970
还是留在这里量你的单车架
Or do you want to stay here measuring for your bike rack?

216
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,710
但我不量就没人量了
It's not gonna measure itself.

217
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,190
好好好  我选办案子
All right, fine. Kick ass.

218
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,620
不过这个案子里  我要当绝地律师
But we do this, I want on that Jedi counsel.

219
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,680
长袍  光之剑  都得有
Robes, light saber, whole deal.

220
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,090
你来了  太好了
Good, you're here.

221
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,340
格雷琴  你来干什么
Gretchen, what are you doing here?

222
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,270
-给你送东西  -什么东西
- I'm here to give you these. - What are those?

223
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,390
北半球前九泥浆温泉度假村
Brochures from the top nine mud resorts

224
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,770
宣传册
in the northern hemisphere,

225
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,950
虽然我是不能理解泡泥浴的意义
though I don't know why a person would do that in the first place.

226
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,690
基本等同于泡在自己的粪便里
It's like sitting in a bathtub of your own poop.

227
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,440
你到底想说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

228
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,680
路易  你需要休息
Louis, you need to take yourself some time off.

229
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,790
你还记得你上次休假是什么时候吗
When's the last time you even had a vacation?

230
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,160
9年前的7月
Nine years ago July.

231
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,150
倒霉旅行社给我卖了份地中海俱乐部的孟加拉套餐
Goddamn travel agent sold me a package to Club Med Bangladesh,

232
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,520
所以  绝不
so, hard pass.

233
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,730
什么样的人会去转孟加拉色情俱乐部
What kind of person goes to a sex club in Bangladesh?

234
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,940
不是那样
It's not like that.

235
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,680
我当时刚看完《贫民窟的百万富翁》
I had just seen "Slumdog Millionaire,"

236
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,210
我是想去找寻芙蕾达・平托
and I was trying to find Freida Pinto.

237
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,230
没记错的话她住在伦敦吧
I believe she considers London her place of habitat.

238
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,710
不  我不是说真-芙蕾达・平托
No, I'm not talking about the real Freida Pinto.

239
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,680
我是说属于我的芙蕾达・平托
I'm talking about my Freida Pinto.

240
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,920
叫芙蕾达・平托的人多了去了好吗
There's many different Freida Pintos out there, okay?

241
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,350
所以  我不是白痴  别来烦我
So just--I'm not an idiot. Leave me alone.

242
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,080
路易  我是担心你再这样无所事事郁闷下去
Louis, I'm just worried that if you sit around and stew,

243
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,990
会因为这次分手做出出格的事
this breakup's gonna get the best of you.

244
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,470
格雷琴  我真心感谢你的好意
Gretchen, I really appreciate that,

245
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,520
但我不会无所事事的
but I'm not just gonna sit around.

246
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,830
我将会把伤心焚化为滋润助理们的沃土
I'm gonna be pouring my heartbreak into those new associates.

247
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,170
这样真的好吗
Are you sure that's the best idea?

248
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,790
听着
Look...

249
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,760
我不只是失去了塔拉
I didn't just lose Tara.

250
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,850
我还失去了成为爸爸的机会
I lost a chance at being a father.

251
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,720
而我一直将助理们视如己出
And those associates have always been my children to me.

252
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,320
他们是我的孩子
My children.

253
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,870
而且事实是
And the truth is,

254
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,880
他们进公司后我都没怎么管他们
I've been neglecting them ever since they got here,

255
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,630
但这种情况就到今早为止了
but that ends this morning.

256
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,780
路易  我为你骄傲
I'm proud of you, Louis.

257
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,670
谢谢你  格雷琴
Thank you, Gretchen.

258
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,180
你跑哪儿去了
Where the hell have you been?

259
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,940
尼尔  你一小时前给我打的电话
Neil, you called an hour ago.

260
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,040
也就意味着你应该在半小时内赶到
Well, that means you should have been here in 30 minutes.

261
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,290
可能你不知道  我不是超时免费的披萨快递
Well, I got news for you: I'm not Dominos.

262
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,910
真不幸  因为如果你继续掉链子
That's too bad, because slinging pizzas

263
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,180
做披萨饼搞不好
might be the only job you can get

264
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,650
就是你唯一能做的工作了
if you don't stop shitting the bed.

265
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,420
掉链子  怎么讲
Shitting the bed? How's that?

266
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,500
这两个周我一直在给你打电话
I've been trying to get you on the phone for two weeks.

267
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,730
杰西卡走了  突然之间
Jessica leaves, and all of a sudden,

268
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,030
我就没人管了吗
I start falling through the cracks?

269
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,100
不会没人管  现在我来了
You're not falling through anything. I'm here now,

270
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,900
而且我还带来了最好的初级合伙人
and I brought the best junior partner in the firm.

271
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,280
他就是最好的初级勤杂工也无所谓
I don't give a shit if he's the best junior towel boy.

272
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,150
我有工作交给你  而且十分紧急
I got something for you to do, and I want it done yesterday.

273
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,700
我猜你是想卖掉伏特加酒厂的业务
Let me guess, you want to sell your vodka business.

274
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,130
你怎么知道的
How the hell could you know that?

275
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,260
因为如果你不打算把它卖掉
Because you don't clean up the balance sheet

276
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,280
就不会想要在公司重组半年之后
of your third largest division six months after you restructure

277
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,760
动第三大部门的资产负债表
if you're not looking to put it on the market.

278
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,960
好  我承认你带的人不错
Okay, you brought the right guy.

279
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,300
我想知道的是  你动作怎么这么慢
My question is, what took so long?

280
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,130
我想知道的是  那么着急干什么
And my question is what's the rush?

281
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,090
"因为如果不是为势所迫
'Cause you also don't ram a transaction through

282
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:46,860
你根本就不必急于脱手
if you don't have to.

283
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,790
我有并购另一个公司的机会
I have an opportunity to buy another company,

284
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,930
-我不想让机会流失掉  -什么公司
- and I don't wanna let it slip away. - What company?

285
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,700
-我可以帮你做尽职调查  -俄罗斯的
- I'll start vetting them for you. - They're Russian,

286
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,800
他们家的业务叫
and they make a little product

287
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,670
不关你事
called none of your goddamn business.

288
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,630
尼尔  为什么这么藏着掖着
Neil, what's with the secrecy?

289
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,350
我们是你的律师
We're your lawyers.

290
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,680
我们需要知道你的打算
We need to know what you're looking to do.

291
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,990
藏着掖着是以防着两周后
The secrecy is in case you're not my lawyers

292
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,280
你们不再是我的律师
two weeks from now.

293
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,950
我不想你们知道我要并购哪家
I don't want you knowing who I'm going after.

294
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,950
你在威胁我们吗
Is that a threat?

295
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,020
这只是确保
It's just my way of making sure

296
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,800
你们不会再甩手不管我的手段
I don't keep falling through the cracks.

297
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,690
现在我们来谈谈条款吧
Now let's talk terms.

298
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,660
早上好  格雷琴  你见到路易了吗
Good morning, Gretchen. Have you seen Louis?

299
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,620
昨晚的事之后  我有点担心他
I'm worried about how he's doing after last night.

300
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,020
我估计他是在拿他的小鸟雏们弥补空虚
My guess is he's in the bullpen with his hatchlings.

301
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,970
他的小鸟雏们
His hatchlings?

302
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,780
我和你一样担心此事
I was concerned about him as you were,

303
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,930
所以之前我打算逼他休假
so I tried to get him to take a vacation.

304
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,320
结果他说他更想好好培养助理
He said he'd rather focus on raising those associates.

305
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,420
好好培养还是好好出气
Focus on them or take it out on them?

306
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,820
就我对他的了解  一半一半
Knowing him, probably 50/50,

307
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,580
但是他拒绝了去世界
but the man turned down a trip

308
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,570
最好的泥浆温泉度假村的机会
to the finest mud resorts in the world,

309
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,240
所以我姑且相信他好的可能更大
so I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.

310
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,600
那我也相信他吧
Then I will too.

311
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,040
早安  孩子们
Good morning, boys and girls.

312
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,360
谁准备好干掉沃森工业了
Who's ready to tear Watson Industries a new asshole?

313
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,450
这才是好样的  现在在你们的桌子上
That's what I like to see. Now, on your desks,

314
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,000
每个人都发了一份我写的简报初稿
I've made each of you a copy of my initial brief.

315
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,550
要掌握到如数家珍的地步
Cling to it as if you wrote it yourself,

316
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,630
如果有人需要去卫生间
and if any of you need to go to the bathroom,

317
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,850
我建议现在赶紧去  因为接下来两周
I suggest you do it now, because for the next two weeks,

318
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,670
我们都要在这间屋子里过
we are not leaving this room.

319
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,980
谁也不许大便  小便都不行
No one will be shitting. No one will be pissing.

320
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,280
-谁也...  -问吧  问他
- No-- - Go ahead, ask him.

321
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,520
问我什么
Ask me what?

322
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,440
我听说了你的事迹 但是
I heard about your reputation, but...

323
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,450
但是什么
But what?

324
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,640
不用担心我的事迹  孩子
Don't you worry about my reputation, son.

325
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,350
我已经不再是过去的路易了
I am not the same Louis I used to be.

326
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,190
我也许还是很严格  但我也通情达理
I still may be tough, but I have a soft spot,

327
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,360
你有什么需要
so what do you need?

328
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,320
两天假
Two days off.

329
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,540
没问题
No problem.

330
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,210
周六周日你可以休息
Feel free to take Saturday and Sunday off.

331
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,860
他是说周末之外还需要请假
He meant in addition to the weekend.

332
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,700
之外  布莱恩  是这样吗
In addition? Brian, is this true?

333
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,570
-是的  -那么
- Yes. - Then...

334
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,920
周日和周一允许你休假
Monday and Sunday you shall have.

335
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,930
好吧好吧  周一周二
Okay, fine. Monday and Tuesday it is.

336
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,180
-谢谢  利特先生  -不不不  叫路易
- Thank you, Mr. Litt. - No, no, just call me Louis.

337
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,310
介意我问问请假原因吗
Mind if I ask what the occasion is?

338
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,290
-我要当父亲了  -什么
- I'm gonna be a father. - What?

339
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,710
我们要有儿子了
We're gonna have a baby boy.

340
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,010
一个大家都知道你是不可能有的东西
Something everybody here knows is never gonna happen to you.

341
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,750
要当父亲了
Gonna be a father

342
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,080
当一辈子哦
for the rest of his life.

343
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,630
-你说什么  -我说剖腹产
- What'd you just say to me? - I said it's a C-section,

344
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,620
因为孩子有点移位
'cause the baby's actually sideways,

345
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,690
所以我们要...
which means we have to go in there...

346
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,190
你这个目中无人的混蛋
You self-centered piece of shit.

347
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,000
你以为我是真的想知道吗
Do you think I care about the graphic details?

348
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,650
-我只是以为...  -以为什么
- I just thought-- - Thought what?

349
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,740
以为你根本不在乎自己的工作吗
That you don't give a shit about your job?

350
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,200
我告诉你  你人在这里  就得工作
Let me tell you something: when you work here, you work here.

351
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,460
不允许想家想亲人想孩子
You don't think about home and families and babies.

352
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,560
所以下次你要把你的私人生活
So the next time you want to put your personal life

353
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,270
置于公司需求之上时
ahead of the needs of this firm,

354
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,900
最好提前一年跟我请假
you better goddamn come to me a year in advance.

355
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,720
这不公平
That's not fair.

356
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,120
他不可能提前一年知道要生孩子...
He couldn't have known he was gonna have a baby a year--

357
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,450
我告诉你  斯蒂芬妮
Let me tell you something, Stephanie:

358
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,660
也许是你不清楚生孩子的事
maybe you don't know how babies are made,

359
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,380
因为想要孩子的人  就知道自己在尝试
because when people are trying, they know they're trying,

360
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,920
就因为没人愿意和你尝试
and just because no one ever wants to try with you

361
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,990
不代表你就有权
doesn't give you the right

362
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,300
教我怎么管理助理
to tell me how to run my associates.

363
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,660
听懂了吗
You got that?

364
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,740
懂了
Got it.

365
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,040
你在想我在想的吗
You thinking what I'm thinking?

366
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,290
不一定  你在想什么
Depends. What are you thinking?

367
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,280
我在想我们有加伏特加酒厂要卖了
I'm thinking we've got a vodka company to sell.

368
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,060
你还说过你想找点乐子
You already said you wanted to have some fun.

369
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,740
没错  二者相加
That's right, and you put those two together,

370
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,100
结论是什么
what have we got?

371
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,650
派对
Party. 

372
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,000
看  我们达成一致了
See? We're already on the same page.

373
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,560
不如你去找个好地方
Why don't you get a kick-ass location,

374
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,540
-我负责找模特  -模特
- and I'll get the models. - Models?

375
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,830
我喜欢模特  为什么不能让我找模特
I like models. Why can't I get the models?

376
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,280
有道理
You make a good point.

377
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,500
这活需要两个人  我们一起找吧
It's a two-man job. We'll both get the models.

378
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,850
哈维  说真的  这个派对
Harvey, seriously, why do we even have to 

379
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,430
为什么需要模特
have models at this party?

380
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,130
两个原因  其一  大家想看模特
Well, two reasons. First, people expect it,

381
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,120
总要满足大家的需求
and you've got to give the people what they want.

382
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,420
没错  其二
Right, and second,

383
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,860
到场的凡是整晚调戏模特的人
any dipshit who shows up and hits on the models all night

384
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,900
都不是诚意买家
isn't a serious bidder for the company.

385
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,650
看来你确实有资格入住我办公室了
Huh, you really are ready for my office.

386
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,190
说到你办公室
Hey, speaking of which, 

387
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,680
你到底什么时候让出来
when exactly is that gonna happen.

388
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,970
现在没空说这个
I can't talk about that right now.

389
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,200
我忙着去调戏模特呢
I got to go hit on some models. 

390
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,820
哈维  撇开玩笑话
Hey, Harvey,jokes aside, 

391
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,960
之前你说
what you said before about

392
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,180
希望我们像以前一样一起办案
us working together like the old days,

393
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,480
我很感激
I appreciate it.

394
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,930
对我意义重大
It means a lot to me.

395
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,370
我也是
Me too.

396
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,730
-没种  -没种
- Pussy. - Pussy.

397
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,920
唐娜  有时间吗  我需要你帮忙
Donna, do you have a minute? I need your help.

398
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,030
没问题  怎么了
Of course. What's going on?

399
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,700
路易已经失控了
Louis is out of control.

400
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,530
是艾斯特婚姻问题那种失控
When Esther got married out of control,

401
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,890
还是哈维当上高级合伙人那种
or when Harvey made senior partner out of control?

402
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,300
还要糟
Worse.

403
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,860
那糟了  他做了什么
Shit. What did he do?

404
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,590
冲助理们发火去了
He just went off on the associates.

405
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,340
异常狂暴  残忍而且可怕
He was abusive and cruel and ugly.

406
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,970
唐娜  我从来没见过这样的路易
Donna, I have never seen Louis like this before.

407
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,390
瑞秋  如果真如你所说
Rachel, if what you're saying is true,

408
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,240
那我们就需要弄清楚原因
then we need to figure out why,

409
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,670
因为路易这样从来都是为某件事...
because with Louis, there's always a reason--

410
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,930
塔拉昨晚和他分手了
Tara broke up with him last night.

411
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,140
-天哪  -他得知消息时我就在场
- Oh, my God. - I was there when it happened.

412
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,840
这不是什么他能很快放下的事
This is not something that he's going to get over quickly.

413
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,450
-你什么意见  -我建议
- So what are you saying? - I'm saying that

414
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,230
应该由我接管助理
I think I should take over the associates

415
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,200
直到他能控制好自己的情绪
until he's able to get his emotions under control.

416
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,650
瑞秋  夺走他的助理
Rachel, taking the associates away

417
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,290
可不是能稳定他的办法
isn't exactly gonna stabilize him.

418
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,710
这是他仅剩的了
That's the one thing he has.

419
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,160
我知道  但我必须说
Yeah, I know that, but I'm telling you,

420
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,130
如果处理不好  肯定会有人报复他
if we're not careful, someone's gonna do something to him,

421
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,310
到时候只是被告都得算他幸运了
and he'll be lucky if it's just suing him.

422
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,990
这话你跟他说了吗
Did you tell him that?

423
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,050
我去找他了  刚进他办公室
I tried to, and he bit my head off

424
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,670
就被他一通痛骂  所以...
the minute I walked into his office, so...

425
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,000
好  我去找他谈
Okay, I'll talk to him.

426
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,080
但你得先把事情原原本本告诉我
But I'm gonna need you to tell me exactly what he did first.

427
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,010
不管什么事我现在都没空  唐娜
Whatever it is, I don't have time, Donna.

428
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,880
据我所知  你今早倒是有空
From what I heard, you had time

429
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,430
去跟助理们发火呢
to go off on the associates this morning.

430
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,720
谁跟你说的  胡扯
Who told you that? That's bullshit.

431
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,580
你是说你没有冲布莱恩・阿特曼发火
Are you telling me you didn't go off on Brian Altman

432
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,020
然后又对斯蒂芬妮・帕特尔的
and then make a horrible comment

433
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,780
性生活进行了言辞激烈的评论吗
about Stephanie Patel's sex life?

434
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,640
这叫管教  唐娜
It's called discipline, Donna.

435
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,070
这叫可诉  路易
It's called actionable, Louis.

436
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,190
你现在没有已经被告
You're lucky that there isn't a lawsuit

437
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,060
已经是幸运了
on your desk right now.

438
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,270
谢谢你的忠告
Well, thank you for your counsel.

439
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,260
我知道我在做什么
I know what I'm doing.

440
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,130
路易  我在努力体谅你
Louis, I am trying to be understanding,

441
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,060
但我觉得
but I think Rachel should 

442
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,650
应该让瑞秋来负责助理们
handle the associates for right now.

443
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,360
-你在开玩笑吗  -不  我没有
- Is that a joke? - No, it's not.

444
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,160
那我来解释下
Well, then let me explain

445
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,790
什么叫所谓的地位
a little something to you called pecking order.

446
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,090
我在这里  瑞秋在这里
See, I am up here. Rachel's down here.

447
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,250
你不能让处于这种低位置的人
And you don't give dominion over your associates

448
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,400
来管理助理
to someone down here. 

449
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,720
我知道  但我还知道
I know that, but I also know that 

450
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,030
塔拉昨晚和你分手了
Tara broke up with you last night,

451
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,040
所以你现在不在状态
and you're not in your right mind.

452
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,060
我不想再听到这个名字了
I don't want to hear that name again.

453
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,880
路易  我想说的是如果你解决此事
Louis, all I'm saying is if you don't deal with it,

454
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,750
你会一直虐待助理们
you're gonna keep abusing the associates,

455
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,410
-他们将会...  -唐娜  我告诉你
- and then we're gonna have-- - Hey, Donna, you know what,

456
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,470
我本来不想这么做
I didn't want to do this, 

457
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,730
但刚才我没有提这件事
but I did leave one name off the chart.

458
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,160
我  瑞秋  你
Me. Rachel. You.

459
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,600
所以你也没资格告诉我我该怎么做
So don't you tell me what to do.

460
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,250
路易  我就不揪着你这句话了
Louis, I'm gonna let that go, 

461
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,930
因为我知道你现在很受伤
because I know you're hurting,

462
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,250
但是恰恰证明我说的是对的
but that right there is exactly why I'm right,

463
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,840
因为如果你跟我都这么说话
because if you're willing to talk to me like that,

464
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,650
那你对助理们的态度真的要惨不忍睹了
God help those associates.

465
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,440
-喂  -是感觉良好医生吗
- Hello? - Yes, is this Dr. Feelgood?

466
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,810
我想预约一次谈话
'Cause I'd like to schedule an appointment 

467
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,800
越快越好
as soon as possible.

468
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,070
抱歉  你打错电话了
I'm sorry. You've got the wrong number.

469
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,360
我是我有正事要做医生
This is Dr. I Have Work to Do.

470
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,540
既然这样  我想预约一次谈话
Well, in that case, I'd like to schedule an appointment

471
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,410
越快越好
as soon as possible.

472
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,320
哈维  你到底为什么给我打电话
Harvey, why exactly are you calling me?

473
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,650
首先  先回答我
First, answer me this: 

474
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,010
自从你答应我之后
how many times have you considered 

475
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,380
几次想要拿起电话
picking up the phone and telling me that 

476
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,850
告诉我你后悔了
you've reconsidered since you said yes? 

477
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,820
四次  如果不算现在这次的话
Four. If you don't count right now.

478
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,560
这么说吧  我打给你的原因是
Then let's just say I'm calling to tell you

479
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,580
我刚刚和一屋子模特待了一个小时
that I've been in a room full of models for the last hour, 

480
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,840
然而我脑海里想的都是你
and all I can think of is you.

481
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,210
还在考虑拒绝我吗
Still thinking of cancelling on me?

482
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,820
不  哈维
No, Harvey.

483
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,420
我也期待我们的晚餐
I'm looking forward to our dinner as well.

484
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,690
你是不是把我们的婚礼日子提前了
Did you move up the date of our wedding

485
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,380
还忘了告诉我
and forget to tell me?

486
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,590
不是  我打扮成这样是因为
No, I got to get dressed up for this thing

487
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,650
我和哈维要去见个客户
that Harvey and I are going to for a client.

488
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,680
为了一位客户打扮
A thing for a client.

489
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,720
说的一点都不特别
That's not very specific.

490
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,970
我的意思是  这事不好解释
Uh, yeah, I mean, it's just kind of hard to explain.

491
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,570
这事是不是和三十六名模特
Hmm, does it involve three dozen models

492
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,460
加一堆伏特加有关
and 1,000 bottles of vodka?

493
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,720
看来也不没那么难解释
I guess it's not that hard to explain.

494
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,800
你打算什么时候告诉我
When were you gonna tell me?

495
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,550
如果不是提前说  那肯定是之后说
If not before, then definitely after...

496
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,830
或者根本不说  不太好说
or never. It's hard to tell.

497
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,700
我还没认真想过
I haven't really thought this through.

498
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,430
-你知道我在开玩笑  对吧  -是的
- You know I'm kidding, right? - Yes.

499
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,500
-你也应该来  -我去不了
- You should come. - I can't.

500
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,850
我和卡特里娜忙着帮齐本德尔剧团上市
Katrina and I are taking the Chippendales public,

501
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,710
我们要去见几位他们那里的首席舞者
so we're gonna meet with a few of their top dancers

502
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,170
做一些文书工作  估计要忙一晚上
to go over some paperwork. Probably take all night.

503
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,400
-一点意思都没有  -是的  没有
- So that's not funny. - Yes, it is.

504
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,290
我认真的  瑞秋  你应该一起去
I'm serious, Rachel, you should come.

505
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,240
哈维好像搞了一架直升机
I think Harvey got a helicopter.

506
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,600
我们可以坐直升机环绕城市
We should take a ride around the city.

507
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,100
我去不了  你去吧
I can't. You go.

508
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,130
说来话长  短版本就是...
It's a long story. I ju--

509
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,850
我可能要接管所有助理
I might be taking over the associates,

510
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,230
果真能如此  我希望提前做好准备
and if I do, I just want to be prepared.

511
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,070
太棒了  瑞秋  但你这是说
Rachel, that's amazing, but are you telling me

512
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,130
路易真的愿意放手吗
that Louis is really ready to give that up?

513
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,270
那个就是长版本
That's the long story.

514
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,490
但是我晚一点会告诉你的
But I'll tell you about it later tonight.

515
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,810
-我可以留下  -不  你应该去...
- I can stay. - No, you should go--

516
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,640
太好了
Great, okay.

517
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,720
-我爱你  -我也爱你
- I love you. - I love you too.

518
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,750
唐娜  在你走之前  能和你说几句吗
Donna, before you leave, can I talk to you for a second?

519
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,610
又怎么了
What is it now? 

520
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,650
公司的咖啡滤纸不够了吗
We're running low on coffee filters? 

521
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,920
找不到糖了吗
Can't find the Sweet 'n Low?

522
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,180
还是路易终于因为太混蛋被告了
Or is Louis finally being sued for being an asshole?

523
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,750
你想告诉我发生了什么
You want to tell me what's going on,

524
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,390
还是你想一直继续
or you want to keep firing your pistol

525
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,070
攻击同盟
in the wrong direction?

526
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,630
抱歉  格蕾琴
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

527
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,950
我真的厌烦了大家总来找我解决问题
I am just sick and tired of being everyone's go-to

528
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,530
但我却得不到我想要的
and not getting what I ask for.

529
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,340
我不想让你觉得我漠不关心
I don't mean to sound insensitive,

530
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,220
但是你是企业秘书
but you're a corporate secretary.

531
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,670
你到底期望些什么
What exactly did you expect?

532
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,050
你真的想知道吗
You really want to know?

533
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,120
我问哈维要了上桌的资格
I asked Harvey for a seat at the table.

534
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,330
-什么桌子  -合伙人的桌子
- What table? - The partnership table.

535
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,870
怪不得他拒绝了你
No wonder he shot you down. 

536
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,990
他没有拒绝我
He didn't shoot me down.

537
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,120
他跟我说他要考虑一下
He told me he would think about it,

538
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,560
但还没答复  我都不知道他还会不会答复
but I haven't heard anything, and I don't know now if I will.

539
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,430
有个得到他注意的办法  是去他办公室
One way to get his attention is to go in there

540
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,570
拿起你给他的支票  然后撕掉
and take that check you gave him and rip it the hell up.

541
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,160
-什么支票  -你给他的入股公司
- What check? - The check you gave him

542
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,360
做合伙人的资金
for your partnership money. 

543
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,540
-你没给他是吗  -没有
- You didn't give him one, did you? - No.

544
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,220
红毛  我告诉你
Let me tell you something, Red.

545
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,880
你想要上桌儿
You want a seat at the table,

546
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,450
就得下点本儿
you got to put some skin in the game.

547
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,580
终于来了  哈维
There he is. Hey, Harvey,

548
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,780
这是个好主意
This was a great idea, huh?

549
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,610
-很高兴我想出了这个点字  -开心吗
- Glad I thought of it. - Are we having fun?

550
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,440
如果你觉得和一名叫斯维特拉娜的模特
If you call talking geopolitics

551
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,170
聊地缘政治学算开心
with a model named Svetlana fun,

552
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,450
那就没错  非常开心
then that would be a big, fat bowl of yes.

553
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,530
镇定  小老虎  酒保在倒酒了
Easy, tiger. The bartender's pouring doubles.

554
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,940
那你又是来干什么的
And what are you doing here?

555
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,210
我要再来一杯  我是让你小心别醉了
I'm having another drink. I said for you to be careful.

556
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,880
-我不会醉的  -好吧
- I can handle my liquor. - Okay.

557
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,670
我举了几根手指
How many fingers am I holding up?

558
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,290
你看不出来吧
You can't tell, can you?

559
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,330
谁说不会醉来着
Who can't handle my liquor now?

560
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,220
我想让你吃点东西  但不巧的是
I'd tell you to put food in your stomach, but unfortunately,

561
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,460
我只点了些
I only ordered enough 

562
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,270
用来装点门面的食物
to give the appearance of having food.

563
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,590
所以总的来说  你只想
So basically, you're just trying to get  

564
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,120
把这些家伙灌醉来让你哄抬标价
these guys hammered so you can drive up the bidding.

565
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,190
不  我说过了
No. I told you,

566
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,700
那些调戏模特的家伙都不是认真的
the guys hitting on the models aren't serious.

567
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,310
-现在我告诉你...  -那些想把
- Now I'm telling you... - That the guys

568
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,680
自己灌醉的家伙也不是认真的
who let themselves get drunk aren't serious,

569
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,140
也就是说那些没醉的
which means whoever's left are the bids

570
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,330
才是我们今晚要拿下的投标人
that we have in our hands at the end of the night.

571
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,890
你早就知道了  对吗
You knew it the whole time, didn't you?

572
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,240
不看看和你说话的是谁
Who do you think you're talking to?

573
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,590
好伙计
Good man.

574
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,020
有一个小问题
There's just one small problem.

575
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,450
如果  我一不小心成了那些
What if, by accident, I happen to be one of the people

576
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,830
灌醉自己的家伙怎么办
that let himself get too drunk?

577
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,570
你只管放开了喝
You just might as well keep drinking,

578
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,480
如果我们玩的不尽兴
'cause if we're not having fun, 

579
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,870
那何苦待在这里
what the hell are we doing here?

580
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,550
好极了  明白
Yes! Copy that.

581
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,040
斯维特拉娜
Svetlana...

582
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,220
你清楚这间办公室不会自己收拾好的  对吧
You know this office isn't gonna pack itself up, right?

583
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,510
还没收拾是因为我们其中之一
It's not packed because one of us

584
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,130
之前三小时一直在工作
has been at work for the last three hours.

585
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,810
另一个不过是为了昨晚的工作
The other one of us was sleeping off

586
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,210
好好睡了一觉
all the work he did last night.

587
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,390
你是说你伏特加喝的宿醉未醒
You mean you're hung over from all the vodka you drank?

588
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,290
没错  我就是这个意思
Yeah, that's what I just said.

589
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,030
我真不该请你回来
I never should have hired you back.

590
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,170
现在想解雇我已经晚了
Well, it's too late to fire me now.

591
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,250
是吗
Is it?

592
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,540
因为如果你对得起你的薪资
Because if you were worth your salary,

593
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,250
你会问我们找到几个投标人了
you'd ask how many bids we're sitting on.

594
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,000
没必要问  我有脑子
I don't have to ask, because I've got this.

595
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,940
访客名单上有500人
Guest list was 500,

596
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,470
有一半是冲着模特来的
and half of them came for the girls.

597
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,660
剩下的有一半没什么钱
Half of the other half don't have the capital,

598
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,350
其中有百分之六十醒来后
and 60% of the rest of them woke up

599
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,990
觉得他们并不想掺和酒业
realizing they don't want to work in the liquor business.

600
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,620
就算  我不确定
Take, I don't know, what,

601
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,200
最多47个来竞争
47 off the top for good measure?

602
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,890
最后我们能收到的也就三个竞价
Leaves us with three bids.

603
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,550
-唐娜跟你说了  对吗  -可能吧
- Donna told you, didn't she? - Probably.

604
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,180
她有没有让你过来做点什么
Did she bother telling you what we're doing now?

605
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,300
-不用她说  你可是哈维・斯佩克特
- She didn't have to, 'cause you're Harvey Specter.

606
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,830
你也就那一招  几年前已经传授给我了
You've got one trick, and you taught it to me years ago,

607
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,250
我们走吧
so let's go.

608
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,330
你知道我可不只一招  对吧
You know I have more than one trick, right?

609
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,660
不  我知道你以为是这样
No, I know you think you do,

610
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,060
但是新瓶里装的
but just because you put on a different costume

611
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,340
可不一定是新酒
doesn't make it a different trick.

612
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,670
好吧  你还是喝醉时比较讨喜
Yeah, I liked you better when you were drunk.

613
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,660
我喝醉时你也更讨喜
I liked you better when I was drunk too.

614
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,950
我不管他们怎么说  都是胡扯
I don't care what they say. This is bullshit,

615
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,360
我不想被耍的团团转
and I'm not gonna get played.

616
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,150
先生们  不好意思  我第一天上班
Gentlemen, we're so sorry. It's my first day.

617
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,570
很显然  我和哈维同一时间
Evidently, I booked the conference room

618
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,320
-订了这间会议室  -胡说
- at the same time as Harvey. - Bullshit.

619
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,590
你们以为我们不知道你们的打算吗
You think we don't know what's going on here?

620
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,640
你们订一间会议室是想逼我们出更高的价
You double booked the room to scare us into overbidding.

621
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,580
你说得对  我们早该想到
You're right. We should have known

622
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,100
像你们这些精明人士
a couple of smart guys like you

623
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,280
绝不会上这种愚蠢的当
would never fall for the banana in the tailpipe.

624
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,520
我们带你们来这里是因为
We brought you down here just because you were

625
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,770
只有你们两人出价一亿
the only two bidders who came in at 100 million,

626
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,520
所以现在  你们两个好好看看
so now, you have to look each other in the eye

627
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,670
旗鼓相当的对方
while you go head-to-head.

628
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,130
接下来会这样
So here's what's gonna happen:

629
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,380
你们有一次机会写下你们的最高竞价
you got one chance to write down your best bid.

630
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,170
赢家通吃  输家走人
Winner takes all, loser goes home.

631
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,500
我们15分钟后见
We'll be back in 15 minutes,

632
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,000
希望能看到更高的竞价
and we better see some more zeroes.

633
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,630
如果我们串通呢  就在这儿
What if we collude, right here?

634
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,320
你们最多能拿到一亿
Stick at 100 and you're shit out of luck?

635
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,550
顺便一说  这恰恰是
Which, by the way, is exactly why

636
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,270
你们不订一间会议室的原因
you don't double book a conference room.

637
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,670
这里只有一个问题
There's only one problem with that.

638
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,510
当我们说只有你们
When we said you two were 

639
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,160
出价一亿时
the only ones that came in at 100,

640
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,600
我们没说没人出更高的价
we didn't say there wasn't someone who put down more.

641
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,940
-阿克谢罗德  -没错
- Axelrod. - Bingo.

642
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,480
二次竞价20分钟前就来了
Second bid came in 20 minutes ago.

643
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,710
所以如果你们想串通的话  请便
So if you two want to collude, go right ahead,

644
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,810
但是你们最好出价远超过一亿
but it better be for a hell of a lot more than 100 million.

645
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,290
-进展如何  -这要看情况了
- How'd it go? - That depends.

646
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:24,040
-阿克谢罗德二次竞价是多少  -两亿
- What was Axelrod's second bid? - 200 million.

647
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,180
这样的话进展如何都不重要了
Well, then it doesn't really matter how it went,

648
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,300
因为不管这些小丑出价多少
because whatever those clowns come up with,

649
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
尼尔・斯蒂尔曼都会抱回大笔现金
Neil Stillman's walking away with a boatload of cash.

650
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,380
说到大笔现金...
Speaking of boatloads of cash...

651
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,450
这是张50万的支票
It's a check for half a million dollars.

652
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,700
我告诉过你我是真的想要
I told you I was serious about 

653
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,950
成为合伙人  我也真的是认真的
becoming a partner, and I am.

654
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,290
-唐娜...  -哈维  说实话
- Donna... - Harvey, be honest.

655
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,300
你还没考虑过我们
You haven't given one thought to 

656
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,420
昨天讨论过的事
what we talked about yesterday.

657
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,260
我最近有点忙
I've been a little busy.

658
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,770
你总想岔开这个话题
And you've also been avoiding the subject. 

659
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,740
这么一来  你就得认真对待了
This way, you have to take me seriously. 

660
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,260
我有认真对待此事
I do take you seriously.

661
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,750
那就去路易的办公室
Then walk the hell down to Louis' office

662
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,770
告诉他我要当合伙人
and tell him I'm a partner. 

663
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,100
唐娜  我不能把每个决定直接
Donna, I can't just ram every decision 

664
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,390
-通知给他  -每个决定
- down his throat. -Every decision?

665
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,820
你到现在还没告诉他你要坐上
You haven't even told him that you're stepping

666
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,140
杰西卡的位置
into Jessica's shoes yet.

667
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,360
我在等合适的时机
I'm waiting for the right time.

668
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,630
如果我是合伙人的话  我会告诉你
And if I were a partner, I would tell you that

669
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,440
-昨天就是绝佳时机  -唐娜... 
- the right time was yesterday. - Donna...

670
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,990
哈维  你觉得我在要你可怜我吗  我没有
Harvey, you think I'm asking for charity, I'm not.

671
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,680
我要你为我这些年做过的事
I am asking for you to make official

672
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,940
给我个交代
what I have been doing for years anyway,

673
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,780
也就是给你出谋划策  就像你需要
which is giving you advice, like you need to step

674
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,660
去告诉路易你是这儿的老大
the hell up and tell Louis that you're in charge,

675
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,780
现在  不管你接不接受
and right this second, you're either gonna take that advice,

676
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,670
这个建议  现在你应该
or you're not, but it is time

677
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,330
对我的工作
that you recognize me

678
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,440
予以认可了
for what I do.

679
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,520
我哥哥托马斯比我聪明
My brother Thomas is the clever one.

680
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,000
在剑桥教书
Teaches at Cambridge.

681
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,440
一周工作20小时  暑假休息
20 hours a week, summers off.

682
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,850
你没在听我说话  对吗
You're not listening to a word I'm saying, are you?

683
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,060
-我很抱歉  -你是该道歉
- I'm sorry. - Well, you should be.

684
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,280
大家都说我还挺招人喜欢的
I've been told I'm actually quite delightful.

685
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,060
你确实是  我只是有点分心了
You are. I'm just a little distracted.

686
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,690
开胃菜才吃了一半
Halfway through appetizers.

687
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,370
等到酒浸烧烤端上桌来
Doesn't bode very well for how you'll be feeling

688
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,220
-就不知道你会怎样了  -不是你想的那样
- when our flambé arrives. - It's not that.

689
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,070
杰西卡上个月离开了事务所
Jessica left the firm last month.

690
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,900
大家都认为我是继承人
Everyone assumes that I'm next in line,

691
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,770
而现在唐娜又来告诉我  如果我不快点
and now I've got Donna telling me that if I don't step up...

692
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,740
等等  我以为你有一天早上说过
Wait a second, I thought you told me as of the other morning

693
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,950
你现在已经是公司老大了
that you're now head of the firm.

694
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,720
确实是  只是我还没告诉路易
I am. I just haven't told Louis yet,

695
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,320
而唐娜逼着不放
and Donna won't let it go.

696
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,530
我觉得这次见面就是个错误
I think this may have been a mistake.

697
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,470
-什么  -你不是来和我约会的
- What? - You didn't come to me to date me, 

698
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,700
你来找我是因为你正处于另一场危机
you came to me because you're in the middle

699
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,070
而你需要我来帮你度过它
of another crisis and you need me to walk you through it.

700
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,720
才不是这样
That's not true.

701
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,790
你当然不这样想
Of course you don't think it's true.

702
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,140
如果你这样想  你就会给我办公室打电话
If you did, you would have called my office

703
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,320
-来预约治疗了  -我不需要预约
- and made an appointment. - I don't need an appointment.

704
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,300
我是要和你分享生活中的事情
I'm sharing things about my life.

705
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,640
据我所知  人们约会的时候就是这样做的
Last time I checked, that's what people do on dates.

706
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,120
这没错  哈维  但是第一次约会的时候
Yes, it's what they do, Harvey, but on first dates,

707
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,050
人们也会尽力让对方感觉到他们很特别
they also try to make the other person feel special

708
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,100
-而且有人愿意听他们说话  -宝拉
- and listened to. - Paula--

709
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,040
你知道为什么  心理医生与客户约会
Do you know why it's unethical for a therapist

710
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,400
是违反职业道德的吗  哈维
to go out with her client, Harvey?

711
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,530
当然知道了
Yeah, of course I do.

712
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,630
因为客户会自然而然地
It's because it's natural for a client

713
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,030
将不真实的情感和爱意
to transfer feelings of desire

714
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,720
转移到心理医生身上
onto his therapist that aren't real.

715
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,350
-我知道这一点  -但你不知道的是
- I know that. - What you may not know

716
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,790
心理医生有这样的移情
is that it's not unnatural

717
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,280
也是再正常不过的
for a therapist to feel the same way.

718
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,260
你以为我对你就没抱过幻想吗
You don't think I've had fantasies about you?

719
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,120
幻想着有一天  当我晚上准备回家的时候
That one day you'd show up at my office

720
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,480
你会出现在我的办公室
as I was heading home for the night,

721
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,890
我一转头就会看见你
and I turn around, and you'd be there.

722
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,000
你什么都不说
You wouldn't say a word, but...

723
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,690
把我拥入怀中  开始吻我
you'd take me in your arms and kiss me, and...

724
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,640
而那将是一段特别的感情的开端
it would actually be the start of something special.

725
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,650
我有过这些幻想
Well, I have,

726
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,050
所以  虽然我有更好的判断力
which is why despite my better judgment,

727
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,340
我还是来和你约会了
I'm here with you right now.

728
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,200
-所以说问题在哪  -问题是在这些幻想中
- So what's the problem? - The problem is those fantasies

729
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,750
我不应该是你的心理医生
weren't of me being a therapist to a man

730
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,090
而你害怕到不敢承认自己需要帮助
who's still too afraid to admit that he needs help,

731
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,740
更别说是掌控一家以你冠名的事务所了
much less take control of a firm that bears his name.

732
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,270
谢谢你的晚餐  哈维
Thank you for dinner, Harvey.

733
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,470
如果你需要治疗  请给我办公室打电话
If you need a session, call my office.

734
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,470
遗憾的是  我不能再当你的治疗师了
Unfortunately, I can't see you anymore,

735
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,260
但我可以给你推荐一些
but I can give you a recommendation

736
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,410
可能的人选
for someone who can.

737
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,920
-路易  我能做什么  -为我吗
- Louis, what can I do-- - Do for me?

738
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
你可以告诉我  今后你对我再有什么不满
You could tell me from now on if you have a problem with me,

739
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,550
你可以和我当面说  别在我背后捣鼓
you'll take it up with me instead of going behind my back.

740
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,460
-什么  -这就对了
- What? - That's right.

741
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,600
你以为我不知道这件事吗
You think I don't know the whole

742
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,440
"瑞秋应该负责我的助理律师"这种狗屁
"Rachel should be in charge of my associates"

743
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,360
是你说的  而不是唐娜
bullshit came from you and not Donna?

744
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,510
没错  是我说的
You're right. It was from me.

745
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,270
我最先来找的你  而你把我凶惨了
And I came to you first, and you bit my head off.

746
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,000
那我就换种
Well, then let me tell you in a way

747
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,360
不会伤害你这小可人的方式来说
that won't harm your pretty little head,

748
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,670
我都忘了你有多娇贵了
because I clearly forgot what a delicate little flower you are.

749
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,380
这些助理都是我的
Those associates are mine,

750
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,880
除非等我死了那天  你来从我手里撬走
and the only way you're ever gonna get them

751
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,740
否则你永远别想拿到
is if you pry them from my cold, dead hands.

752
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,580
唐娜  除非是紧急情况
Donna, unless it's an emergency--

753
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,680
这就是紧急情况
It is an emergency.

754
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,620
我需要知道我的事你办得怎么样了  哈维
Harvey, I need to know what you're doing about me.

755
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,790
唐娜  现在时机不对
Donna, right this second is not the time.

756
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,320
时机正对  要是没人尽快
It is the time, because if somebody doesn't

757
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,260
对路易采取行动
do something about Louis soon,

758
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,120
事务所就要被自己的助理起诉了
this firm is gonna end up being sued by our own associates.

759
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
我没有权限做什么
I don't have the authority to do anything,

760
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,060
而你都不知道我说的是怎么回事
and you don't even know what I'm talking about.

761
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,780
好吧  唐娜
Okay, Donna.

762
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,140
你赢了  你是合伙人了
You win. You're a partner.

763
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,480
哈维
Harvey.

764
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,390
我们有麻烦了
We got a problem.

765
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,200
这次又是什么
What is it now?

766
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,320
你看一下
Take a look.

767
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,930
你是从哪儿拿到的
Where'd you get this?

768
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,010
我从哪拿到的不是重点
It doesn't matter where I got it.

769
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:24,960
重点是文件已经传出来了
It's out there.

770
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,130
你又不能确定尼尔知道
You can't be sure Neil knew this.

771
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,150
这有什么区别吗
What difference does that make?

772
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,480
因为如果他不知道的话
Because if he didn't know,

773
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,140
-就只是倒霉了  -哈维  他可是首席执行官
- it's just bad luck. - Harvey, he's the goddamn CEO.

774
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,760
他知道  他瞒着我们
He knew. He kept it from us,

775
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,370
而且他还瞒着那些收购他公司的人
and he kept it from the guys buying his company.

776
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,030
-这你可不知道  -我知道的
- You don't know that. - Yes, I do.

777
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,620
我也知道你还有时间去阻止
I also know you still have time to go stop 

778
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,470
-这次收购  -你是在开玩笑吧
- this sale from going through. - Are you kidding?

779
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,810
文件已经签了  收购已经完成了
They signed the documents. It's already gone through.

780
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,300
款项还没转手
Money hasn't changed hands yet,

781
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,100
所以你还有时间
so you still have time to stop it.

782
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,950
-迈克  -哈维  如果你不过去
- Mike-- - Harvey, if you don't get over there 

783
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,290
-在转手之前找到  -好了  我会处理的
- and find out before-- - All right. I'll handle it.

784
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,060
-你要去哪儿  -我要和路易谈谈
- And where are you going? - I need to talk to Louis.

785
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,040
不管是什么事  都要等到明天
Whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait until tomorrow,

786
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,250
因为如果你不在钱款转手前
because if you don't get over there

787
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,690
赶到那里
before that money changes hands,

788
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,280
那就是置我们于各种危险之前了
you are opening us up to a shitload of trouble.

789
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,370
这里晚上有点吓人  是吧
Kind of creepy in here at night, isn't it?

790
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,700
还好吧  我倒觉得挺平静的
Oh, I don't know. I find it kind of peaceful.

791
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,940
那干嘛要卖掉它  而且最重要的
Then why get rid of it? And more importantly,

792
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,200
你为什么想要交易这么快就完成
why'd you need the sale to go through so quickly?

793
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,940
我说过  我有个收购机会
I told you, I have another opportunity.

794
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,860
如果要我说  真正的原因是
And what if I said the real reason was

795
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,060
你知道你的伏特加生意要被起诉了
you knew you vodka business was about to be sued

796
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,970
因为你用了另一个品牌的配方
for using another brand's recipe?

797
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,980
而我会说我不知道这些
I would say I did not know that.

798
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,430
-而你其实知道  -又不能改变什么
- Well, now you do. - It doesn't change a thing.

799
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,940
那两个笨蛋已经签了合同
Those two dipshits already signed the agreement.

800
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,350
尼尔  这看着就像是你要我
Neil, this looks a hell of a lot like you're asking me

801
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,540
-跟你合伙诈骗  -我是要你做好本职工作
- to be a party to fraud. - I'm asking you to do your job.

802
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,900
为我谋取利益  相信我说的话
Look out for my interests, and take me at my word.

803
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,030
如果我有理由相信你在说谎  而我确实相信...
If I have reason to believe that you're lying to me, which I do-- 

804
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,360
唯一一件你要相信的事是
The only thing you have

805
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,620
如果你不这样做  我就会炒了你
reason to believe is that I will fire you

806
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,570
如果你不答应我  我会另找他人
if you don't do this for me and then find someone who will,

807
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,470
没有你地球照样转
so this thing is gonna get done whether you do it or not.

808
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,260
唯一确定的是如果你不答应
The only thing that happens if you don't

809
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,530
外界会坚定此前的风言风语
is that the world will know what people suspect already:

810
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,280
也就是你无法代替杰西卡
that you can't fill Jessica's shoes.

811
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,420
如此一来你认为多长时间
How long do you think it's gonna take after that

812
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,250
你的每位客户会开始离你而去
before every one of your clients starts to leave you?

813
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,640
所以现在告诉我答案
So you tell me right now,

814
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,910
你加入还是退出
are you in or not?

815
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,230
见鬼  奥利佛
Shit. Oliver.

816
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,560
最近怎样  迈克
What's up, Mike?

817
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,260
-新工作还好吗  -我很抱歉
- How's your new job? - I'm sorry.

818
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,430
我发誓我准备告诉你的
I swear I was gonna tell you.

819
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,600
是啊  我听说了
Yeah, I heard,

820
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,230
但我想你的确往前走了  对吗
but I guess when you move on, you move on, right?

821
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,250
拜托  不是这样的
Come on, it's not like that.

822
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,480
胡扯  不是这样的
Bullshit, it's not like that.

823
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,470
你离开了  迈克  扔下此前一切承诺
You left, Mike, after everything you said.

824
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,350
你能让我解释下吗
Would you please just let me explain?

825
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,100
我曾竭力为你挽回那份工作
I fought for your goddamn job.

826
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,270
我明白  我会永远心存感激
I know that, and I will always be grateful for it,

827
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:44,710
但实不相瞒
but I am telling you,

828
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,060
现在这样更好  因为...
it's better this way, because--

829
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,920
对谁更好  因为你不得不挣钱
Better for who? Based on that extra cash

830
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,500
向纳森上交罚金吗
that you had to throw at Nathan?

831
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,010
照我说这是为你自己好
I'd say it's better for you.

832
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,950
对每个人都好
For everybody.

833
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,960
我还是可以帮法律诊所处理案子
I can still have cases with the clinic.

834
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,440
我们还能一起工作
You and I can still work together.

835
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:55,920
我真幸运
Lucky me.

836
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,520
奥利佛  我回来的唯一原因是
Oliver, the only reason I went back

837
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,620
哈维承诺会做公益法律服务
is that Harvey committed to doing pro bonos, all right?

838
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,990
我处理的一半案子
Half of my cases,

839
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,730
和我在诊所时做的一样  只是这一次
the kind the clinic does, only this time,

840
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,990
我们有大律所的资源支持
with the resources of a big firm behind us.

841
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,950
是吗  那你现在手头是什么工作  迈克
Oh, really? What are you working on right now, Mike?

842
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,510
什么
What?

843
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,750
你回来后做的第一件事是什么
What's your first case back?

844
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,400
关于土地征用权还是侵犯公民权
Eminent domain? Civil rights violation?

845
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,280
奥利佛  别这样
Oliver, come on,

846
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,200
不是这样的  告诉我你回来的第一件事
It's not that-- - Tell me your first case back

847
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,360
如果不是为公司权贵端茶倒水
isn't carrying water for some corporate big shot,

848
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,150
我就马上闭嘴
and I'll shut my mouth right now.

849
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,330
玛莉莎说对了
Marissa was right.

850
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:25,110
你和我们共事只是为了等待时机
All you were doing with us was biding your time.

851
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,190
-这怎么回事  -你说什么
- What the fu-- is going on? - What do you mean?

852
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,170
案子结束了  你说过你会进行下一步
Case is over. You said you'd move.

853
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,760
我只是在推动进度
I'm just getting the ball rolling.

854
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,310
我如果没有自己的办公室无法处理案件
I can't work on my own cases if I don't have my own office.

855
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:49,930
听着  迈克
Listen, Mike.

856
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,640
你让那笔交易继续了
You let the goddamn sale go through.

857
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,690
-你不明白  -我不明白你说过
- You don't understand. - I understand that you said

858
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,420
你想在上位前和我最后一起做一个案子
that you wanted one last case together before you stepped up,

859
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,780
但你明显还未准备好要做领导
but you clearly are not ready to step up,

860
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,230
所以我得在这件律所消失之前
so I got to get my pro bono cases in

861
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,500
多花点时间处理我的公益案件
before this place doesn't even exist anymore.

862
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,220
你说完了吗  有空听我说说
Are you finished, or do you have a minute to hear

863
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,530
为什么我继续了交易吗
why I let the sale go through?

864
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,710
不  我不在乎
Oh, no, I don't care.

865
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,780
迈克  他知道我没有证据
Mike, I have no proof he knew.

866
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,500
他是杰西卡的委托人
He's Jessica's client.

867
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,350
如果他把我们再也无法处理他事务的事
How's it gonna look if he tells the world

868
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,780
公诸于众  会怎么样
that we can't handle his business anymore?

869
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,380
我现在告诉你会怎么样
Well, I'll tell you how it looks right now.

870
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,860
看起来你在害怕  而且说了不算
It looks like you're afraid and you're not in charge.

871
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,750
好吧  你要是这样跟我说话
Okay, you say something like that to me,

872
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,060
你最好做好挨揍的准备
you better get ready for a hit,

873
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,870
因为我一直在尽力而为
because I am doing the best I can.

874
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,750
不  哈维  你什么都没做
No, Harvey, you're not doing shit.

875
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,350
你在逃避  因为你害怕
You're hiding, 'cause you're afraid.

876
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,160
你害怕挑起这件律所的担子
You're afraid to take responsibility for this firm,

877
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,820
你也不会对自己承认这一点
and you won't admit it to yourself.

878
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,780
我不必听这些
I don't have to listen to this.

879
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,150
你必须听
Well, you're going to,

880
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,800
因为回想以前  你出于关心
'cause way back when, you cared enough about me

881
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,370
当着我的面说出了同样的话
to tell me the same thing to my face,

882
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,180
我现在只是在投桃报李
and I'm just returning the favor.

883
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,760
我不是她  迈克
I'm not her, Mike.

884
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,030
-我不是她  -你不必成为她
- I'm not her. - You don't have to be her.

885
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,950
你只用做回你自己
You just have to go back to being you.

886
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,290
我们第一次见面  聘用我的那个哈维
The Harvey I met the day you hired me,

887
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,010
他会走到尼尔・斯蒂尔曼面前
he would have gone in there and told Neil Stillman

888
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,640
告诉他去他妈的
to go fu-- himself.

889
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,780
所以由你决定
So it's up to you.

890
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,260
你可以继续躲在杰西卡阴影之下
You can keep hiding out in Jessica's shadow,

891
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,760
也可以走出阴影
or you get out of it

892
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,510
做一个霸道的哈维・斯佩克特
and start being Harvey goddamn Specter.

893
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,030
你也发现这里白天特别平静是吗
Do you find it peaceful here in the day too?

894
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,410
你带了我的支票过来
You're here to bring me my check,

895
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,080
那我的答案是肯定的
then the answer's yes.

896
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,330
我来这里告诉你我们终止了出售
I'm here to tell you that we stopped the sale.

897
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,690
你刚才说什么
What did you just say?

898
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,110
我们不参与你的骗局
We're not taking part in your fraud

899
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,190
所以你可以关掉你的烂公司了
so that you can dump your shitty company.

900
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,610
你这个混蛋  我不记得我给过你选项
You son of a bitch, I don't remember giving you a choice.

901
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,800
你给了  因为你的原话是
Well, you did, because your exact words were,

902
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,400
"要么同意  要么被解雇"
"Do it, or you're fired."

903
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,540
那你他妈被解雇了
Then you're goddamn fired.

904
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,760
你可以解雇我们  但一旦被解雇
You can let us go if you want, but the second you do,

905
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,250
我们会发一篇通讯稿声明
we're putting out a press release saying

906
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,850
皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特不再代理
Pearson Specter Litt no longer represents clients

907
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:06,420
我们认为资产剥离中有不道德行为的委托人
we feel are unethical in their divestiture practices.

908
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,090
你不能这么做
You can't do that,

909
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,980
这触犯了律师-委托人的保密特权
that's attorney-client privilege.

910
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,680
不  因为我们不会对你指名点姓
No, it's not, because we're not gonna name you.

911
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,350
但你用屁股想都能猜到
But you can bet your ass the whole world

912
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,310
全世界都会知道我们说的是谁
is gonna know who we're talking about.

913
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,810
你想要什么
What do you want from me?

914
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,300
你是作为我的委托人在询问我吗
Are you asking me as my client?

915
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,210
因为我不提供免费法律建议
Because I don't give free legal advice.

916
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,700
是的  好吧  你还是我的律师
Yes, okay. You're still my attorney.

917
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,950
这样的话  接下来要做的是
In that case, here's what's gonna happen:

918
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,240
你去和你盗用配方的对象
you're gonna go into business

919
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,220
做一笔交易
with the guys whose process you stole.

920
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,610
你私下交给他们10%的公司股权
You're gonna quietly give them 10% of your company,

921
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,030
把商品售价提高两倍
you're gonna triple your price, and you're gonna have

922
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,860
两家公司就谁家的伏特加味道更好进行公开竞争
a very public feud over whose vodka tastes better.

923
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,080
然后在这相同产品的两大品牌间的战争中
And then we both profit from a war

924
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,310
我们均能从中获利
between two brands that have the exact same product.

925
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,440
达成双赢
Win-win.

926
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,270
或许你和杰西卡一样厉害
Maybe you are as good as Jessica.

927
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,210
或许是  或许不是
Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not.

928
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,640
但我和她的共识是
But the thing we have in common is

929
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,340
我们再也不会受任何委托人的摆布
we're never gonna be bullied by any of our clients.

930
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,600
好了  路易  我一直尽力做到通情达理
All right, Louis, I've tried to be reasonable,

931
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,860
但我不会再坐视不管
but I'm not gonna sit around and watch this anymore.

932
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,970
从现在起  你不再
As of this moment, you're no longer

933
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,390
-负责管理新律师  -这是你和谁的意思
- in charge of the associates. - Says you and what army?

934
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,590
抱歉  我没听懂
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

935
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,850
-我说你做不到  -不  我可以
- I said you can't do that. - Oh, yes, I can,

936
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,660
因为即使哈维明显还未告诉你
because even though Harvey clearly didn't tell you,

937
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,640
从昨晚开始  我成为了高级合伙人
as of last night, I'm a senior partner.

938
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,790
-你成为什么  -你没听错
- You're what? - That's right.

939
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,780
我给了哈维一张五十万美元的支票
I gave Harvey a check for half a million dollars.

940
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,340
我现在是高级合伙人  路易
I'm a partner now, Louis,

941
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,980
这意味着你那套
which means your whole

942
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,570
"你高高在上  我俯首称臣"的屁话
"You're up here and I'm down here" bullshit,

943
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,620
行不通了
not anymore.

944
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,300
合伙人
Partner?

945
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,310
你甚至都不是律师
You're not even a lawyer.

946
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,320
世界最顶尖的9家律所中  有4家的首席运营官
Neither are the Chief Operating Officers of four

947
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,090
也都不是律师
of the top nine firms in the world.

948
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,150
这简直是胡闹  我根本没同意
This is bullshit. I didn't agree to any of this.

949
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,920
我不管你同意还是不同意
I don't care whether you agreed to it or not.

950
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,970
你都得忍着
You're gonna live with it.

951
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,430
我也不管你的头衔是什么
And I don't give a shit what your supposed title is.

952
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,840
我是不会放手我的律师的
I'm not giving up my associates.

953
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,610
如果你觉得你可以就这样离开这间洗手间
And if you think you're gonna leave this bathroom

954
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,520
而不对我表示出我应得的尊重...
without giving me the respect I deserve--

955
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,170
我是不会放手我的律师的
I'm not giving up my associates.

956
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,040
够了
That's enough. 

957
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,950
哈维  你这做的是什么狗屁决定
Harvey, what the hell kind of shit did you pull?

958
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,290
闭嘴听我说  路易
Shut up and listen, Louis.

959
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,890
唐娜要求在管理层有一席之位
Donna asked for a seat at the table,

960
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,160
而我同意了
and I gave her one,

961
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,680
因为先前为我工作时  她一直支持着我
because when she worked for me, she had my back,

962
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,680
愿意为我大杀四方
and would kill anyone coming for me,

963
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,320
而她先前为你工作时  一样尽心尽力
and when she worked for you, she did the same exact thing,

964
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,170
更别提如果她离开了
not to mention if she left tomorrow,

965
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,680
这家律所15分钟之内就会变为一滩散沙
this firm would be a pile of rubble within 15 minutes.

966
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,190
那就给她加薪啊
So then give her a raise.

967
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,050
但你不能就这样把她抬为高级合伙人
You don't make her goddamn senior partner.

968
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,610
假如杰西卡在  她也会和我做法一样的
If Jessica were here, she'd tell you to do the same exact thing.

969
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,450
但是  路易  杰西卡不在了
Well, Louis, Jessica isn't here,

970
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,250
但我在
but I am.

971
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,980
-谢谢你  哈维  -先别急着谢我
- Thank you, Harvey. - Don't thank me yet.

972
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,150
你要求大家投票表决  没问题
You asked for a vote. You got it.

973
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,960
但决定什么时候发起投票的人是我
But the person who's gonna decide when that vote is is me,

974
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,420
而我认为我们要做的第一件事
and I say our first order of business

975
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,770
是对外公布哈维・斯佩克特是新的管理合伙人
is putting out word that Harvey Specter is the new managing partner.

976
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,210
你们想对这个决定投票表决吗  来吧
Now, you want to vote on that? Let's do it.

977
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,910
但假如我们不能达成一致
But if it's not unanimous,

978
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,210
那就有大麻烦了
we're gonna have a big problem.

979
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,790
我没意见
No problem here.

980
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,220
你呢  路易
What about you, Louis?

981
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,410
你对我当老大有意见吗
You got a problem with me calling the shots?

982
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,940
没有  哈维
No, Harvey.

983
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,300
没意见  管理合伙人是你
No problem. You're managing partner.

984
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,280
很好  那我建议你们两个
Good. Then I suggest the two of you 

985
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,710
在明天之前收拾好心情
get your shit together before tomorrow,

986
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,080
因为此时此刻  我还有事要忙
because right now, I've got some things to take care of.

987
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,360
我现在不想理你  路易...
I don't want to talk to you right now, Louis--

988
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,780
我想让你来接手那些律师
I want you to have the associates.

989
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,810
无论你对唐娜说了什么  你都没说错
Whatever you said to Donna, you were right.

990
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,440
-路易...  -瑞秋  让我说完
- Louis... - Rachel, just let me finish

991
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,810
趁着我还能说得出口
while I'm still able to get it out.

992
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,620
我知道我对他们是严厉了点...
I know I can be rough on them...

993
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,740
但那只是因为我希望看到他们
but it's only because I want to see them

994
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,700
成为他们能成为的最好的律师
become the best lawyers they can be.

995
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,130
但如今我不在最佳状态
But I'm not in the best headspace right now,

996
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,170
我如果一直把气撒在他们头上
and if I keep taking my anger out on them,

997
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,000
他们是无法成为伟大的律师的
they will not become great lawyers.

998
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,620
说不定他们都要直接退出法律界了  所以...
They might not stay in the law at all, so...

999
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,060
最好还是有别人暂时来接手一下
it's better that someone else takes over for a while,

1000
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,150
而我想不到比你更合适的人选了
and I cannot think of a better person than you.

1001
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,820
很抱歉我背着你行事了  路易
I'm sorry that I went behind your back, Louis.

1002
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,910
你没做错
You were right to.

1003
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,380
如果你当着我的面提出
If you had asked me face-to-face,

1004
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,870
我都不知道我会做出什么
I don't even know what I would have done,

1005
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,960
那种场景...光是想想都让我不舒服了
and that--just thinking about that makes me sick.

1006
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,170
瑞秋  你就像是我的亲人
Rachel, you're family,

1007
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,280
假如我连你都失去了...
and if I lose you too...

1008
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,510
路易  你不会失去我的
Louis, you're not going to lose me,

1009
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,860
但我觉得我知道你可能需要些什么
but I think I know what you may need.

1010
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,100
你可千万别说是"假期"
Please don't say vacation.

1011
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,280
如果再来一个人和我提玛莎葡萄园岛
If someone else mentions Martha's Vineyard one more time,

1012
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,970
-我对天发誓...  -我想说的词是"终结"
- I swear to God... - I was gonna say closure.

1013
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,620
假如你是想说我得去和塔拉谈谈...
If you're telling me that I need to talk to Tara--

1014
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,940
路易  你本来都要结婚了
Louis, you were gonna get married.

1015
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,780
你本来都要当父亲了
You were gonna be a father.

1016
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,770
不能仅凭一通语音留言就结束这一切
That can't all end over a voicemail.

1017
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,800
好好对他们
Treat them well.

1018
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,140
我就知道
I knew it. 

1019
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,020
知道什么
Knew what?

1020
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,120
你没种把哈维的旧办公室填满
You don't have the balls to fill Harvey's office.

1021
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,060
好吧  唐娜  声明一下
Okay, Donna, just to be clear,

1022
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,630
光看种可算不得男人
balls do not make the man.

1023
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,130
-瑞秋可不是这么说的  -这话是什么意思
- That's not what Rachel says. - What does that even mean?

1024
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,570
我觉得咱俩都明白这是什么意思
I think we both know what that means.

1025
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,390
唐娜  和你声明一下
Donna, for the record,

1026
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,180
我的"种"尺寸正常
my balls are within normal parameters.

1027
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,740
所以你下来就是为了调侃我
So you just come down here to give me shit,

1028
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,230
还是说有其他什么事情
or was there maybe another reason?

1029
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,610
还能有什么事情
What other reason would I have?

1030
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,820
我一个都想不出来
I can't think of a single one.

1031
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,240
-那我来这里的任务就完成了  -很好
- Then my work here is done. - Good.

1032
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,230
因为我显然不是下来告诉你
Because I certainly didn't come down here to tell you

1033
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,220
我还记得你第一次进这间办公室的情景
I remember the first time you were in this office,

1034
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,410
而我从没想到我会有
and I never thought I'd see the day

1035
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,020
对你道喜的这一天  迈克
when I told you congratulations, Mike.

1036
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,430
这一切都是你应得的
You deserve it as your own.

1037
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,890
-谢谢你  唐娜  -不客气  迈克
- Thanks, Donna. - You're welcome, Mike.

1038
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,040
你确定你不一起吗
Are you sure you don't come with it?

1039
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,710
我是说  那边有张桌子
I mean, there is a desk right there

1040
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,470
上面可是真真切切写着你的名字的
that literally has your name on it.

1041
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,770
抱歉  我也希望我能来
Sorry, I wish I could,

1042
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,720
但实际上我也分到了一间新办公室
but I actually got a new office too.

1043
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,810
-真的吗  -必须得有一间
- You did? - Needed one,

1044
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,950
因为等到明天
because as of tomorrow,

1045
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:54,300
我就正式是这家律所最新一位高级合伙人了
I am officially the firm's newest senior partner.

1046
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,060
我勒个去  你是认真的吗
Holy shit. Are you serious?

1047
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,100
是的  而且从现在开始
Yes. And from now on,

1048
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,250
你得说"您是认真的吗  女士"
it's, "are you serious, ma'am?"

1049
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,460
-清楚了吗  小帅哥  -天啊
- Have you got that, pretty boy? - My God.

1050
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,470
哈维造出了一个怪物是吧
Harvey's created a monster, hasn't he?

1051
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,910
你无法想象
You have no idea.

1052
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,730
唐娜...
Donna...

1053
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,610
这也是你应得的
it's about time.

1054
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,740
喂  我知道我们一直没谈过
Hey. I know we haven't spoken,

1055
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,660
我们也没有好好地结束
and we didn't exactly leave things off well,

1056
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,120
但是...
but...

1057
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,990
我今天真的很需要见你一面
I just really need to see you tonight

1058
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,530
假如还有一丝可能的话
if at all possible.

1059
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,690
看来你终于做了投入了
Guess you got some skin in the game after all.

1060
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,270
确实  格蕾琴
Sure did, Gretchen.

1061
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:13,940
确实
Sure did.
