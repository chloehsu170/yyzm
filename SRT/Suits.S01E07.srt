1
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,180
天呐  对不起  你没事吧
Oh, god, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

2
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,420
就算你担心我会告诉别人
You know there are easier ways to kill me,

3
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,670
你在法学院入学考试做过枪手  也不用这样吧
if you're worried I'll rat you out for cheating on the LSATs.

4
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,290
什么  别这样  瑞秋
What? Come on, Rachel.

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,240
不可理喻
Unbelievable.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,050
瑞秋
Rachel!

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,280
瑞秋  别这样  我给你买杯新的吧
Rachel, come on, let me buy you a fresh cup.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,320
你是真打算去买
Are you actually gonna buy it this time,

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,260
还是打算去偷呢
or are you gonna steal it?

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,580
首先  我不偷东西  我只是替考
Okay, first of all, I don't steal, I cheat.

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,180
二者截然不同  而且我已经洗手不干了
There's a big difference. And I don't do it anymore.

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,460
很有力的辩词
Oh, great defense.

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,040
对不起  法官大人  虽然我杀了她
I'm sorry, your honor, I know that I murdered her,

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,030
但我保证以后不这么做了
but I promise I won't do it anymore.

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,450
我知道你为什么生气
Look, I understand why you're mad,

16
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,200
但我还是觉得你对我的看法有点不公平
but I still don't think you're being entirely fair.

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,440
不公平吗
Not fair?

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,330
不公平的是你屡次替考  帮别人拿到资格证
What's not fair is that you repeatedly help people skirt a system

19
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,900
我却因为这个考试而当不成律师
that stands in the way of me becoming a lawyer.

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,290
别一副正气凛然的样子
You know what? Why don't you give up the whole saint act,

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,950
你之所以能发现我替考
since the only reason you figured out I was cheating

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,940
还不是因为你自己想要作弊
is 'cause you were thinkin' about cheating yourself.

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,470
想要作弊和真的作弊
Thinking about cheating and actually doing it

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,680
是两码事  别偷换概念
are two very different things, Doctor Analogy.

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,490
等等  我是错过了什么天灾吗
Whoa! Wait, did I miss an apocalypse?

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,890
人都哪去了
Where is everyone?

27
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,750
对于你这种记忆力超群的人
You know, for someone with a freak brain,

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,380
竟然能忘了这么重要的事情
you manage to forget everything important.

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,820
跟我来  但是别跟我说话
Follow me, but don't talk to me.

30
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,250
不错  哈维
Not bad, Harvey.

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,810
布拉格酒店  盈利不到三年
The Prague hotel, in the black in less than three years,

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,420
首次公开募股就很成功
and a successful I.P.O.

33
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,080
谁说热情不是生产力
Who said passion wasn't productive?

34
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,110
怎么可能有人那么说呢
I don't know anyone that's ever said that.

35
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,140
琼斯  我有事问你
Jones, tell me something.

36
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,680
你在12个国家有30家酒店
You have 30 hotels in 12 different countries,

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,640
为什么你上周却一直待在
but you spent last week

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,630
丹尼尔・维加的里斯本度假村
in Daniel Vega's Lisbon Resort.

39
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,350
怎么了  就是去摸摸对手的底
What? Just, you know, checkin' out the competition.

40
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,150
这可不止是去看看情况吧
That was more than a fact-finding mission.

41
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,510
你在考虑并购
You're thinking merger.

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,350
你真的觉得我对你
Do you honestly believe that I'd do that

43
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,540
还会先斩后奏吗
without talking to you first?

44
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,750
-我知道你会的  -也许我已经这么干了
- I know you would. - Then perhaps I did.

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,570
琼斯  如果你想要并购
Jones, if you try to pursue a merger,

46
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,750
那你对于自己苦心经营的产业
you may not control what happens to your business

47
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,490
就没有那么多控制权了
that you built so passionately.

48
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,670
好吧  侦探先生  你听我说
Okay, Sherlock, hear me out.

49
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,530
合并后我们就在23个国家有100百家酒店
Combined, we're 100 hotels in 23 countries.

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,860
我喜欢多几个地方落脚
I like having multiple homes.

51
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,830
但你不需要另一个人跟你一起还贷款
But you don't need another name on the mortgage.

52
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,860
这是桩不错的买卖 
It's a good deal.

53
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,070
是啊  而我的职责是帮你谈桩更好的买卖
Yeah, and it's my job to get you a better one, okay?

54
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,040
答应我先不要达成协议
Promise me you didn't do a handshake deal.

55
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,860
唐娜
Donna!

56
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,880
2011年模拟庭审现在开始
Who's ready for mock trial 2011?

57
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,010
就像假装的庭审吗
What, like make-believe trials?

58
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,690
我们接下来是不是要玩大富翁了
We gonna play Monopoly after?

59
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,610
这就相当于是你的社交新人舞会
This is your debutante ball.

60
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,790
你给合伙人的第一印象很重要
The impression you make on the partners will last.

61
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,230
让我猜猜  哈维当初...
And let me guess, Harvey was--

62
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,120
传奇人物啊
Oh, legendary.

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,070
太惊讶了
Shocking.

64
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,170
西德尼・汤普森曾是兰德斯全球联盟的顾问
Sydney Thompson was a consultant with Lunders Global Initiative.

65
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,480
她喝得有点高
She had a few too many,

66
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,770
决定用模仿她老板的方式
and decided to entertain her friends

67
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,630
来娱乐下她的朋友们
with an impersonation of her boss,

68
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,730
她老板是莉娜・兰德斯
Lena Lunders.

69
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,230
这次模仿被拍了下来
This impersonation was recorded

70
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,120
而且上传到了社交网站
and uploaded onto a social networking site.

71
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,820
第二天  她就被解雇了
The next day she was fired.

72
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,710
西德尼现在要起诉公司不正当解雇
Sydney is now suing for wrongful termination.

73
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,010
我们很期待看到你们在压力下的表现
We are looking to see how you do under pressure.

74
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,740
这次你可没法作弊了
Can't cheat your way out of this one.

75
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,850
规则规定  合伙人只有在紧急情况下
The partners have been instructed to only use the associates

76
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,690
才能使用助理律师
in emergency situations.

77
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,510
游戏开始吧
Let the games begin.

78
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,620
好啦  叫到你名字时  
All right. When your name is called,

79
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,560
请上前来认识下你的对手
please step up and meet your match.

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,800
你是说我的跟班吧  路易
I think you mean my bitch, Louis.

81
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,980
金・卡普兰
Gene Kaplan.

82
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,320
我很高兴杰西卡终于挑了个强势女性的案子
I'm glad Jessica finally chose a case with a strong female character.

83
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,060
去年我被迫要扮演交警
Last year I was forced to play a traffic cop.

84
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,870
乔瑟琳・劳恩斯坦
Jocelyn Lowenstein.

85
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,010
太浪费我的才能了
It was a total waste of my talent.

86
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,750
等等  你扮演了证人吗
Wait a minute, you play witnesses?

87
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,350
我不是扮演
Oh, I don't play anything.

88
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,840
我就是她的化身  
I embody.

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,900
如果我跟你一队  你赢定了
And if I'm on your team, you're a winner.

90
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,700
-这样的话...  -不行
- Well, in that case-- - No.

91
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,340
好吧
Okay.

92
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,220
迈克・罗斯
Mike Ross.

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,780
迈克・罗斯

94
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,340
迈克・罗斯
Mike Ross.

95
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,140
凯尔是原告律师
Kyle for the plaintiff.

96
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,820
罗斯是辩护律师
Ross for the defendant.

97
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,010
强者必胜  
May the best man win.

98
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,040
顺便说下  凯尔
Oh, by the way, Kyle,

99
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,200
你是不是全国模拟庭审冠军来着
weren't you, uh, National Mock Trial champion?

100
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,560
是啊  路易  从高中
That's right, Louis. In high school,

101
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,030
到大学  再到法学院  战无不胜
college, and law school.

第一季  第七集

114
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,310
我要一份对所有维加的酒店的评估
I need an assessment of all of Vega's hotels, okay?

115
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,430
我需要你去查下年收入
I want you to check annual earnings,

116
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,030
固定资产价值
property value.

117
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,450
-你应该写下来  -好的
- There should be writing. - Yeah.

118
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,790
这些听着不像是什么紧急情况
This all doesn't sound like an emergency.

119
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,990
模拟审判...  好吧
The mock trial-- Okay.

120
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,310
我这就去
I'm on it.

121
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,990
-对了  哈维  -我不会给你提建议
- Uh, listen, Harvey, about-- - I don't give advice.

122
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,940
好吧  求你了  老师
Okay, please, sensei?

123
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,320
我不太清楚这个事情
I'm out of my league with this thing.

124
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,890
听我说
Listen to me.

125
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,340
不要参加庭审
Don't go to trial.

126
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,030
这是次模拟庭审
It's a mock trial.

127
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,730
我觉得参加庭审算是先决条件吧
I think the trial part is kind of a prerequisite.

128
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,420
听着  法律讲究的是控制
All right. Law is about control, okay?

129
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,440
而你对于陪审团  法官  证人
You can only control so much with a jury, judge,

130
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,430
和有自我情节的对方律师的控制是有限的
witnesses, and another lawyer with an ego complex.

131
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,880
如果那律师没有自我情节呢
What if the lawyer doesn't have an ego complex?

132
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,780
每个律师都有自我情节
Every lawyer has an ego complex.

133
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,910
公司准备的这个练习
The firm has presented an exercise

134
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,030
有失败的可能性
where there's potential for failure, okay?

135
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,290
我的意思是  尝试去创造一个情景
All I'm saying is try and create a situation

136
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,190
让自己立于不败之地
where that's not even a possibility.

137

Koba--what now?

140
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,240
星际迷航  科克舰长
Star Trek. Captain Kirk.

141
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,000
他修改了规章制度得以反败为胜
He wins a no-win situation by rewriting the rules.

142
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,580
原来你爱看《星际迷航》啊  
You're a trekkie.

143
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,630
柯克船长是我的偶像
Hey, captain Kirk is the man,

144
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,090
没人能破坏他在我心中的形象
Okay? I don't wanna hear another word about it.

145
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,210
行了  你那个模拟庭审的问题到此为止
Now, enough with your fake law problem.

146
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,810
我有正经案子要处理  
Let's deal with my real one.

147
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,670
是  船长
Aye, captain.

148
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
你知道怎么做交叉询问吗
You wanna know how to do a cross?

149
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,320
有些人喜欢说大话
Some people like to use big words.

150
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,780
有些人爱打同情牌
Some people like to go for sympathy.

151
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,920
但就我个人而言
But personally,

152
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,230
我更喜欢直击要害
I'm a little more go for the groin.

153
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,340
迈克
Hey, Mike.

154
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,570
先让你的小帮派解散吧
You mind dismissing the peanut gallery

155
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,710
我有些话要对你说  凯尔  
so we can talk, Kyle?

156
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,880
抱歉  各位
I'm sorry, guys.

157
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,250
看样子罗斯来求饶了
Looks like Ross here came to plead for mercy.

158
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,250
如果你是想来和我交换人证物证的话
If you're here for the witness/exhibit exchange.

159
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,300
那就免了
Don't bother.

160
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,540
我已经知道你的人证是谁
I already know who you're gonna call

161
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,520
还有你会用到哪些物证
and what evidence you're gonna use.

162
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,560
其实  我不打算让任何证人出庭
Actually, I'm not gonna call any witnesses

163
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,030
也不想提交任何物证  我们和解吧
or present any evidence. Let's settle.

164
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,240
我赢定了
Or I can beat you.

165
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,900
证据已经显示原告对我的委托人
The plaintiff has shown a pattern of making

166
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,460
作出了一系列的诋毁性供述
derogatory statements about my client.

167
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,190
-道听途说  -这都在邮件里写着呢
- Hearsay. - Not the emails.

168
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,280
在邮件里就说明不是亲耳听到的
Which have no tone of voice

169
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,670
还会造成理解障碍
and are subject to interpretation.

170
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,990
所以你的论据是站不住脚的
Which is exactly why your argument is shaky at best.

171
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,450
-那就在法庭上打赢我吧  -凯尔
- Then beat me in court. - Kyle.

172
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,740
哈维选我当他的助理是有原因的
There's a reason that Harvey chose me to be his guy.

173
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,990
想知道为什么吗
Do you really wanna find out what that reason is?

174
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,850
我怎么知道你不是在耍花招呢
And how do I know this isn't some sort of trick?

175
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,110
这不是花招
It's not a trick.

176
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,580
这是我们大显身手的机会
This is our chance to stand out.

177
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,420
听着  如果和解的话
Look, settling gets us in and out of there

178
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,400
我们5分钟就能结案
in five minutes.

179
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,430
如果你撤诉  我们就可以利用剩下的时间
You drop the suit, and you and I spend the rest of the week

180
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,620
给合伙人们留下个深刻的印象
making ourselves indispensable to the partners

181
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,040
这时其他人还沉浸在模拟庭审的美梦里呢
while everyone else buries their heads in Candyland Court.

182
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,340
那我就违背自己的判断
I'm going against my better judgment

183
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,530
相信你一回
and trusting you.

184
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,810
那就这么说定了
So we have a deal.

185
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,400
丹尼尔  文书工作做得不错 
Daniel, paperwork looks good,

186
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,530
但你俩不准备请律师  这可不太好
despite the fact that you two decided to go lawyer commando.

187
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,410
细节决定成败啊
The devil's always in the details.

188
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,070
哈维  我知道仓促行事不是你的风格
Harvey, I know that impulse purchases don't exist in your world,

189
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,550
但现在时机到了
but the timing was right.

190
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,530
说到细节
And as for the details,

191
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,340
还是交给我的个人律师斯科特吧
I'd like to leave that to my man Scott.

192
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,580
他经常迟到吗
Does he always like to be late?

193
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,360
是"她"
She.

194
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,710
刚从伦敦飞过来
Just got off a plane from London.

195
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,910
来见一下达娜・斯科特
Meet Ms. Dana Scott.

196
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,380
欢迎
Welcome.

197
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,000
-你好  谢谢  -斯科特
- Hi. Thank you. - Scottie.

198
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,680
-哈维  -你们原来认识啊
- Harvey. - Oh, you two know each other!

199
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,020
我们是哈佛法学院的同学
We went to harvard law together.

200
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,590
哈维当时是班上第五名  而我是...
Harvey was fifth in the class, and I was--

201
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,860
我忘了  我是第几来着
Oh, I forget. What was it?

202
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,870
你那时嫁给图书馆了吧
Married to the library?

203
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,050
没错  我是第一名
That's right. Number one.

204
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,560
学习方面你确实是第一
Number one at studying.

205
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,270
好了  这边请
Okay, this way.

206
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,920
告诉我  斯科特
Tell me, Scottie,

207
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,450
当我们真正对峙公堂时
What's my success rate against you in the real world

208
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,040
我对你的胜率是多少
where we practice real law?

209
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,920
哈维  在并购案里不存在谁赢谁输
Harvey, there should be no winners or losers in a merger.

210
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,650
皆大欢喜
Just a happy new couple.

211
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,240
3比0  胜负一目了然
That's right, 3 and 0.

212
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,510
我们还是让他们谈谈公事
Well, I say we let these two talk deal points

213
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,530
我也去尝一尝你酒店主厨的拿手海鲈
While I try your chef's famous sea bass.

214
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,510
必须的  友谊第一
Absolutely. Play nice.

215
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,860
我们喜欢对方  但显然你们两个不是
We like each other, even if you two don't.

216
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,720
嫁给了图书馆
"Married to the library"?

217
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,670
又不是我的错
It's not my fault.

218
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,320
图书馆都是你能找到最好的了
Library was the best you could do.

219
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,190
你做好初步建议书了吗
Do you have the preliminary proposal?

220
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,700
没呢  我刚从伦敦飞过来  
No, I just flew in from London

221
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,900
毫无准备
completely unprepared.

222
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,120
别被吓到  我的用词比较晦涩
Try not to be intimidated. I use some big words.

223
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,150
"过度补偿"可算不上晦涩
Overcompensation isn't that big of a word.

224
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,630
不算吗
It isn't?

225
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,380
我很想见识下资深合伙人的水平
I can hardly wait to see the work of a senior partner.

226
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,900
看来我升职一事已经出现在
I see my promotion popped up

227
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,790
你的哈维・斯佩克特谷歌快讯上了
on your Harvey Specter Google Alert.

228
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,530
出现在我脑海里的可不止这一件事
That's not all that's going to pop up.

229
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,110
我们很久没在床上做了
Can't remember the last time we had a bed.

230
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,630
合作酒店并购案  这绝对是近水楼台
Pretty convenient that we're working on a hotel merger.

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,960
还记得那个采矿案吗
Remember the mining deal?

232
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,890
27号矿井那个案子吗  我怎么忘得了
Shaft 27? How could I forget?

233
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,770
听着  关于尽职审查...
Listen, about the due diligence--

234
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,180
哈维
Ah, Harvey.

235
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,030
你知道规矩的
You know the rules.

236
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,860
在完事前别跟我谈案子的事
No case negotiations till we're done.

237
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,180
我想那得有一会了
I think that might be a while.

238
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,460
忍不住想看我的精彩表现吧
Couldn't resist seeing brilliance in action, huh?

239
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,780
实际上  我必须出席
Actually, I have to be here.

240
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,340
我要扮演原告之一
I'm playing the part of the plaintiff.

241
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,960
我知道你很生气
Wow. I knew you were pissed,

242
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,500
但没想到你这么小心眼
but I didn't realize you were petty.

243
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,930
-什么意思  -是个形容词
- What does that mean? - It's an adjective.

244
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,710
意思是心胸狭隘又恶毒
It means small-minded and spiteful.

245
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,950
你居然帮我的对手
You chose to work with the one guy who's going against me.

246
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
凯尔征求我意见  我同意了
Kyle asked me, and I said yes.

247
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:37,840
算了
You know what?

248
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,940
无所谓  反正你也没机会出庭作证
It doesn't really matter,'cause you're never gonna take the stand.

249
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,040
是吗  为什么
Really? How's that?

250
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,080
等着瞧吧
It's a surprise.

251
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,980
准备期待模拟庭审传奇的诞生吧
But prepare to watch a mock trial legend be born.

252
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,960
律师们都准备好各自的开场陈述了吗
Is counsel ready to proceed with opening statements?

253
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,990
我们打算提交一份调解协议
We'd like to submit a settlement agreement--

254
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,420
原告律师准备就绪  法官大人
The plaintiff is ready, your honor.

255
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,810
到底谁说了算  律师
Which is it, counselor?

256
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,760
原告律师和我
The counsel for the plaintiff

257
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,890
昨天达成调解共识
and I agreed to a settlement yesterday.

258
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,790
他肯定是误会了  我们是讨论过
He must've misunderstood. We had discussed,

259
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,120
但并没达成共识
but I never agreed to anything.

260
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,290
你们签了协议吗
Do you have a signed agreement?

261
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,790
没有
No.

262
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,760
那我们准备开始模拟庭审吧
Then we are ready to proceed.

263
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,150
由你先开始
You have the floor.

264
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,090
谢谢
Thank you.

265
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,430
2010年3月31日
On March 31, 2010,

266
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,580
西德尼・汤普森对于自己电话被录音一事
Sydney Thompson was unwittingly recorded

267
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,560
毫不知情
on a cell phone.

268
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,950
她开了个玩笑 
She made a joke,

269
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,920
我相信法庭里的每个人 
the type of joke that I'm sure every person in this courtroom

270
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,850
都曾开过这样的玩笑
has made at one point or another...

271
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,360
罗斯先生
Mr. Ross.

272
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,720
罗斯先生
Mr. Ross!

273
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,110
你准备好了吗
Are you ready?

274
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,280
被告方
Um, the, uh, the defense...

275
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,190
根据波马斯特状告怀特里一案的结果
According to Bowmaster V. Whitely,

276
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,060
如果一方当事人
if the party to a settlement is surprised

277
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,810
突然得知和解被拒
by the repudiation of the settlement,

278
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,340
那么法庭必须给出合理时限
then the court must provide a reasonable amount of time

279
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,640
让其做好庭审准备
to prepare for the trial.

280
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,660
-合理时限  -是的  法官大人
- Reasonable time. - Yes, your honor.

281
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,910
给你五分钟
You get five minutes.

282
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,790
维加不止这些资产
Vega has more property.

283
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,370
迪贝克更有潜力
Debeque has more potential.

284
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,620
潜力很难用金钱来衡量
Which is harder to monetarily define.

285
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,370
这不是图书馆  斯科特
This isn't a library, Scottie.

286
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,510
我的客户不懂并购
My guy's an up-and-comer.

287
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,000
所以你的客户才会想搞突袭
That's why your guy's pouncing.

288
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,720
你的委托人是位冲动型购物者
Your client is an impulse shopper,

289
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,280
这就导致他成功得快
which is what may have made him a quick success,

290
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,310
但失败得也快
but it could make him an even faster failure.

291
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,450
他是个充满激情的人
So he's a passionate guy.

292
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,110
他每爱上一座城市  就在那里建一座酒店
He falls in love with a city, and he builds himself a hotel.

293
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,580
你凭什么对他的业绩提出质疑呢
Who are you to argue with his track record?

294
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,430
我是现实主义者
I'm a realist,

295
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,960
我从没见过哪个项目能谈得这么快
and I have never seen a deal pushed through so quickly.

296
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,790
那又怎样
So what?

297
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,430
也许你的客户明早一觉醒来
So your guy might wake up tomorrow

298
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,050
就反悔不想谈了
and decide that he doesn't wanna do this,

299
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,270
所以在没有签好协议前
which is why I'm not showing you

300
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,470
我不会给你看我们的内部账簿
our private books without a signed deal.

301
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,610
-是开玩笑吗  -我在笑吗
- Is that a joke? - Am I laughing?

302
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,370
虽然在并购培训班  我总是打瞌睡...
Look, I may not have been awake during our M&A clinic--

303
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,240
除了你抄我笔记的时候
Except for when you were copying my notes.

304
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,410
没那么简单  你写字速度像超人
Which was no walk in the park. You wrote like a monkey.

305
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,400
不管怎样  尽职审查是必须的
But in any case, due diligence is a requirement.

306
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,290
我对我的委托人有义务
I have an obligation to my client.

307
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,350
那我们没法达成协议了
Then we don't have a deal.

308
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,130
大家都会知道是你否了这个协议
And everyone's gonna know it's because you killed it.

309
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,530
知道吗...
You know...

310
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,510
看来你并不急着把你们的内部账簿给我们看
I don't see you rushing to show us your private books.

311
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,930
我没什么好隐瞒的
I have nothing to hide.

312
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,190
你现在完全可以看我们的账簿
You can have full access to our books right now.

313
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,130
很好  你给我看你们的  我给你看我们的
Great. You show me yours, and I'll show you mine.

314
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,900
别说出来  哈维
Don't say it, Harvey.

315
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,500
迈克
Mike.

316
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,090
-你没事吧  -现在你关心我了
- Hey, are you okay? - Now you care?

317
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,440
罗斯先生  我要警告你
Mr. Ross, I'm gonna have to ask you

318
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,550
不能和我的委托人说话
not to speak to my client.

319
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,600
她不是你的委托人
She's not your client.

320
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,120
她是律师助理瑞秋
She is Rachel the paralegal.

321
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,740
我只有五分钟准备  你最好赶紧从我面前消失
And I only have five minutes, so you should really get out of my face.

322
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,250
-你有什么问题吗  迈克  -我的问题是
- What's your problem, Mike? - My problem is that

323
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,730
你没胆量来一场公平的较量  凯尔
you don't have the balls to make this a fair fight, Kyle.

324
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,280
律师这行就没有公平竞争之说
Lawyering isn't about fighting fair,

325
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,970
你最好不要诬告陷害
and you'd better watch your false accusations,

326
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,200
否则我要告你诽谤
or I might just sue you for defamation.

327
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,070
跟我来
Come on.

328
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,060
被告方想要反诉
The defendant wishes to countersue.

329
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,060
反诉:简单地说就是在民事诉讼中  被告反告原告

330
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,980
理由呢
On what grounds?

331
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,130
我觉得那是我该说的话  律师
 I believe that's my line, counselor.

332
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,460
毁损名誉
Defamation of character.

333
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,560
原告的录像给莉娜・兰德斯
The plaintiff's video negatively impacted

334
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,020
带来了极其负面的影响
the perception of Lena Lunders

335
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,520
也严重减损了其财政收入
and impaired her financial well-being.

336
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,660
那太荒唐了  法官大人
That's ridiculous, your honor.

337
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,050
为了诽谤中伤我的委托人
In order for there to be defamation,

338
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,930
证据录像可能是伪造出来的
the statements made would've been false.

339
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,840
这和本案无关
That's not the case here.

340
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,010
那么你应该可以在法庭上给出相应的证明
Then you should have no problem proving that in court.

341
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,270
反诉成立
The countersuit is allowed.

342
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,080
你是认真的吗
Are you serious?

343
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,830
你是不是想要到法官席前
Would you like to approach the bench

344
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,420
看看我到底有多认真
and find out how serious I am?

345
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,550
法官大人  被告方应该在开庭前
Your honor, the defense should've filed counterclaims

346
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,620
上交反诉材料
before the trial began.

347
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,030
是的  应该是这样
Yes, he should have.

348
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,630
但这么多助理中  没人有这种远见
But no one in this crop of associates had the foresight to do so.

349
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,190
我们起草了完整的案情附录
And we drafted a whole addendum

350
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,560
以免你们有人提出反诉
just because we assumed one of you would.

351
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,820
所以我批准该请求
So I'm going to allow it.

352
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,890
你对此有意见吗
Do you have a problem with that?

353
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,500
没有  法官大人
No, your honor.

354
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,490
现在改为诽谤案审理
This is now a defamation trial.

355
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,570
准备时间到周五
You have until Friday to prepare.

356
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,200
漂亮的反击  反应很敏捷
Nice recovery. Thinking on your feet.

357
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,040
要不是你太天真  也不用如此了
But you wouldn't have had to if you hadn't been so naive.

358
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,020
谢谢  法官大人
Thank you, your honor.

359
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,160
谈判怎么样
How'd the negotiation go?

360
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,580
你占上风了吗
You come out on top?

361
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,650
为什么你没告诉我斯科特是对方律师
Why didn't you tell me Scottie was opposing counsel?

362
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,410
因为我不希望你怯场
Because I didn't want you to have performance anxiety.

363
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,600
作为律师  她很强势
About the case. She's tough.

364
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,340
-你太无聊了  -你大门没关
- You're obvious. - And your fly's unzipped.

365
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,030
-骗人  -之前是的
- No, it isn't. - But it was earlier today.

366
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,440
你可以做得更好的
You can do better.

367
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,890
斯科特在床上这么说的吗
Ooh, is that what Scottie said?

368
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,690
把合同要点打出来
Type up the deal points.

369
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,060
她让步了  迪贝克会主导大局
I got her to cave. Debeque's gonna run the show.

370
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,600
我不过是给她看了我们的账簿
All I had to do was show her our books.

371
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,710
我真服了
I can't believe it.

372
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,840
你教我的那招把我害惨了
You gave me, like, the worst advice anyone's ever given another person.

373
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,070
戏就演到这儿吧  朱丽叶
Take the drama down a notch, Juliet.

374
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,970
我想要和解  但却彻底被暗算了
I tried to settle, and I got completely blindsided.

375
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,870
我让你和解  没让你扮傻
I told you to settle. I didn't tell you to be stupid.

376
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,860
现实中的庭审可没这么简单
What do you think's gonna happen in the real world?

377
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,320
你要未雨绸缪
You have to be prepared for anything.

378
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,330
但在现实中
Well, in the real world,

379
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,980
我起码不用找人假扮证人
I won't have to be looking for someone to play

380
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,980
来参加我的假冒审判
my fake witness in my fake trial.

381
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,480
等下  你想什么呢
Wait, wait, wait. What do you think?

382
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,110
你以为证人会自己跳出来作证吗
Do you think witnesses are just gonna jump up and present themselves?

383
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,090
不会
'Cause they're not.

384
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,150
有时  即使你有证人
And sometimes when you have one,

385
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,010
他们也可能会消失或放弃
they disappear or recant.

386
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,650
这些情况你都要学会处理
And you know what you do? You deal with it.

387
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,930
模拟庭审旨在明确你想要成为哪类律师
Mock trial is about figuring out what type of lawyer you wanna be,

388
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,760
而律师只有两类  胜者和败者
and there's only two types-- winners and losers.

389
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,380
听起来不错  哈维  但是我没做好准备
That sounds great, Harvey, but I haven't prepared.

390
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,310
我找不到人扮演我的委托人或证人
I don't have anyone to play my client or my witness,

391
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,100
而对方律师又是我不信任的人
and apparently I'm going up against someone that I can't trust.

392
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,910
不管怎样  想办法打败他
Figure out a way to beat him anyway.

393
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,180
对方遵守了规则时  胜者不会去找借口
Winners don't make excuses when the other side plays the game.

394
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,070
唐娜  我校对了酒店合并的最终协议
Hey, Donna, I proofed that final agreement on the hotel merger.

395
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,710
问个问题  哈维会不会用拼写检查啊
Quick question -- has Harvey ever heard of spell-check?

396
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,200
我的天
Oh, my god.

397
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,720
-对不起  -你...
- Sorry. - Are you--

398
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,060
没事  没事  不要紧的  给你
No, no, no. It's okay. Here.

399
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,470
没事  没事  你不用说话
No, no, no. You don't have to talk.

400
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,030
嘘嘘  没事了
Shh, shh, shh. It's okay.

401
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,760
没事的  他有时说的话
It's okay. He says things sometimes,

402
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,530
确实...确实很伤人
and they--and they cut to the bone.

403
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,590
他对我也那样  我懂的  你就...
He does it to me too. I know, so...

404
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,320
不赖吧
It's not bad, right?

405
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,210
我还能像黛咪・摩尔那样单眼流泪
I can also do the Demi Moore single tear--

406
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,490
凡是为了剧情需要  左右眼都可以
left eye or right eye-- if that's better for the character.

407
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,410
好吧  你吓到我了  怎么回事啊
Okay, I'm scared. What's going on?

408
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,450
要为你扮演莉娜・兰德斯
If I'm gonna play Lena Lunders for you,

409
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,730
我得能调动我的全部感情啊
I need to be able to use my full range of emotions.

410
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,000
我的天  爱死你了
Oh, my god. I love you.

411
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,780
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know.

412
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,040
精神集中
Focus.

413
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,760
你还需要一个证人  到了这时候
You need another witness, and at this point,

414
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,260
公司里其他的人都被预定了
everybody else in the firm is booked up.

415
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,450
来找妈妈给你擦屁股了  罗斯
Aw! Is mommy helping you clean up your mess, Ross?

416
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,700
你说谁是妈呢
Am I mommy in this scenario?

417
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,110
什么
What? Uh...

418
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,170
我是说  罗斯是个...小屁孩
Ross is just... a baby.

419
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,940
我的天
Oh, my god.

420
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,790
-真不敢相信我要输给那个二货  -得了
- I cannot believe I'm gonna lose to that tool. - Okay, come on.

421
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,780
少卖可怜了  去外面再找个证人来
No pity parties. Go to an outside source for the other witness.

422
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,940
被告的朋友  你得找个漂亮的
For the best friend you need somebody pretty,

423
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,320
有同情心的  最重要的是
sympathetic, and most importantly,

424
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,520
愿意为你两肋插刀
willing to go above and beyond for you.

425
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,440
你来干嘛
What are you doing here?

426
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,810
珍妮  别这样  我需要你的帮助
Jenny, come on, I need your help.

427
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,310
我没别处可去了
Got nowhere else to go.

428
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,570
你吼我  吻我  推开我  然后消失
You yelled at me. Kissed me. Pushed me away. Disappeared.

429
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,210
我们很久没说话了
I haven't talked to you in forever.

430
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,070
我都不知道你最近在干嘛
I don't even know what's going on in your life.

431
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,640
你要是放我进去  我就说给你听
Well, if you let me in, I'll explain,

432
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,860
我保证这故事很精彩
and I promise it's a really good story.

433
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,600
就是说你一直生活在谎言当中
So you've been living a lie this whole time.

434
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,950
对
Yeah.

435
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,890
太帅了
That's awesome.

436
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,430
-真的吗  -对啊
- Really? - Yeah!

437
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,860
我是说  就双重生活而言
I mean, as far as double lives go,

438
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,140
你大概比不过克拉克・肯特  但也不错了
you're maybe not as cool as Clark Kent, but still.

439
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,140
克拉克・肯特把内裤穿在外面就成了超人

440
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,320
克拉克・肯特
Clark Kent?

441
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,950
行了  你不能再吃了
Okay, you're cut off.

442
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,700
-怎么了  -没事
- What? - Nothing.

443
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,920
能告诉你  感觉真好
It just feels really good to tell you.

444
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,650
我都找不到倾诉对象
I don't really have anybody I can talk to about it.

445
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,490
你信任我嘛
You trust me.

446
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,000
是啊  我想是吧
Yeah. I guess I do.

447
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,190
那样真好
I like that.

448
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,420
不过这个更好
Ooh, but I really like this.

449
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,750
不得不说  哈维
Gotta hand it to you, Harvey.

450
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,990
你虽然不能跟一个女人长相厮守
You may not be able to commit to a woman,

451
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,630
却在这房子里住了很久
but you have been in this place a very long time.

452
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,000
-它懂我  -又没什么需求
- She gets me. - And has no needs.

453
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,970
我想你不知道这里的维护费多高吧
I don't think you understand how high maintenance this place is.

454
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,850
他同意了你的全部条件
He agreed to all your terms...

455
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,810
虽然我抗议说  他本可拿到更多
despite my protest that he could do better.

456
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,900
-那我们完成任务了  -就差几个签名了
- So we're done. - Minus a few signatures.

457
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,050
-那就是没完成  -要我走吗
- That's not done. - Want me to leave?

458
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,110
陪审团各位成员  请注意...
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please note--

459
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,060
能问个问题吗
Can I ask a question?

460
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,170
不  作为证人  你不能提问
No, you can't ask questions as a witness.

461
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,680
不要提问
Don't ask questions.

462
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,650
-陪审团各位成员...  -好吧  我懂了
- Ladies and gentlemen, please-- - Yeah, okay, I know that.

463
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,940
可你在干嘛啊
But, um, what are you doing?

464
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,070
-什么意思  -你走来走去
- What do you mean? - You're walking around

465
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,700
一副不可一世的样子
like you have a giant stick up your ass.

466
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,680
珍妮  这是庭审
It's a trial, Jenny.

467
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,160
我得表现得强势一点
I have to be powerful.

468
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,690
-可那不是你的本性  -多谢夸奖
- But that's not you. - Thanks.

469
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,940
我是说  你很有魅力  又幽默
No, you are charming, and funny,

470
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,590
值得信任  那才是你的强项
and trustworthy. That's your power.

471
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,150
我想混进法学院入学考试时  那是优点 
And that's great when I'm trying to con my way into the LSATs,

472
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,420
但这是法庭啊
but this is a courtroom.

473
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,090
-在这儿不顶用的  -可你的本性没变
- It's useless there. - But it's still you.

474
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,800
那要怎样
So?

475
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,070
深吸一口气
Take a deep breath.

476
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,180
好吧
Okay.

477
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,280
跟我聊聊
Just talk to me.

478
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,460
问我在哪上班
Ask me where do I work.

479
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,360
-你在哪上班  -兰德斯全球联盟
- Where do you work? - Lunders Global Initiative.

480
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,840
问我怎么认识西德尼的
Ask me how I know Sydney.

481
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,020
你怎么认识西德尼的
How do you know Sydney?

482
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,720
她曾是我的朋友
She was my friend.

483
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,430
自从她走之后  我一直很想她
And I've missed her every day that she's been gone.

484
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,120
你们为什么断交了
And why aren't you friends anymore?

485
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,820
我不知道
I don't know.

486
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,690
如果你庭审这样表现
If you do it like that...

487
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,020
他们会爱上你的
they'll fall in love with you.

488
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,930
你能把这件脱下来吗  脱掉
Would you take this off? Take it off.

489
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,340
脱啊
Take it...

490
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,290
斯科特  你太棒了
Scottie, that was amazing.

491
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,180
注意啦  哈维
Careful, Harvey.

492
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,220
你得补水
You need to hydrate.

493
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,600
你刚跑了个马拉松
You just ran a marathon.

494
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,350
我觉得你刚刚击败我了
And I think you just beat me.

495
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,180
你怎么一脸律师的神情
That's a lawyer look.

496
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,110
上法学院时
Law school.

497
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,110
模拟审判结束后  在图书馆里
Post-mock trial in the library.

498
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,540
在第二联邦上诉法院
2nd circuit court of appeals.

499
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,350
集体诉讼案期间  在准备室的桌子上
Class action on the prep room table.

500
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,760
邓普斯和解案  在我办公室里
Dempsey settlement, in my office,

501
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,000
在桌上桌下都做过
On the desk and under.

502
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,800
干嘛呢  亮点总结啊
So what are we doing? Um, a highlight reel?

503
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,330
没错啊  那些都是最具亮点时刻  对不
As a matter of fact, we are. Those were top moments, right?

504
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,000
-确实不赖  -不止是不赖  是棒极了
- They weren't bad. - No, they were great.

505
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,110
而我刚刚意识到这次要比那几次还亮
And I just realized this was better.

506
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,130
你刚才是达到了最高境界
You were the best you've ever been,

507
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,770
-而我也知道为什么  -为什么
- and I know why. - Why?

508
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,350
谈判时你对我有所隐瞒
You hid something from me in the negotiation,

509
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,850
我要知道你瞒了什么
and I wanna know what.

510
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,070
你知道吗  你的猜测太荒唐了
You know what? You are ridiculous.

511
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,740
别假装你什么都不知道  好吗
Oh, you know what? Don't do that, okay?

512
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,850
-知道什么  -你以为我不知道
- Do what? - You think I don't know

513
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,380
-这是一场胜利的欢爱吗  -什么
- victory sex when I see it, huh? - See it?

514
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,500
到底是怎么回事
What is it?

515
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,680
是不是维加哪里的产业要垮了
Was it one of Vega's properties is bankrupt?

516
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,070
是布宜诺斯艾利斯那边吗
The Buenos Aires one?

517
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,530
你还指望我说什么呢  哈维
Wh-wh-what do you want me to say, Harvey?

518
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,740
没错  你猜对了 你上了我的套
Yes, you got me! I screwed you.

519
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,110
-怎么回事  -天哪
-How? - Oh, my God.

520
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,580
你想现在听我解析吗
You want an anatomy lesson now?

521
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,160
那是我的衬衫
That's my shirt.

522
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,810
把它看作我打败你的奖赏吧
Consider it a winner's reward.

523
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,470
哈维
Hey, Harvey.

524
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,670
你想得没错
You were right.

525
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,610
在过去二十四小时里
There's been a steady stream of stock buying

526
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,640
维加的公司一直在收购我们的股票
by Vega's company in the last 24 hours.

527
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,000
这是敌意收购
It's a hostile takeover.

528
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,770
没错  但他们为什么要打合并的幌子呢
Yeah, but why are they disguising it as a merger?

529
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,590
他们想拿到我们的内部账簿
They wanted access to our private books.

530
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,340
-她耍了我一把  -什么  
- She tricked me. - What?

531
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,100
她假装不愿意交出他们的账簿
She pretended she didn't wanna hand over their books

532
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,040
这样她要我们的账簿时  我就不会留意
so I wouldn't notice when she asked for ours.

533
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,210
这是个老套的伎俩了
It's a classic maneuver.

534
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,150
-她让我以为这是我的主意  -你怎么知道的
- She made me think it was my idea. - How do you know that?

535
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,460
因为这招是我教她的
 'Cause I taught her how to do it.

536
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,360
现在他们知道迪贝克的公司实力有多强
So now they see how strong Debeque's company is,

537
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,500
所以想要收购
and they wanna buy it.

538
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,790
而且他们会在斯科特回伦敦之前就开始运营
And they'll be running it by the time Scottie's back in London.

539
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,260
哇  我才离开你两天  就出了篓子
Wow. I leave you alone for two days...

540
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,130
对  这次是我的错
Yeah, this is my mistake.

541
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,550
这就像哈雷彗星一样罕见
This is Halley's comet.

542
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,490
仔细看吧  因为不会再有下次了
Take a good look, 'cause it won't happen again.

543
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,240
那你打算怎么办
So what are you gonna do?

544
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,930
我想知道迪贝克最值钱的酒店有哪些
I wanna know which of Debeque's hotels are the most valuable

545
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,020
还有我们最快要多久才能让它们上市
and how fast we can get them on the market.

546
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,360
等等  你想让迪贝克卖掉他最好的酒店吗
Wait, you want Debeque to sell his best hotels?

547
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,130
这叫做弃车保帅
It's called the crown jewel defense.

548
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,070
我们放弃最值钱的资产
We unload the highest grossing assets,

549
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,060
这会让别人对他的公司失去兴趣
and we make ourselves look undesirable.

550
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,500
迪贝克绝对不会同意的
Debeque'll never agree to that.

551
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,550
相信我  迪贝克对他的公司倾注了巨大的心血
Trust me. Debeque has enough passion for his company

552
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,580
为了保全大局  他不会计较这点得失  
that he'll be willing to chop off an arm to save the body.

553
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,470
好吧
Okay.

554
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,350
你过目不忘  是吧
You know you had that memorized the first time you read it, right?

555
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,200
是啊  但我还没过目完呢
Yeah, but I didn't finish reading it

556
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,970
因为有个证人在我眼前晃来晃去
because a certain witness chose to be distracting.

557
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,880
那还真是难为你了
That must've been rough for you.

558
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,240
是啊  很纠结
Yeah, you have no idea.

559
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,890
哪儿有水
Where can I get some water?

560
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,620
我怕等会儿嗓子会哑
I need to make sure my voice holds up.

561
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,480
就在那边
Right there.

562
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,780
我们来订个协议
I'll make you a deal.

563
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,320
赢了的可以得到那个妞
The winner gets the girl.

564
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,880
我可不想再跟你订什么协议了
You know, I'm never gonna make another deal with you again.

565
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,510
-是吗  为什么
- No? - Why not?

566
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,100
-你是不是要迟到了  -没错
- Aren't you late for... - Oh, I am.

567
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,010
他们让我想起了少不更事的你和我
They remind me of a younger, less attractive you and me.

568
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,310
拜托别说这种话
Please don't say things like that.

569
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,480
我知道你在操纵赌局
And I know that you rigged the lottery

570
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,930
好让迈克遭受凯尔的蹂躏
so that Mike would get Kyle.

571
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,500
操纵也好  推动也好  只是说法不同
Please. Rigged, expedited, they're all just words.

572
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,730
况且  你不想看你的小朋友如何表现吗
Besides, don't you wanna see what your boy is made of?

573
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,480
你是想让我也下注吗
You talking bet?

574
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,270
-没错  -赌金跟以前一样
- Yeah. - Usual amount.

575
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,740
那就这么定了
I believe we have a wager.

576
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,960
你知道吗  有些人洗过澡才会来上班
Well, you know what? Some of us shower before we go to work.

577
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,570
-斯佩克特先生  -省省吧
- Mr. Specter-- - You know what? Save it.

578
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,220
好吧
Right.

579
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,700
你感觉如何
How you feeling?

580
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,870
-很好  -很好
-Good. - Good?

581
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,120
-没错  -那就好
- Yeah. - Good.

582
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,560
上庭作证之前吃安定
Is it inappropriate to take a xanax

583
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,040
是不是不太好呢
if you're a witness in a trial?

584
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,950
我见过有些委托人做得更过分
I've seen clients do much worse.

585
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,130
其实  我不是委托人
Actually, I'm not a client.

586
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,420
我是来为我朋友的模拟庭审做证人的
I'm a witness in a friend's mock trial.

587
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,880
记住一点  如果进展不顺利
One thing-- if you get into trouble,

588
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,810
就不要再针对案情  要针对人
don't play the case. Play the man.

589
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,080
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

590
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,350
好律师会去研究事实
Good lawyers worry about facts.

591
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,510
而伟大的律师则研究对手
Great lawyers worry about their opponents.

592
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,540
凯尔骄傲自大  手段奸猾 
Kyle is cocky and devious.

593
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,890
想办法利用这点打败他
Figure out a way to use that against him.

594
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,480
明白  还有吗
Okay. Anything else?

595
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,390
狠狠地教训他一顿
Kick his ass.

596
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,360
-你的朋友是谁  -迈克・罗斯
- Who's your friend? - Oh, uh, Mike Ross.

597
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,380
你认识他吗
Do you know him?

598
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,400
算是吧  虽然公司很大
Uh, yeah. Uh, it's a big firm,

599
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,680
但我知道他是谁
but I know who he is.

600
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,570
是吧
Yeah.

601
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,870
天啊  我不知道我怎么这么紧张
God, I don't know why I'm so nervous.

602
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,990
我知道这对他很重要
I just know this is a big deal to him,

603
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,750
我不想让他失望
and I don't wanna let him down.

604
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,780
西德尼・汤普森在一个聚会上开了个玩笑
Sydney Thompson was at a party and made a joke.

605
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,420
她并无恶意  也没想到会被信以为真
It wasn't meant to be mean or to be taken as fact,

606
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,750
更不希望将其公开
and it most certainly was never meant to be public.

607
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,000
辩方将会证明...
The defense will show--

608
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,310
西德尼・汤普森明知自己的行为
That Sydney Thompson chose to publicly

609
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,130
会损害莉娜・兰德斯的名誉
defame her boss with an impression

610
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,520
及其公司的利益
that she knew would be damaging,

611
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,380
却依然公开诽谤了她的老板
both to Lena Lunders' reputation and her company.

612
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,110
我方传唤莉娜・兰德斯出庭作证
I call Lena Lunders to the stand.

613
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,760
呃  你要休息一下吗
Uh...do you need a minute?

614
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,710
不
No.

615
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,680
我可以继续  谢谢关心
I can continue. Thank you.

616
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,350
请开始吧
Please.

617
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,950
我是个自食其力的女人
I'm a self-made woman.

618
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,190
我一手建立起全球联盟
I created the Global Initiative

619
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,920
专门解决第三世界国家的问题
to target problems in third-world countries.

620
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,210
我很看重自己的事业
I take my work very seriously,

621
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,020
如果有人拿这个开玩笑
and if a joke can be made of that,

622
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,440
请便
fine.

623
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,760
但是作为一个身居高位的女人
But as a woman in power,

624
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,470
人们只看到你的成功的一面
people look at your success and label you.

625
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,050
他们不知道一个女人
They don't know the complexity it takes

626
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,370
要在这一行取得成功有多艰难
for a woman to succeed in this business.

627
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,910
如果有人贬低你辛苦取得的成就
And when someone undermines that,

628
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,640
那...
well...

629
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,240
我们就不得不为自己抗辩了
we have to fight for ourselves...

630
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,880
不是吗  法官大人
Don't we, your honor?

631
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,160
反对
Objection.

632
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,100
你是在阐述做职场女性很艰难吗
So it's hard to be a woman in business?

633
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,850
这和本案的事实毫无关系
That has nothing to do with the facts of this case.

634
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,360
要想了解你的委托人给兰德斯小姐
Well, we can only understand the damage

635
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,850
造成了多大损失  我们必须充分理解
your client has done by fully understanding the care

636
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,330
她是如何苦心树立起威信的
with which Miss Lunders has built her reputation.

637
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,290
对不起
Um, I'm sorry.

638
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,370
你能再问一遍吗
Can you ask me the question one more time?

639
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,030
深呼吸
Take a deep breath.

640
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,440
这只是你我之间的对话
It's just you and me.

641
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,590
谈谈你的工作  好吗
We're just gonna have a conversation about your job, okay?

642
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,690
好的
Yeah, okay.

643
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,730
你是如何认识被告西德尼・汤普森的
How do you know the defendant Sydney Thompson?

644
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,570
我们是同事  入司时级别相同
We were coworkers. We started at the same level,

645
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,070
后来我被提升为她的直属上司
and then I was promoted to be her immediate superior.

646
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,010
你了解视频一事吗
And do you know about the video in question?

647
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,920
是的  我参加了那晚的聚会
Yes. I was at the party that night.

648
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,440
你们那晚是在庆祝什么
And what were you celebrating that night?

649
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,320
庆祝我升职一事
My promotion.

650
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,560
同一个晚上  有意思
Same night. That's interesting.

651
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,210
金妮斯小姐
Miss Ginnesse.

652
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,170
你对模仿一事怎么看
What did you think of the impersonation?

653
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,970
既过分又刻薄
It was too far. It was mean.

654
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,230
那你认为汤普森小姐为何会那么做
So why do you think Miss Thompson did it?

655
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,160
兰德斯提拔了我  
Miss Lunders promoted me.

656
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,320
西德尼很不爽
Sydney hated it.

657
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,330
所以她拍了那个视频
And that's why she made the video.

658
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,170
谢谢  金妮斯小姐
Well, thank you, Miss Ginnesse.

659
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,710
讯问完毕  法官大人
Nothing further, your honor.

660
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,970
西德尼有没有告诉你
Did Sydney ever tell you

661
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,940
她对你的提拔很不满
that she hated your promotion?

662
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,720
-不完全是这样   -请回答有还是没有
- Not exactly.  - Yes or no, please.

663
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,510
-没有  -那你怎么知道
- No. - Well, then how do you know

664
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,510
她对你的升职不满
that she hated your promotion?

665
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,910
我能看出来
I could just tell.

666
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,770
你能看出我现在在想什么吗
Can you tell what I'm thinking right now?

667
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,310
希望我对你所说的每一句话都毫无异议吗
That you're wishing I would agree with everything you say?

668
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,010
不对  我在想  如果你能读出我的想法
No. I was thinking that if you could actually read my mind,

669
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,530
我就不用费事问你这些问题了
I wouldn't bother asking you the questions.

670
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,940
但你读不出我的想法  对吗
But you can't read my mind, can you?

671
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,140
不能  我...我是经理...
No, I'm--I'm managing director--

672
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,790
不  我敢肯定你也读不出西德尼的想法
No. And I'm pretty sure you can't read Sydney's either.

673
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,360
所以你其实不知道她为何拍了那段视频
And you actually have no idea why she made that video.

674
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,690
对吗
Correct?

675
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,630
是的  我不知道
I guess I don't. No.

676
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,130
下午好  斯科特小姐
Good afternoon, Miss Scott.

677
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,130
谢谢
Thank you.

678
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,340
你是想给我个体面的告别吗
Are you here to give me a proper send-off?

679
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,530
在大街上不能干那种事儿吧
I don't think we can do that out here on the street.

680
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,910
-你确定吗  -你骗过了我
- You sure? - You tricked me.

681
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,420
我很佩服
I'm impressed.

682
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,850
公平地说  维加确实想进行合并
To be fair, Vega did want a merger.

683
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,020
我刚说服他
I just convinced him that,

684
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,820
鉴于你客户鲁莽收购的一贯做法
given your client's propensity for rash purchases,

685
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,670
让他继续掌权不是个好主意
that allowing him to stay in charge was a bad idea.

686
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,610
维加想要迪贝克的酒店  而不希望他来管理
Vega needed Debeque's hotels  minus Debeque,

687
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:22,790
我想出了一个办法
and I found a way.

688
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,740
你的办法不会让他满意的
One that he never asked for or wanted,

689
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,420
而且他也不需要你的建议了
and one that he's never gonna get.

690
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,100
这...这是真的吗
Was--is this for real?

691
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,340
迪贝克的三处房产
Three of Debeque's properties.

692
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,830
将于今晚上市
It'll be on the market by the end of the day.

693
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,080
他绝不会让你卖掉他的王牌产业的
He's never gonna let you sell off his crown jewels.

694
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,900
强硬的客户有一点好处
See, that's the thing about passionate clients.

695
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,770
一经背叛  他们会恼羞成怒
When they're crossed, they get angry,

696
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,410
不惜一切代价进行反击
and they'll do anything to get back.

697
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,210
别这样  哈维
Don't do this, Harvey.

698
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,690
还有一个办法
Look, there's another way we can do this.

699
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,260
我们把客户都约到一起
We can get our clients into a room together.

700
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,880
你向他们认个错
You can tell them you were wrong,

701
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,060
然后说服他们继续商讨合并事宜
and we can convince them back into a merger.

702
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,780
汤普森小姐  你拍模仿视频的目的是什么
Miss Thompson, what was the intent behind your impersonation?

703
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,420
我只是想搞搞笑
I was just trying to be funny.

704
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,240
办公室里人人都讲笑话
Everyone in our office makes jokes,

705
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,790
而事实上
And as a matter of fact,

706
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,830
兰德斯女士鼓励我们不拘礼节
Ms. Lunders encourages us to be informal.

707
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,900
仅凭事实  我赢不了这个案子
I can't win this just on facts.

708
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,720
但我预料到了
But I expected it.

709
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,660
我想每个人都渴望升职
I think everyone has the impulse to move up,

710
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,430
但某些时候  你不得不学会释然
but at a certain point, you just have to let it go.

711
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,830
我就是这么做的
So that's what I did.

712
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,110
你打算怎么做
What are you gonna do?

713
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,340
我从未对老板心怀恶意
I've never held ill will for my boss.

714
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,560
我得在这个女人身上做文章  而不是案子本身
I'm gonna play the woman, not the case.

715
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,240
你说你预料到自己不会被提拔  对吗  
You say you expected to be passed over for a promotion, correct?

716
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,070
-是的  -而且你已经申请过三次了
- Yes. - And yet you applied three times?

717
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,550
-是的  -而你却从未被提拔
- Yes. - And you were never promoted?

718
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,740
如我所说  是的
As I said, yes.

719
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,520
而当娜拉・金妮斯升职时
And when Nora Ginnesse was promoted,

720
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,600
你给其他同事写了措辞刻薄的电子邮件
you wrote scathing emails to the rest

721
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,230
-作为回应  -不  并非刻薄
- of your coworkers in response. - No, not scathing.

722
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,780
我的初衷只是搞笑
The intent was to be funny.

723
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,770
对了  你喜欢搞笑
Oh, right, you like to be funny.

724
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,290
谁不喜欢笑口常开呢
Who doesn't like to laugh?

725
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,200
因此而名誉扫地的人不会喜欢的
Someone whose reputation has been ruined.

726
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,310
-反对  -个人想法而已
- Objection. - Just a thought.

727
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,800
-这是在自证  -反对有效
- It's testifying. - Sustained.

728
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,530
罗斯先生  请提问 
Mr. Ross, questions.

729
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,610
对不起  法官大人
I'm sorry, your honor.

730
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,720
原谅我  我只是想搞笑
Forgive me. I was just trying to be funny.

731
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,390
在你的绩效评估报告上  莉娜・兰德斯写道
On your performance review, Lena Lunders wrote,

732
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,560
"敬业精神可嘉  缺乏工作技巧"
"Good work ethic. Lacks skills."

733
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,320
你觉得这样的评价公平吗
Do you think that's a fair assessment?

734
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,850
公平  我...我不知道
Fair? I--I don't know.

735
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,840
你的同事们都升职了
Well, your coworkers were promoted,

736
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,510
而你的老板却认为你只是个庸才
and your boss was calling you mediocre.

737
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,030
-你是庸才吗  -不是
- Are you mediocre? - No.

738
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,110
那为何你没被提拔
So why haven't you been promoted?

739
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,230
我不知道
I don't know.

740
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,180
你觉得自己有资格得到更好的待遇吗
Do you think you deserve better?

741
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,200
-人人都有资格吧  - 那你为何没去尝试
- Doesn't everyone? - So why haven't you tried?

742
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,420
-我试了  -那你为什么没有进步
- I have tried. - Why haven't you improved?

743
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,780
我没说过我没进步
I didn't say I haven't improved.

744
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,070
你的考核报告上说了
Well, your review did.

745
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,940
你五年以来都没升职  也证明了这点
Your five years without a promotion did.

746
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,880
你因为自己没被提拔而恼羞成怒
Look, you were so angry that you weren't moving forward

747
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,570
将怨气发泄在你老板身上...
that you lashed out at your boss--

748
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,880
-不  -反对  自证其罪
- No. - Objection! Testifying!

749
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,550
-别人都爬得比你高  -那又怎样
- Everyone was moving past you. - So what?

750
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,830
他们凭借能力实现了目标
People making good on their--

751
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,920
纠缠证人  法官大人
Badgering, your honor.

752
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,000
-反对有效  -他们能够有所成就
- Sustained. - People who could cut it.

753
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,240
我也能成功
I can cut it!

754
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,320
对不起  法官大人
Excuse me, your honor.

755
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,860
和解协议仍然有效
Settlement's still on the table.

756
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,380
-什么  -我们和解吧
- What? - Let's settle.

757
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,040
同样的条件  双赢
Same deal. Win-win.

758
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,660
-不  我不和解  -你说什么
- No, I'm good. - Excuse me?

759
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,370
我知道那表情是什么意思  罗斯
I've seen the moony looks, Ross.

760
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,100
你喜欢她
You like her,

761
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,330
所以你给我提供了一个和解方案
so you're offering me a settlement

762
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,590
因为你不想伤害她
because you don't want to hurt her feelings.

763
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,520
但是我宁愿看到你伤害她
But I'd rather see if you'll break her.

764
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,790
醒醒吧  兄弟
Giddy-up, cowboy.

765
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,810
律师
Counselor.

766
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,770
还要继续问吗
Would you like to proceed?

767
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,100
我问完了  法官大人
No, your honor.

768
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,160
-你确定吗  -是的  法官大人
- Are you sure? - Yes, your honor.

769
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,410
没有问题了
Nothing further.

770
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:52,730
正常情况下我们要开始结案陈词了
Well, normally we'd move on to closing statements,

771
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,530
但这一周大家都很疲惫
but it's been a long week,

772
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,760
而且我们都知道结果是什么了
and honestly, we all know where this is going.

773
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,000
所以法庭判决被告获胜
So court rules in favor of the defendant.

774
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,870
休庭
This court is adjourned.

775
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,220
罗斯先生
Mr. Ross.

776
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,110
天真  心软
Naive and soft.

777
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,320
不是皮尔逊・哈德曼律所提倡的品质
Not qualities we're looking for at Pearson Hardman.

778
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,610
先生们  我很感激你们能心平气和坐下来谈谈
Gentlemen, I appreciate you leaving the swords at home.

779
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,070
我们从一个纯粹的合并案开始
What started off as a true merger

780
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,890
并不希望搞出别的事情来
never needed to become anything different.

781
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,470
丹尼尔  我希望你听我说
Daniel, I want you to listen to me.

782
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,960
我了解哈维  他只想和你的公司合并
I know Harvey, and he just wants to merge your businesses

783
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,380
这样他的时薪就能加倍了
so he can double his billable hours.

784
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,850
行了  斯科特
Quiet, Scott.

785
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,410
我想听听他要说什么
I wanna hear what he has to say.

786
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,010
我过来是替我的客户达成他想要的交易
I'm just here to get my client the deal that he wants,

787
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,620
他要的就是合并  不是吗  琼斯
and what he wants is a merger, is that right, Jones?

788
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,210
没错
That's right.

789
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:18,150
丹尼尔 你的律所已经走到了
Daniel. Your law firm overreached in a situation

790
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,370
进退两难的境地
where it wasn't necessary.

791
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,210
并不完全是斯科特的错
It's not entirely Scottie's fault.

792
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,220
好胜是律师的天性
We lawyers all have an instinct to win,

793
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,500
但是有时候我们可能
but sometimes we may

794
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,930
不能完全理解这意味着什么
not fully understand what that means.

795
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,340
我们知道这意味着什么
We understand what it means.

796
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,150
也许你知道  也许你不知道
Well, maybe you do, and maybe you don't.

797
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,580
对我而言
For me,

798
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,800
这意味着两位男士谈回到最初的协议
it would be to see both men return to the initial deal

799
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,920
使双方的生意达成共赢
so that you can grow both your businesses,

800
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,370
而不是一个公司声誉扫地
instead of having one company with a hostile reputation

801
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,560
而另一家像以前一样变成空壳
and the other a shell of what it once was.

802
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,240
对我来说  那可算不上是胜利
I mean, that doesn't sound like a win to me.

803
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,870
抱歉
I'm sorry.

804
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,280
我们继续谈最初的那个协议吧
Let's just go back to the original deal.

805
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,870
我们可以一起经营
We can run it together.

806
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,070
需要帮忙吗
You need anything?

807
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,860
要是没有我就走了
'cause otherwise I'm gonna head out.

808
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,200
去和助理们喝庆功酒吗
Celebratory drinks with the associates?

809
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,420
是啊
Yep.

810
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,620
你有什么可庆祝的
And what exactly are you celebrating?

811
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,550
不用跟我说什么你很失望  哈维
You know what? You can save the disappointment, Harvey.

812
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,950
-我知道我做了什么  -是吗
- I know what I did. - Do you?

813
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,330
我看到的是你退缩了
Because what I saw is that you backed off

814
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,560
因为你担心伤害你女朋友的感情
because you were worried about hurting your girlfriend's feelings.

815
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,920
这只是一场模拟庭审
It was a fake trial.

816
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,460
对吧  我斟酌了利弊
All right? I weighed the pros and the cons,

817
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,900
觉得为了结果而伤害别人不值得
and I decided it wasn't worth hurting someone for the result.

818
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,320
结果就是你让公司里的每个合伙人
The result is you just told every partner in this firm,

819
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,450
包括我  都知道你是个草包
including myself, that you have a weak stomach,

820
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,210
你没胆子  狠不下心
that you don't have what it takes.

821
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,880
你一直告诉我  我必须选择
You know, you keep telling me that I have to decide

822
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,400
要成为一个怎样的律师
what kind of lawyer I wanna be.

823
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,960
如果我够聪明  大概会成为你这样的律师
And if I were smart, I'd probably be just like you,

824
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,520
因为每个人都知道你是最棒的
because everybody knows you're the best.

825
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,860
但我同样要决定我要成为一个怎样的人
But I'm also trying to decide what kind of person I wanna be.

826
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,660
有时候  相比较你那类人
And sometimes I like my kind of person

827
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,270
我还是更喜欢我这样的
a lot more than yours.

828
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,910
你想知道我是个怎样的人吗
You wanna know what kind of person I am?

829
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,400
心狠手辣但是讲究公平
Tough but fair.

830
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,770
我只说我所看到的
I call it like I see it.

831
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,530
我看到的是一个孩子渴求一个机会
And what I see is a kid who asked for an opportunity

832
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,590
却还不确定  这是不是他想要的
who still hasn't decided if he wants it or not.

833
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,220
来一杯纯麦威士忌
Single malt, please.

834
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,330
怎么来哈佛俱乐部了  我以为你讨厌这地方
Harvard Club? I thought you hate this place.

835
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,500
维加把我从他的酒店赶出来了
Vega kicked me out of his hotel,

836
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,200
你知道的  给人打工...
so, you know, beggars...

837
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,140
别装委屈了
Save the pout.

838
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,950
你当过《法律评论》的头儿
You were head of Law Review,

839
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,550
你是高法法官的书记员
you clerked for a Supreme Court judge,

840
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,820
而且几乎把我打败了
and you almost beat me.

841
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,510
我觉得为这个得喝一杯
I think that deserves a drink.

842
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:11,830
你请客
On you.

843
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,800
我想高兴点儿  但是我刚被炒鱿鱼了
I'd laugh, but I just got fired.

844
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,440
被事务所解雇了吗
From the firm?

845
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,210
不是
No.

846
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,130
但事务所那边肯定不会满意
But the firm's not going to be happy,

847
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,470
所以我还不想回去
And that's why I'm not already on a plane.

848
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,370
我认识的斯科特可要比这坚强得多
Hey, the Scottie I know is tougher than that.

849
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:29,980
是吗
Is she?

850
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:38,310
你想重回母校
Well, you wanna go back to our alma mater

851
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,460
听一场为何女性在科学方面更出色的讲座吗
and see a lecture on why women are better at science?

852
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,700
可能会让你振作起来
Might cheer you up.

853
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,810
可能吧  但我不会和你一起去了
Maybe, but I'm not going with you.

854
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,710
别这样  我们还是朋友  不是吗
Come on, we're still friends, aren't we?

855
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,570
我要结婚了  哈维
I'm getting married, Harvey.

856
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,810
未婚夫叫斯蒂夫
His name is Steve, and, uh,

857
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,250
一个月前他向我求了婚
he asked me a month ago, and, um,

858
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,480
等我回到伦敦
when I get back to London I'm--

859
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,840
我要答应他了
I'm going to say yes.

860
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,140
你想要我说什么
What would you like me to say?

861
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:17,990
什么也别说了
Nothing.

862
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,020
过来
Come here.

863
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,070
很抱歉我赢了
I'm sorry I won.

864
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,300
不  哈维
No, Harvey...

865
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,260
我讨厌你为了这个说抱歉
I would hate it if you were sorry about that.

866
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,430
你没必要这么做
You didn't have to do that, you know.

867
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,740
-我知道  -我本可以承受的
- I know. - I could've handled it.

868
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,540
-我知道  -你可能没听出来
- I know. - That was a thank-you,

869
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,300
我是在说谢谢
If you couldn't tell.

870
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,490
我明白
I could tell.

871
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,790
珍妮是个不错的证人
So, um, Jenny was a great witness.

872
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,430
既可爱又漂亮
Really likeable and pretty.

873
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,570
是的  是啊
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

874
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,570
我知道这周我对你态度不好
I know I was hard on you this week.

875
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,810
-没事  -不是
- It's okay-- - No, it--

876
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,430
你有没有想过
Did you ever take a minute to wonder

877
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,290
我为什么这么生你的气
why I was so mad at you?

878
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,010
我对你的期待比对大多数人都高
I just expect more from you than most people.

879
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,000
为什么
Why?

880
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,550
你是个聪明人
You're a smart guy.

881
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,000
你会想明白的
You can figure it out.
