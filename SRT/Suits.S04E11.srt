《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on Suits

14
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,090
迈克·罗斯从没上过法学院
Mike Ross never went to law school.

15
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,070
我知道  但我还是雇了他
I knew it, and I hired him anyway.

16
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,700
我还是不能留下来  哈维
I still can't stay, Harvey.

17
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,460
我知道
I know.

18
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,570
我只是不想再欺骗我爱的人了
I just want to stop lying to the people I love.

19
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,180
这份文件会表明傅滋曼的付款
This makes it look like Forstman's payment never

20
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,430
从未经过任何离岸账户
went to any offshore accounts.

21
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,370
这可是伪造
That's forgery.

22
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,670
那也比你犯下的罪行要轻
Which is less of a crime than what you did.

23
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,540
我没得选
I had no choice!

24
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,050
去你的没得选
Bullshit, you had no choice!

25
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,430
你可以在任何一个时点上说不
You could've said no at any goddamn point along the way.

26
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,560
有一件事是板上定钉的
One thing is for sure.

27
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,400
当一切结束之后  我会把你炒掉
When all this is over, I'm gonna fire the shit out of you.

28
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,360
我去找了罗伯特·赞恩
I went to Robert Zane

29
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,170
要他给路易一个职位
and I asked him to give Louis a job.

30
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,350
你想看看我能不能打破自己的合伙契约是吧
You want to see if I can break my partnership agreement?

31
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,190
假如你连这个都做不到
If you can't do that,

32
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,750
那你还算什么厉害人物
what the hell good are you?

33
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,070
路易不会去赞恩那里
Louis won't be going to Zane,

34
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,180
你也不会了
and neither will you.

35
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,030
我来请求你无论如何雇下路易
I'm here to ask you to take Louis anyway.

36
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,350
我为什么要雇他
And why would I do that?

37
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,650
你雇下他  我就欠你份情
If you do it, I'll owe you one.

38
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,130
迈克·罗斯过目不忘
Mike Ross doesn't forget anything.

39
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,170
他认不出这钥匙的原因
See, the reason he didn't recognize this

40
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,040
是因为他没上过哈佛
was because he didn't go to Harvard.

41
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,690
你从迈克·罗斯来的第一天就开始骗我
You've been lying to me since the day Mike Ross arrived.

42
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,780
-我是你朋友啊  路易  -不  你不是
- I am your friend, Louis. - No, you're not.

43
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,310
你再也不准对我说那样的话
And don't you ever say that to me again.

44
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,820
你还是直接说吧
So you might as well spit it out.

45
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,250
你曾经问过我想要什么  我告诉了你
You asked me what I wanted once before and I told you.

46
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,950
那时你说我不可能得到
And then you tole me I couldn't have it.

47
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,500
皮尔逊
Pearson.

48
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,170
斯佩克特
Specter

49
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,530
利特
Litt.

50
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,970
什么事那么重要
Want to tell me what was so important

51
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,920
还把我叫回来了
I had to get back here?

52
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,300
他知道了
He knows.

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,050
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

54
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,730
唐娜怎么没告诉你
Why didn't Donna tell you?

55
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,550
我告诉你吧
I'll tell you why.

56
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,000
因为作为冠名合伙人  我的第一项命令
Because as my first official act as name as name partner,

57
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,780
就是叫她别告诉你
I told her not to.

58
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,460
什么
What?

59
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,700
没错
You heard me.

60
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,710
你爱盯着她看多久都行
You can look at her as long as you want.

61
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,940
她帮不了你
She can't help you.

62
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,520
因为我的名字明天一早就要挂上去
Because my name's going up there first thing tomorrow.

63
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,430
别做梦了
No, it isn't.

64
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,520
他没说错
Yes, it is.

65
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,570
但不能明天就做
But it won't be tomorrow.

66
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,970
我不能等着你...
I'm not waiting just so you can--

67
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,490
路易  我得给资深合伙人一个说得过去的理由
Louis, I have to sell this to the senior partners.

68
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,020
我不能突然就把你的名字甩上去
I can't just slap your name up there one morning.

69
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,910
你为他那么做过
You did it for him.

70
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,820
我可没在前一周辞职
I didn't resign the week before.

71
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,460
-我不管  -路易
- I don't care. - Louis.

72
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,710
够了
That's enough.

73
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,190
这事得慢慢来
This is going to take time,

74
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,780
在此期间  你不能对外透露情况
and while it does, you're going to keep this to yourself.

75
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,040
胡扯  你就是在争取时间  想摆脱困境
Bullshit. You're just trying to buy time so you can get out of this.

76
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,780
我没想争取什么
I'm not trying to buy anything.

77
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,490
我们已经说好了  这是为你好
We have an agreement, and this is for your own good.

78
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,890
那为了你好
Well, for your own good,

79
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,280
你最好记住如果让我等太久  我会做出什么事
you better remember what I'll do if this takes too long.

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,800
告诉我你是没有别的办法
Please tell me you had no other choice.

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,240
你很清楚我是没有
You know damn well I didn't.

82
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,350
我不清楚
No, I don't.

83
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,820
那是你没看见他的样子
That's because you didn't see him.

84
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,390
他自出生那一天起  就一直渴望
All he's ever thought about since the day he was born

85
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,840
得到这个
was getting this.

86
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,270
如果我要在满足他的心愿
So if I have to choose between giving it to him

87
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,220
和坐牢之间做选择
and going to jail--

88
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,240
他真威胁你了吗
He really threatened that?

89
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,850
他不止是威胁我
He didn't just threaten it.

90
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,340
他真打算那么做
He was going to do it.

91
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,130
那我们要怎么办
And what are we going to do?

92
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,830
我们要接受
We're going to take it.

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,000
我们满足他这要求  以后会有没完的要求
We give him this, it is never gonna end.

94
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,990
哈维  你再开口之前
Harvey, before you say another word to me,

95
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,770
好好想想
I want you to think about the fact

96
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,780
我刚刚咽下了多大的委屈
that I just ate a big bowl of shit

97
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,290
只因为你把那小子招进了我的律所
because you brought that kid into my house.

98
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,130
但我只能接受
And I had to take it,

99
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,190
所以你也得接受
so you're going to take it.

100
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,190
哈维
Harvey.

101
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,360
你不用说了
You don't need to say it.

102
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,840
我得说
Yeah, I do.

103
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,640
路易来找你  我不知道该怎么办
Louis came looking for you, and I didn't know what to do.

104
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,200
他本打算告诉希拉一切
He was gonna call Sheila and tell her everything.

105
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,340
我从没见过他那副样子
I'd never seen him like that before.

106
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,810
唐娜  这事不怪你
Donna, this is not on you.

107
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,390
就是怪我
Yes, it is.

108
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,230
他逼问我  我崩溃了
He pressed me, and I broke.

109
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,440
那无所谓  他已经知道了
It doesn't matter, because he already knew.

110
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,570
你怎么知道
How can you know that?

111
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,150
因为我了解路易和你
Because I know Louis, and I know you.

112
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,760
如果不是已经知道了事实
And he couldn't have broken you

113
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,530
他不可能逼得你崩溃的
unless he knew the truth already.

114
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,180
所以这不怪你
So this is not your fault,

115
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,970
你再也别说这话了
and I never want to hear you say that again.

116
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,900
我至少该在你回来之前提醒你一下
I should've at least warned you before you got here.

117
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,170
那只会更加激怒他
All that would have done was antagonize him even more

118
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,010
他会知道是你说的
because he would've known you did it.

119
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,390
你已经尽全力了
You did everything you could've done.

120
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,290
好吧
Okay.

121
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,940
我们得告诉迈克
We have to tell Mike.

122
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
不  现在先别说
No, we don't. Not now.

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,260
哈维
Harvey.

124
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,860
我明早告诉他
Look, I'll tell him in the morning.

125
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,220
我们刚刚打赢一场大仗
We just had a huge win,

126
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,670
我不想把他今晚毁掉
and I am not in the mood to ruin his night.

127
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,860
路易
Louis.

128
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,770
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

129
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,330
他们还没告诉你
They didn't tell you.

130
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,330
告诉我什么
Tell me what?

131
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,080
杰西卡让我做冠名合伙人了
Jessica made me name partner.

132
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,220
但是...
But, uh--

133
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,930
但是  但是
But? But?

134
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,150
但是什么
But what?

135
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,810
我之前引咎辞职了吗
I resigned in shame?

136
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,510
情况完全改变了  多亏了你
Well, that's all changed, and it's all because of you.

137
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,770
记得这个吗
Remember this?

138
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,880
不  你不记得
No, you don't,

139
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,190
因为你不可能记得没见过的东西
because you can't remember something you never knew.

140
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,310
到死都这么冷静
Cool to the end.

141
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,880
无所谓了  唐娜已经说了
Well, it doesn't matter, because Donna told me.

142
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,760
还有哈维
And Harvey.

143
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,160
还有杰西卡
And Jessica.

144
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,460
我告诉他们  我知道你是个冒牌货时
When I told them that I knew you were a fraud,

145
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,970
他们就像躲瘟疫一样躲着你
did they run from you like you were the plague.

146
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,140
你想怎么样
What do you want?

147
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,370
我已经得到我想要的了
I already got what I wanted from you.

148
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,800
-冠名合伙人  -你还有别的目的
- Name partner. - You must want something else.

149
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,330
否则你不会来我这儿
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

150
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,970
这就是我喜欢你的地方  迈克
See, that's what I love about you, Mike.

151
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,780
几乎总是先人一步
Almost always a step ahead.

152
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,470
我想要的
What I want from you

153
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,060
是你在我的律所毫无前途
is to know that you're dead at my law firm.

154
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,250
你不能解雇我
You can't fire me.

155
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,230
我为什么要解雇你  我可以击溃你
Why would I fire you when I can break you?

156
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:46,280
我要把你埋在一大堆破烂底下
You see, I'm going to bury you under a mountain of shit so big

157
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,720
你会求我把它挪走
you're going to be begging me to take it off.

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,540
你到时候只要说三个简单的字就行
And all you have to do is say two simple words--

159
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,680
就是你放任我对哈维和杰西卡
the same two words that you let me say

160
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,210
说的那三个字
to Harvey and Jessica.

161
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,450
"我辞职"
"I resign."

162
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,440
路易
Louis.

163
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,750
-你怎么来了  -我要走了
- What are you doing here? - Leaving.

164
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,280
这样我就不用看着你们两个骗子了
That way I don't have to look at either one of you two liars.

165
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,100
天呐  他知道了
Oh, my God, he knows.

166
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,170
他不仅知道了
He doesn't just know.

167
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,830
还成了冠名合伙人
He's a name partner.

168
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,940
-你知道了  -对  我知道了
- You know. - Yeah, I know.

169
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,510
你怎么不提醒我一下
And a little heads up would've been nice.

170
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,690
我想让你最后舒服一晚
I wanted to give you the night.

171
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,400
我这晚是没舒服成
Well, the night kind of got blown up

172
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,040
因为路易跑来我公寓
when Louis showed up at my apartment

173
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,980
说他要击溃我
and said he was gonna break me.

174
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,260
你找我干什么  迈克
What do you want from me, Mike?

175
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,340
我想问你怎么会让他当上了冠名合伙人
I want to know how you let him become name partner.

176
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,960
难道你更希望我们让他去报警吗
Would you rather we let him go to the police?

177
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,190
得了  我才不信路易真会去报警呢
Come on. I don't believe that Louis would actually go to the police.

178
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,930
杰西卡说他会他就会
He would because Jessica said he would.

179
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,740
所以如果你来是为了告诉我
So if you're here to say

180
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,500
我们可以想办法挽回这一切
that we can figure some way out of it,

181
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,790
那是不可能了
that's not going to happen.

182
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,640
他知道了  木已成舟
He knows, and it's done.

183
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,090
你没听到我的话吗
Did you hear what I said?

184
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,000
路易怒火朝天地跑到我公寓来
Louis came to my apartment filled with rage,

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,160
告诉我他会一门心思
and he told me he was making it

186
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,250
打垮我
his personal mission to break me.

187
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,330
那你就专心不要让他打垮
Then you make it your mission not to let him.

188
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,130
哈维  他可是冠名合伙人
Harvey, he's name partner.

189
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,840
我给你讲过健身房的故事吗
Did I ever tell you the story about the gym?

190
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,620
我现在可没心情听故事
I'm not really in the mood for a story right now.

191
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,300
那你无论如何都得听
Then you're going to hear it anyway.

192
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,060
我小时候  我父亲把我送去拳击夏令营
When I was a kid, my father put me in boxing camp.

193
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,340
当时正值盛夏  三十多摄氏度
Middle of summer, 90 degrees.

194
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,480
每天做完拳击练习
Every day after sparring in that,

195
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,260
他们还会逼我们跑一百圈做五十个引体向上
they'd make you do 100 laps and 50 pull-ups.

196
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,040
他们会把我们逼到吐了或者晕倒
They'd push you until you either threw up

197
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,910
或者吐着晕倒
or passed out or both.

198
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,700
任何人都可以随时离开
Anyone could leave at any point.

199
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,060
只要说你放弃就行了
All you had to do was quit.

200
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,460
让我猜猜  你没有放弃
And let me guess, you didn't quit.

201
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,770
我每天都放弃
I quit every goddamn day.

202
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,560
但我从没有说出声
I just never said it out loud.

203
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,440
因为我才不会让他们
Because no way was I gonna give them

204
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,520
获得击垮我的快感
the satisfaction of breaking me.

205
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,620
所以现在轮到我放下身段任由路易摆布了
So I guess it's time for me to drop down and give Louis 20.

206
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,990
我估计他可不会给你好日子过  伙计
I think it's gonna be a little more than 20, buddy.

207
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,760
看来你注意到我把你的律师头衔刮掉了
I see you noticed I scraped your little associate title away.

208
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,820
是你刮掉的
You scraped it away?

209
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,960
是的  我会把你也给刮掉
Yeah, just like I'm gonna scrape you away,

210
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,430
从这些开始
starting with these.

211
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,810
路易  随便你
Oh, Louis, go ahead.

212
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,140
你可以把你能找到的最烂的案子都扔给我
Give me all of the shittiest cases that you can find,

213
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,410
但我告诉你
but I'm telling you,

214
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,660
这招打不垮我
it's not gonna break me.

215
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,470
你太高抬你自己了
You overestimate yourself.

216
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,780
我告诉你我要埋了你的时候
Did you think when I said I was going to bury you in shit,

217
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,770
你以为我是要用法律工作么
I meant legal work?

218
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,140
当然不是
No, no, no.

219
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,150
你不是律师
You're not a lawyer,

220
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,910
也就是说你只能做律师助理
which means you must be a paralegal,

221
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,130
所以你也就只配做律师助理的工作
and that's exactly the kind of work you're gonna be doing.

222
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,300
路易  你不能这样做
Louis, you can't do this.

223
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,650
外面每个人都认为我是律师
Everyone out there thinks of me as a lawyer.

224
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,220
两天前  
And two days ago, 

225
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,290
他们还以为我要走了呢
they thought of me as someone who used to work here.

226
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,960
可你看如今的情况
Look at us now.

227
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,670
而且如果你以为你可以去找哈维哭鼻子
Oh, and if you're thinking of crying to Harvey.

228
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,950
可就大错特错了
that would be a major mistake,

229
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,520
因为这是你和我之间的事
because this is between you and me.

230
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,700
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

231
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,970
我来是因为我知道你很生气
I'm here because I know you're angry

232
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,450
觉得自己被背叛了  但我不会让你
and you're feeling betrayed, but I am not gonna let you

233
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,960
就这样断绝我们的友谊
throw our friendship away.

234
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,340
我怎么可能断绝
I can't throw away something

235
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,770
从没存在过的东西
that never existed in the first place.

236
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,160
-路易  -唐娜  我们不是朋友
- Louis-- - Donna, we're not friends.

237
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,380
从来就不是  一切不过是一场谎言
We were never friends, because it was all based on a lie.

238
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,290
难道你觉得我送你这个
So you think my giving you this

239
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,220
为你做那么多事
and every other nice thing that I ever did for you

240
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,250
都只是为了防止你发现迈克的事吗
was just to keep you from finding out about Mike?

241
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,860
不  我没有这样想
No, I don't.

242
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,820
但我认为如果你有机会
But I do think if you had the chance

243
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,270
收回所有你为我做过的事
to take back all those nice things you did

244
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,310
来换取我永远不会发现你的小秘密
in exchange for me never finding out about your little secret,

245
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,760
你会眼睛都不眨就那样做
you'd do it in a heartbeat.

246
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,070
你想要有机会和我说实话
You want a chance to tell me the truth?

247
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,860
那就说吧  现在就和我说实话
Go ahead. Tell me the truth right now.

248
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,650
你的沉默就是答案了
And that answers my question.

249
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,570
你知道吗  路易
You know what, Louis?

250
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,960
这是个混蛋问题
It was a bullshit question

251
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,000
你是专门为了让我难受才说的
designed to do nothing but make me feel like shit.

252
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,990
我的目的达到了
Mission accomplished.

253
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,390
现在我对你重复我对迈克说过的话
And now I'm gonna tell you what I told Mike.

254
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,090
-你在我心目中已经死了  -好吧
- You're dead to me. - Okay.

255
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,160
你想恨我随你的便
You want to hate me? Hate me.

256
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,430
你想恨迈克也随你的便
You want to hate Mike? Hate Mike.

257
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,480
但这间律所不可能所有人在你心目中都死了
But everybody at this firm can't be dead to you,

258
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,050
因为早晚你会需要别人的帮助
because sooner or later, you're going to need someone.

259
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,230
谢谢你  唐娜
Thank you, Donna,

260
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,060
反正我不会需要你的帮助
but that someone isn't going to be you.

261
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,800
唐娜说你想见我
Donna said you wanted to see me.

262
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
不  我不是想见你
No, I didn't want to see you,

263
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,520
是需要见你
I needed to see you.

264
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,760
我知道你现在压力很大
I know you're under a lot of stress,

265
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,340
但我们不能再在这里那个了
but that was a one-time thing.

266
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,740
我不需要你帮我消耗精力
I don't need you to do that to me.

267
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,030
路易已经把我整够惨了
Louis has already done it.

268
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,130
什么意思
What are you talking about?

269
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,240
看看这个
Look at this.

270
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,010
他砸给我一大堆律师助理的工作
He's buried me in paralegal work.

271
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,900
这太过分了  他不能这样对你
Okay, that's bullshit. He can't treat you like that.

272
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,160
瑞秋  我不在乎你怎样对待我  好吗
Rachel, I don't care how he treats me, all right?

273
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,040
我能忍受他  让他撒完气
I can take it until he gets over this.

274
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,490
可看看这些截止期限
But look at these deadlines.

275
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,350
没有你的帮助我根本不可能
There's no way I can get all of this work done

276
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,530
按时完成
on time without your help.

277
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,890
你需要我干什么都可以  可是  迈克
I will do whatever you need, but, Mike,

278
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,350
如果你不让他停手他是不可能撒完气的
he is not going to get over it until you make him get over it.

279
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,000
-瑞秋  拜托  -迈克
- Rachel, please-- - Mike.

280
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,250
我们在这里那件事的第二天
The day after what happened in here happened,

281
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,760
我甩了你
I shut you out.

282
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,600
可是一周后  你来到我门前
But then, a week later, you came to my door,

283
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,480
你说你不会不争取就轻易放弃
and you said you weren't gonna let me go without a fight.

284
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,810
那不一样
That is not the same.

285
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,560
我那时候是希望你爱上我
I wanted you to fall in love with me.

286
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,870
我当时已经爱上你了  这你很清楚
I was already in love with you, and you knew it.

287
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,010
是啊  可惜的是路易不管怎么样
Yeah, well, Louis is a lot of things,

288
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,190
可并不爱我
but he's not in love with me.

289
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,610
他曾经很爱你
He used to be.

290
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,170
你只是需要让他想起这一点
You just have to make him remember that.

291
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,770
好吧  可我们还是需要
Okay, the first thing we need to do

292
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,000
先完成这些工作
is finish all of this work.

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,740
好吧
Okay.

294
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,930
除非  你的提议还有效
Unless, of course, that offer still stands.

295
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,610
我不记得我说了什么提议
I don't recall making an offer.

296
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,410
你说我需要你干什么都可以
You did say whatever I need.

297
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,710
我不是那个意思
That's not what I meant.

298
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,540
然后你又说无论什么我都不许拒绝...
And then you said never take no for an answer, so...

299
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,060
把门锁上
Lock the doors.

300
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,460
-你是认真...  -接受才是正确答案
- Are you serious-- - Take yes for an answer.

301
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,720
我马上锁门
I'm locking the door.

302
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,260
路易  你电话里说很紧急
Louis, you sounded urgent on the phone.

303
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,080
发生什么事了
What's going on?

304
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,520
我告诉你发生什么事了
I'll tell you what's going on.

305
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,310
我重回皮尔逊-斯佩克特了
I'm back at Pearson Specter.

306
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,730
什么
What?

307
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,740
我不明白
I don't understand.

308
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,280
让我解释给你听
Let me explain it to you.

309
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,030
我刚刚成为了冠名合伙人
I just became name partner.

310
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,290
路易  这太棒了
Louis, this is amazing.

311
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,210
我真为你感到高兴
I'm so happy for you.

312
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,480
好  你可以继续为我高兴
Okay, well, you can keep being happy for me,

313
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,770
但你最好也为自己感到高兴
but you better start being happy for you,

314
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,470
因为我要雇你回来
because I'm bringing you back.

315
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,810
什么  我...
What? I--oh.

316
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,610
卡特里娜·阿曼达·班尼特
Katrina Amanda Bennett,

317
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,800
你愿意来给我做律师吗
will you be my associate?

318
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,320
路易·马洛·利特
Louis Marlowe Litt,

319
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,540
我愿意做你的律师
I will be your associate.

320
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,710
做回你的律师
Again.

321
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,400
你让我成为了这世界上最幸福的律师
You've just made me the happiest attorney on earth.

322
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,500
我们什么时候开始再续这段美好前缘
When do we consummate our new preexisting relationship?

323
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,800
等我的新职位一生效就开始
As soon as my new position is official.

324
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,210
等等  为什么还没有生效
Wait, why isn't it official?

325
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,200
我不能告诉你为什么
I can't tell you that.

326
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,330
路易  我还以为我已经证明自己值得信任了
Louis, I think I've more than proven you can trust me.

327
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,170
你开什么玩笑
Oh, are you kidding me?

328
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,100
你是我唯一信任的人
You're the only one I can trust.

329
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,890
不是因为那个  只是...
It's not that. It's just--

330
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,740
好吧  路易  你不用告诉我
Okay, Louis, you don't need to tell me.

331
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,140
但如果你不能告诉我  他们也不能公布
But if you won't tell me, and they won't tell the world,

332
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,780
那一定有事情不对劲
something's wrong.

333
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,030
卡特里娜  我自有分寸
Katrina, I know what I'm doing.

334
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,830
而杰西卡也自有分寸
And Jessica knows what she's doing,

335
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,840
她能把你玩弄在鼓掌之间
which is playing you for a fool.

336
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,460
哈维  我正想给你打电话
Harvey, I was just gonna call you.

337
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,650
不用你麻烦了
I'll save you the trouble.

338
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,760
我们让路易·利特回律所了
We're bringing Louis Litt back to the firm.

339
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,790
这改变不了什么
That doesn't matter.

340
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,900
因为我正要给你打电话告诉你
Because that call was to tell you

341
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,940
我决定雇佣他  所以你欠我的
I'm hiring him, and you owe me.

342
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,310
胡扯
Bullshit.

343
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,720
你说我撒谎吗
You calling me a liar?

344
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,900
我并没有说你
I'm not calling you anything,

345
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,160
但你这是在说外面的西尔维娅说谎
but you are calling Sylvia out there a liar.

346
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,520
不不  西尔维娅一个字都不会和你说的
Oh, no, no, Sylvia wouldn't tell you shit.

347
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,480
你错了
Wrong.

348
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,840
恭维一句她的头发
One compliment about her hair,

349
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,940
她就告诉了我  你一个小时前就拒绝了路易
and she told me you gave Louis the bad news an hour ago.

350
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,460
回见  罗伯特
See you around, Robert.

351
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,130
哈维  还有一件事
Harvey, one more thing.

352
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,270
你还是欠我一个人情
You do still owe me that favor.

353
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,720
你打的是什么算盘
What kind of math are you doing?

354
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,730
我说的是杰西卡·皮尔逊
The kind of math that says Jessica Pearson

355
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,540
重新雇佣路易·利特是个黑幕
hiring Louis Litt back adds up to shady.

356
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,880
如果你只有这点证据
If that's all you've got, 

357
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,190
那每次我遭遇罢工你都能收集不少人情
you can collect your favor when the clock strikes kiss my ass,

358
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,540
因为合伙人从律所进进出出是常有的事
because partners leave firms and come back all the time.

359
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,000
也许吧  但他们的名字可上不了墙
Maybe, but they don't come back with their name on the wall.

360
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,540
看来他不应该告诉我
Ah, I'm guessing he wasn't supposed to tell me that.

361
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,800
可他说了
But he did, 

362
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,160
而路易·利特可不是冠名合伙人的料
and Louis Litt is not name partner material,

363
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,550
这意味着他肯定有你的把柄
which means he must have something on you.

364
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,980
所以除非你想让我在城里
So unless you want me going around town

365
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,040
四处散播你的家门之丑
flapping my big mouth that something isn't right in your kitchen, 

366
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,950
否则你在我需要时最好乖乖帮忙
you're gonna make good on that favor.

367
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,020
西尔维娅那不是说漏嘴  对吗
Sylvia didn't slip up at all, did she?

368
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,080
对  不是
No, she didn't.

369
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,920
你有你的得力助手  我有我的
You have your girl Friday; I have mine.

370
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,800
但你出去的时候还是可以告诉她
But you can still tell her how nice her hair looks

371
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,980
她的头发很美
on the way out.

372
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,290
我会找你的
I'll be in touch.

373
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,730
这就要放弃了吗
Oh, you're tapping out already?

374
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,740
我以为你挺有种的呢
I thought you'd have a lot more backbone than that.

375
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,220
我没有要放弃
I'm not tapping out.

376
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,730
我完成了全部工作
I finished all of the work...

377
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,350
我希望你一小时之前就完成的
Which I expected to be done an hour ago.

378
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,890
得了路易  你压根没想到我能完成
Come on, Louis, you didn't expect it to be done at all.

379
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,510
同样  你也没想到这个
Just like you didn't expect this.

380
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,130
什么鬼东西
What the hell is that?

381
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,870
礼品券
It's a gift certificate.

382
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,360
干什么  想贿赂我吗
What, are you trying to bribe me now?

383
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,870
不是贿赂  是提醒
It's not a bribe, it's a reminder.

384
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,490
你看  这是彼得的牛排馆的礼券
Look, the gift certificate is from Peter's Steak House,

385
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,530
是你和我一起救下的那家牛排馆
the place that you and I saved together.

386
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,770
我们救下它之后
And after we saved it,

387
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,000
你跟我说  我们有共同之处
you told me that we had something in common.

388
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,950
是  可我不在乎
Yeah, I don't give a shit.

389
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,680
你在乎
Yes, you do,

390
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,960
因为我们的共同之处就是
because what we had in common

391
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,530
对法律的热爱
was a love of the law.

392
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,900
你要我当你的律师时  就是这么说的  
You told me that when you asked me to be your associate,

393
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,410
路易  我还是当初那个人
Louis, and I am still the same person.

394
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,660
如果我发现  跟我合得来的女人
And if I found out a woman I had something in common with

395
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,710
其实是个男人  我可不会再跟她约会
was actually a man, I wouldn't keep seeing her.

396
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,460
好吧  可那跟我的事并不完全一样
Okay, what I did is not at all the same thing.

397
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,540
没错  你更糟
No, it's worse.

398
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,590
你说你很爱法律
You say you love the law so much,

399
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,870
可你染指的所有案子都被玷污了
but every single case you've ever touched is tainted.

400
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,760
你一旦被揭穿  彼得牛排馆就得被铲平
So you get exposed, Peter's gets bulldozed.

401
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,820
如果你我没有联手
It wouldn't even be there to get bulldozed

402
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,480
牛排馆被铲平前就不存在了
if you and I hadn't worked together.

403
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,230
好吧聪明鬼  你想一起工作吗
All right, genius. You want to work together?

404
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,030
你很爱法律吗
You love the law so much?

405
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,930
你最好记住我办过的所有案子
You're gonna memorize every case that I've ever done.

406
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,300
-路易  -不  干活儿去
- Louis. - No, get to work,

407
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,950
用你非凡的记忆
and use that magnificent memory of yours

408
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,790
干点正经事
for something more than

409
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,150
别在这儿荒废人生
bullshitting your way through life.

410
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,490
我们有个麻烦
We have a problem.

411
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,420
除非是紧急事务  否则我没时间
Unless it's urgent, I don't have the time.

412
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,110
路易跟别人说了
Louis is telling people.

413
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,230
谁
What people?

414
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,590
目前为止是罗伯特·赞恩
For starters, Robert Zane.

415
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,590
路易居然会跟罗伯特·赞恩说话
Why the hell is Louis even talking to Robert Zane?

416
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,950
我们夺回回春制药之后我求他雇佣路易
I asked him to hire Louis after we took back VersaLife.

417
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,810
而你到现在才告诉我
And you didn't think to tell me that after last night?

418
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,040
那时我一直掌握着大局
I was handling it.

419
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,830
那我告诉你  你掌握得糟透了
From what I can tell, you handled it like shit.

420
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,050
这是我的错吗
So this is my fault?

421
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,210
反正肯定不是我的错
Well, it sure as hell isn't mine.

422
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,860
杰西卡  
You know what, Jessica, 

423
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,660
可不是我想解雇路易的
I'm not the one who wanted to fire Louis,

424
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
也不是我想霸占他的客户
and I'm not the one who wanted to deny him clients.

425
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,240
我解雇他是因为他作为律师表现不好
I did that because of his performance as an attorney.

426
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,270
而你这么多年跟他不和只为自己高兴
You antagonized him for years for your own pleasure.

427
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,630
别自欺欺人了
Tell yourself whatever you want.

428
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,100
你也欺负过他
You handed out your share of abuse.

429
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,080
你才不要自欺欺人了
Tell yourself whatever you want.

430
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,520
是你雇了一个骗子  给了路易筹码
You're the one who hired a fraud and gave Louis leverage.

431
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,130
我也跟你说过路易会得寸进尺的
And I told you Louis would get worse,

432
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,260
而你说我必须承受
and you said I had to take it.

433
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,830
我不在乎是谁的错
Well, I don't care whose fault it is,

434
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,200
他现在得寸进尺了  我不要承受这些
he is getting worse, and I'm not gonna take it.

435
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,750
你必须承受
Oh, yes, you are.

436
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,240
你不但要承受
You're going to take it,

437
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,270
还要微笑着承受
and you're gonna do it with a smile on your face

438
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,010
直到我说够了
until I say otherwise.

439
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,250
你要干什么
And what the hell are you gonna do?

440
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,070
我去收拾烂摊子  一劳永逸
I'm going to clean up this mess once and for all.

441
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,210
你说没有镶钻名片是什么意思
What do you mean, you don't have diamond-encrusted business cards?

442
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,080
好吧  象牙浮雕的呢
Fine, what about the embossed ivory?

443
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,550
很好  一万张要多少钱
Okay, great, well, how much would 10,000 of those run me?

444
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,910
钱不是问题
Money's no object.

445
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,450
什么  你疯了吗  我才不会付那么多钱
What, are you crazy? I'm not paying that much.

446
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,660
除非它有镶边
Unless it comes with a reach-around.

447
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,430
可是我还是不会付那么多钱
Which, by the way, I'm still not paying that much.

448
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,130
精英印刷个鬼
Elite Printing, my ass.

449
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,990
我给你一个简单的指令
I give you one simple instruction...

450
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,890
让你把嘴闭好  你连那个都做不到
to keep your mouth shut...and you couldn't even do that.

451
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,290
好吧  你跟诺玛预约过吗
Um, okay, did you make an appointment with Norma?

452
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,550
-约什么  -和我会见
- What? - To see me.

453
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,200
你跟我的秘书诺玛约了吗
Did you check with my secretary, Norma?

454
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,400
省省吧  路易  我没心情玩这个
Cut the shit, Louis. I'm not in the mood.

455
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,980
那就培养一下心情  因为我才是握着底牌的人
Well, get in the mood, because I hold all the cards.

456
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,730
这些底牌可以换来你的名字上墙
And those cards are getting you your name on the wall,

457
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,730
可你不能四处宣扬
but you need to keep this to yourself.

458
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,250
为什么
Why?

459
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,420
让你就能想办法搞倒我吗
So you can figure out a way to screw me?

460
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,940
我向你承诺过
I gave you my word.

461
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,520
我不想失礼  杰西卡  但你的承诺一分不值
Well, no disrespect, Jessica, but your word means shit.

462
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,870
所以如果你不想让我宣扬
So if you want me to stop telling people,

463
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,360
那你最好替我去宣扬
you better start telling people yourself.

464
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,030
我说过  适当的时候会的
I told you, in good time.

465
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,350
我也说过  爷等不了
And I just told you I don't give a shit.

466
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,030
所以我建议你召集高级合伙人会议
So I suggest you call a meeting with the senior partners.

467
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,520
高级合伙人会议是在每周四
Those meetings are on Thursdays.

468
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,690
今天就是周四
Well, consider today Thursday.

469
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,490
我说过  我得想想怎么说让人接受
I told you, I have yet to figure out how to sell it.

470
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,230
你想知道怎么说  我来告诉你怎么说
You want to sell it? I'll tell you how to sell it.

471
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,030
你和哈维一起说
You and Harvey do it together,

472
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,990
真心真意地说  现在马上去说
you do it like you mean it. And you do it now.

473
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,900
懂了吗  很好
Got it? Good.

474
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,550
我想你们都听说了
I'm sure you've all heard rumors

475
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,530
有关我们召集这次会议原因的流言
about why we called this meeting,

476
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,510
而有流言是因为好消息要保密总是很难
but that's because it's hard to keep good news quiet.

477
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,650
本周稍迟些  我们会正式宣布
We'll be making this official later this week

478
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,570
但在此我要宣布我们有了新的命名合伙人
but we're here to announce our newest name partner,

479
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,490
路易·利特
Louis Litt.

480
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,770
谢谢  杰西卡
Thank you, Jessica.

481
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,530
哈维
Harvey.

482
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,330
也许有人想知道事情的原委
Some of you may be wondering how this happened.

483
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,320
解释很简单
There's a simple explanation,

484
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,820
对我来说就是承认一些事  那就是...
and all it requires is for me to admit something.

485
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,120
我犯了个错误
I made a mistake.

486
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,100
我不该接受路易的辞呈
I never should have accepted Louis's resignation,

487
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,170
不只因为他很会赚钱
because not only is he a billing machine

488
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,490
还因为他是位出色的律师
and a damn good attorney,

489
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,220
他私下还数次帮助过我解决麻烦
he has personally gotten me out of more than one jam,

490
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,640
除了我的朋友路易·利特  我不愿别人的名字
and there's no one I'd rather have my name next to

491
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,630
摆在我的旁边
than my friend Louis Litt.

492
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,060
谢谢你  哈维
Thank you, Harvey.

493
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,200
虽然现在还是"非正式"的  可我已经觉得
Even though it's "Not official," I already feel like

494
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,290
我的名字镶在墙上和你们一样久了
my name's been up there as long as yours.

495
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,360
我也真心觉得
And I definitely feel like

496
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,540
我的名字会镶在墙上很久  很久
it's gonna be up there for a long, long time.

497
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,050
会开得真是有用啊
A lot of good that did.

498
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,520
就让路易在他的重要时刻耍混蛋吧
Leave it to Louis to take his big moment like a dick.

499
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,420
哈维  冷静
Harvey, calm down.

500
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,090
冷静
Calm down?

501
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,890
我所说的正是他期待的
I just did exactly what he wanted,

502
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,970
而他却表现得像个混蛋  还会继续混下去
and he acted like a dick, and he's not gonna stop.

503
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,150
他不会罢休是因为你没有做他期待的事
He's not gonna stop because you didn't do what he wanted.

504
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,860
杰西卡  我刚刚在全体合伙人面前
Jessica, I just got up there and kissed his ass

505
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,270
帮他卖乖
in front of the entire partnership

506
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,470
还得假装很乐意
and pretended to like it.

507
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,520
没错
Exactly.

508
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,700
假装
Pretended.

509
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,170
你想让我真心乐意不成
Oh, you want me to actually like it?

510
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,270
我要你让他感受到  自己被接受了
I want you to make him feel accepted.

511
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,940
杰西卡
Jessica.

512
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,210
哈维  路易想要的是被接受
Harvey, what Louis wants is to be accepted.

513
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,320
无论你是否喜欢
And like it or not, 

514
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,140
他最想看到的是被你接受
the person he wants that from the most is you.

515
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,060
所以你去找他  要非常友好友好
So you're gonna go to him, you're gonna make nice,

516
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,460
这就是我们收拾烂摊子的方法
and that's how we're gonna put all of this to bed.

517
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,970
有人能解释刚才搞什么飞机吗
You want to tell me what the hell that was?

518
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,870
请允许我失陪一下
If you'll excuse me,

519
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,920
让杰西卡解释吧
I'm gonna let Jessica handle this conversation.

520
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,930
我要去死一死了
I have to go kill myself.

521
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,990
杰夫  现在不是时候
Jeff, I can't do this right now.

522
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,360
我应该预约个时间吗
Should I make an appointment?

523
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,430
因为合伙人也许相信了路易胜利回归
Because the partners may have bought that fairy tale

524
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,190
这种美丽童话
about Louis's triumphant return, 

525
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,310
可我比他们了解的更多
but they don't know what I know.

526
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,300
你知道什么
What exactly is that?

527
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,290
我知道路易犯罪了
That Louis committed a crime,

528
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,550
随后在你要解雇他之前的五秒钟
and then he resigned five seconds

529
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,270
他辞了职
before you were about to fire him.

530
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,710
现在他不仅回来了  还成了冠名合伙人
And now he's not only back, he's name partner.

531
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,940
我重新考虑了
I reconsidered, 

532
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,920
作为经营合伙人  我有权这么做
which, as managing partner, i am entitled to do.

533
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,680
作为一个有头脑的人
And as someone with a brain, 

534
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,060
我有权就此认为路易掌握了你的把柄
I'm entitled to come to the conclusion that Louis has something on you.

535
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,040
杰夫  你说不希望我再骗你
Jeff, you said you didn't want me to lie to you anymore,

536
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,580
我也尽力不骗你
and I'm trying like hell not to.

537
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,010
你现在的作为跟骗我没两样
And that's the same thing as lying to me.

538
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,890
不  这不一样
No, it's not.

539
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,230
你真是一个该死的律师
Oh, you are one hell of a lawyer.

540
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,670
你也是  所以你才会在这里
So are you, which is why you're here.

541
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,220
我跟你坦白
So I'll come clean.

542
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,960
但我不能告诉你事情的真相
I can't tell you the truth about this,

543
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,520
目前我只能诚实至此了
and that's as honest as I can be with you right now.

544
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,250
你能接受吗
Can you handle that?

545
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,130
现在可以
I can handle it for now.

546
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,460
但我不能永远被蒙在鼓里
But I won't handle it forever.

547
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,990
路易  你在这里做什么
Louis, what are you doing here?

548
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,210
我发现到你还没恭喜我呢
I noticed you haven't congratulated me yet,

549
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,230
所以我想给你个机会补说一下
so I wanted to give you a chance to make up for it.

550
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,450
好吧  恭喜你  我们都为你高兴
Right, congratulations. We're all so happy for you.

551
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,370
这就是你要的吗
Is that what you wanted?

552
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,260
你似乎有点不真诚
Seemed a little disingenuous.

553
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,670
那我就实话实说了
Then let me be clear.

554
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,530
我一点也不为此高兴
I don't mean a word of it.

555
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,190
你真想用这种口气对冠名合伙人说话吗
You really want to talk that way to a new name partner?

556
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,730
你用这种口气对你说话
I'm talking to you that way

557
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,990
是因为你靠威胁把我爱的人关进监狱
because you threatened to throw the man that I love in jail

558
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,590
才成了冠名合伙人
to become that name partner.

559
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,730
所以  路易
So, you know what, Louis,

560
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,340
我真是抱歉没给你烤个蛋糕
I'm sorry that I didn't bake you a cake.

561
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,400
那真是糟糕
That's too bad.

562
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,540
你没给我什么礼物
You didn't do anything for me,

563
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,180
我却给你准备了
but I got something for you.

564
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,380
文件复审
Doc review.

565
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,260
整理成一式三份
Filings to be done in triplicate.

566
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,640
既然你喜欢律师助理的工作  我就让你做
Paralegal work, since you like doing it so much.

567
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,560
你知道我根本不爱做这些
You know I don't like doing it at all.

568
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,790
你帮你的男朋友做过啊
You helped your boyfriend with his work.

569
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,200
你觉得我会不知道吗
You didn't think I'd figure that out?

570
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,130
你知道  我不在乎
You know what? I don't care.

571
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,840
你没有权利管我
You have no authority over me.

572
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,160
我是哈维的初级律师
I'm Harvey's associate.

573
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,010
没错  但我管所有的初级律师
Yeah, but I run the associates.

574
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,020
所以  我也管得着你
Therefore, I run you.

575
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,550
我知道你在做什么
I know what you're doing.

576
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,270
但你知道你自己在做什么吗
But do you know what you're doing?

577
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,690
你不仅仅和一个骗子一起生活
Not only do you live with a fraud,

578
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,830
你还像他一样...
you're just like him--

579
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,780
假装自己是个律师
pretending to be a lawyer when you're not.

580
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,900
我才没有假装
I'm not pretending to be anything.

581
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,140
我在读法学院
I am in law school.

582
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,300
你真的能读完吗
Are you really gonna make it through?

583
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,970
你连法学院入学考试都是勉强通过
You could barely handle the LSATs.

584
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,480
根本上不了哈佛
You couldn't get into Harvard.

585
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,940
老实说  虽然你的男朋友是个骗子
As a matter of fact, your boyfriend may be a fraud,

586
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,800
但他作律师  比你这辈子能达到的程度都高
but he's a better lawyer than you'll ever be.

587
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,540
你根本不知道我做律师能到什么程度
You have no idea what kind of lawyer I'm gonna be.

588
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,420
是吗
Don't I?

589
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,400
你师从身边最好的骗子  瑞秋
You learned from the best liars around, Rachel

590
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,540
哈维  迈克
Harvey, Mike,

591
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,280
你的父亲
your father.

592
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,490
我当然知道你能到什么程度
Yeah, I know exactly the kind of lawyer you're gonna be.

593
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,250
但在那之前 
But until that day, 

594
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,940
你还是最适合做这种工作
this kind of work is all you're good for.

595
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,930
你喜欢吃腌过的肉
So you like marinated meat?

596
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,570
好吃
Oh, yum.

597
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,270
等等  你做哪种
Okay, wait, but which one do you make?

598
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,670
堪萨斯城风格还是孟菲斯特色
Kansas City or Memphis style?

599
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,710
说到肋排
Oh, hell, when it comes to ribs,

600
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,520
我变尽花样去做啊
I make 'em every which way I can.

601
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,920
我现在真的饿了
I am now officially starving.

602
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,320
-哈维  -请坐
- Harvey. - Please have a seat.

603
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,580
别让我的工作影响你的咖啡小聚
Don't let my law firm get in the way of your coffee klatch.

604
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,220
别别  别责怪唐娜
Oh, now, now, don't blame Donna here.

605
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,130
我告诉她我和你还有些没谈完的事
I told her you and I had some unfinished business.

606
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,240
是吗
Already?

607
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,920
什么  你又挑了什么制式化的案件给我
What, did you pick something out of your generic favor file?

608
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,400
我从来不做制式化的事
I've never done anything generic in my life.

609
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,810
这是特别为你定制的
This favor is tailor-made for you.

610
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,980
非常特别也非常个性
It's very specific and very personal.

611
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,010
我们与另外一家公司有点小争议
We're in a little dispute with another firm.

612
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,880
我需要你让他们别闹了
I need you to get them to back off of it.

613
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,260
为什么你不自己做呢
Why can't you do it yourself?

614
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,940
因为我不认识对方的律师
'Cause I don't know the lawyer on the other side.

615
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,000
你认识  祝你好运
You do. Good luck.

616
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,620
他在说什么
What the hell is he talking about?

617
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,450
-是斯科特  -见鬼
- It's Scottie. - Aw, shit.

618
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,120
我明白
I know.

619
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,700
斯科特不会帮我这个忙的
Scottie doesn't do favors like this,

620
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,030
我也没有什么筹码让她帮忙
and I don't have any leverage on her.

621
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,380
你有
Yeah, you do.

622
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,970
你只是不想用罢了
You're just not gonna like using it.

623
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,090
你在这里
Hey, there you are.

624
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,660
我刚背完了路易的所有案件
Look, I just finished memorizing all of Louis's cases,

625
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,450
我想可以让你...
and I had an idea I wanted to run by--

626
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,920
瑞秋  怎么了
Rachel, what happened?

627
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,930
没事
Nothing happened.

628
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,010
路易做什么了
What did Louis do?

629
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,880
没事
It's nothing.

630
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,820
他发现我帮你做事
He found out that I helped you,

631
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,610
现在他给我分配了律师助理的工作
and now he's giving me paralegal work,

632
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,690
我有点沮丧但没事
and I was a little upset, but now I'm okay.

633
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,810
你可不只是一点沮丧
You weren't just a little upset.

634
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,590
你刚才哭过
You were crying,

635
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,140
你不会为律师助理的工作而哭的
and a little paralegal work wouldn't do that.

636
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,200
这无关紧要
It is not important.

637
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,080
你知道吗  是我自找苦吃
And you know what? I had it coming.

638
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,070
你自找苦吃
You had it coming?

639
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,780
你怎么了...瑞秋  他做了什么
What are you-- Rachel, what did he do?

640
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,280
迈克  是我叫你与他和解
Mike, I was the one that told you to make up with him.

641
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,590
-瑞秋  -我帮了你做事
- Rachel. - I helped you with the work.

642
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,730
-他究竟做了什么  -你知道吗
- What did he do? - And you know what?

643
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,920
我骗他的次数不比你少
I lied to him as much as you did.

644
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,260
他做了什么
What did he do?

645
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,440
他没有对我做什么  是他说的话
It's not what he did, it's what he said.

646
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,970
他说了什么
What did he say?

647
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,440
迈克  我不是小女孩了
Mike, I'm a big girl,

648
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,900
我可以处理路易的事
and I can take care of Louis.

649
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,930
这不仅是你的事
This isn't about you,

650
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,490
还关系着我和他
this is about me and him,

651
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,380
我会让他记住的
and I'm gonna make him remember that.

652
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,950
你这该死的东西
You piece of shit.

653
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,280
你说这只是我和你之间的事
You said this was between me and you.

654
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,140
确实是我和你的事
It is between me and you.

655
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,530
不  当你找瑞秋麻烦
No, it stopped being between me and you

656
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,050
这事就不仅是我俩的事了
the second you went to Rachel.

657
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:01,920
你找她帮忙的那一刻
You put her between us

658
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,240
就把她拉进来了
the second you went to her to help you.

659
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,550
天啊  你疯了吗
God, are you insane?

660
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,400
瑞秋一向对你很好
Rachel has never been anything but kind to you.

661
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,960
我都算不过来
I can't even count the amount of times

662
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:09,880
她帮你说话的次数了
that she defended you.

663
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,800
现在她就想帮我一点忙
And now, she tries to help me just a little bit,

664
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,710
你就把她大卸八块
and you rip her to pieces.

665
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,300
不  我说的不是今天的事  骗子
No, that's not the help I'm talking about, fraud.

666
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,000
那你在说什么
Then what the hell are you talking about?

667
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,750
你找她帮你为你的身份圆谎
You went to her to help you lie to me about who you are,

668
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,800
她这个小狗腿就屁颠屁颠
and like the good little lackey that she is,

669
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,430
跑到我面前对我撒谎
she came to me and lied to my face.

670
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,830
她这么做是为了保护我  路易
She did it to protect me, Louis.

671
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,690
那敢情好
Well, good for you,

672
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,730
但我发现了这件事
but when I found out about it,

673
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,640
我觉得恶心透顶了
I felt like shit for the 180th time.

674
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,550
所以我就以彼之道还之彼身了
So I just went to her and did the same thing.

675
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,120
路易  我刚背完
You know, Louis, I've just been memorizing

676
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,770
你以前所有的辩词
all of your old arguments.

677
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,600
我本来打算试试在这里
I was actually gonna try and come in here

678
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,040
引用一些来改变你对我的印象
and use one of them to change your mind about me.

679
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,620
-没用的  -我知道
- It won't work. - Oh, I know.

680
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,720
因为我还是原来的那个我
Because while I am the same person that I was before,

681
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,090
而你却变了
you're not.

682
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,400
你没说错
You're right.

683
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,380
我不是原来那个我了
I'm not the same person.

684
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,840
我原来是个言出必行的人
I used to be a man of my word,

685
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,670
但你们这些人却让我懂得那没有意义
but you people taught me that doesn't mean a thing.

686
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,320
所以当我告诉你
So when I told you

687
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,430
这只是你和我的事  我骗了你
it was between me and you, I lied.

688
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,840
我发现了你的弱点
I found your weak spot,

689
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,250
你知道我打算怎么做吗
and you know what I'm gonna do?

690
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,620
我打算继续打击她
I'm gonna keep hammering on her

691
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,410
直到你崩溃
until you break.

692
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,620
杰西卡
Jessica.

693
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,790
拜托  这事能不能等等  我累坏了
Please, if it can wait, I've had a long day,

694
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,060
得回家休息
and I need to go home.

695
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,020
真糟糕
Too bad.

696
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,910
你留在这里
You're staying here

697
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,590
起草路易·利特的新合伙人协议
and drafting Louis Litt's new partnership agreement.

698
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,470
你现在也要落井下石了吗
So now you're piling on too now?

699
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,090
我没落井下石
I'm not piling on.

700
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,770
我给你这个是因为这活不能计费
I am giving you this because it's non-billable work

701
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,730
而且这件事也是因你而起
and the only reason it exists is because of you.

702
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,290
又来了
This again?

703
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,740
你说什么
Excuse me?

704
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,860
你听得很清楚
You heard me.

705
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,320
我以前看过这出戏
I've seen this movie before.

706
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,540
但它之所以重复在上演
And the reason it keeps rerunning

707
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,470
是因为每次我认为我摆脱你了
is because every time I think I'm done with you,

708
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,210
你和你的肮脏秘密就又冒出来
you and your dirty little secret rear your ugly heads.

709
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,030
你知道吗  杰西卡
You know what, Jessica?

710
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,510
我受够你
I have had it up to here

711
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,000
一直说这是我的肮脏秘密了
with you saying that this is my dirty little secret.

712
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,690
你刚发现这件事时就可以解雇我  但你没有
You could have fired me when you found out, and you didn't.

713
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,400
你没有  你决定让我留下来
No, you decided to keep me around

714
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,440
因为你更加想要
because you were more concerned

715
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,740
打倒丹尼尔·哈德曼延续你的权力
with beating Daniel Hardman and keeping your power.

716
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,320
之后你再一次选择让我留下
And then you kept me around

717
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,830
因为你不想失去哈维
because you didn't want to lose Harvey.

718
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,250
然后你想利用我的秘密牵制哈维
And then you wanted to use my secret to beat Harvey,

719
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,300
之后就是一次又一次的重复
and then again and again and again.

720
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,350
所以杰西卡  你能不能告诉我
So please, Jessica, why don't you tell me,

721
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,460
这件事什么时候才能成为你的肮脏秘密
when the hell does this become your dirty little secret?

722
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,060
这里有人了吗
This seat taken?

723
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,540
你好
Hi.

724
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,350
你好
Hey.

725
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,890
鉴于你的信息写的很含蓄
Since your message was so cryptic,

726
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,390
我猜是关于公事的
I'm assuming this is about business.

727
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,380
我需要你帮忙
I need a favor.

728
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,260
斯科特
Hey, Scottie.

729
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,270
你还好吗
How are you?

730
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,210
你离开之后过得怎么样
How have you been since you left?

731
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,170
我听说你休息了一阵子
I heard that you took some time off.

732
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,310
你去哪里了
Where did you land?

733
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,820
我希望你能和罗伯特·赞恩和解
I need you to settle your case against Robert Zane.

734
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,260
我为什么要那么做
And why would I do that?

735
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,430
因为我欠他一个人情
Because I owe him one.

736
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,050
哈维  我刚刚在这家新公司落脚
Harvey, I'm just getting back on my feet at a new firm.

737
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,930
这个案子赢面很大
This case is winnable.

738
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,210
公司也知道这个情况因为我告诉他们了
The firm knows that it is because I told them it is.

739
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,960
我和解了  会看起来很糟
I settle, I look like shit.

740
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,580
我知道  但你曾经来找我
I know that, but you came to me once

741
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,540
让我放过福尔松食品公司
to take it easy on you with Folsom Foods--

742
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,560
因为你说过如果我遇到私事上的麻烦
Because you said if I was ever in trouble personally--

743
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,190
我确实遇到了私事上的麻烦
I am in trouble personally.

744
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,150
你和罗伯特·赞恩有什么私人恩怨
What the hell is personal about Robert Zane?

745
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,520
如果你不帮我
You don't do this for me,

746
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,670
赞恩就会知道迈克·罗斯的秘密
Zane's going to put it together about Mike Ross.

747
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,930
你这个自私的混蛋
You selfish son of a bitch.

748
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,980
你说你之所以告诉我这件事
You said you told me that

749
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,560
是因为你不想一直对自己爱的人撒谎
because you didn't want to keep lying to the people you love.

750
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,140
我确实不想
I didn't want to.

751
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,660
但你现在来找我  用我知道的事
And now you come to me trading on the fact that I know

752
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,440
来换取摆脱因你的自私和愚蠢才陷入的困境
to get you out of a jam for doing something stupid and selfish

753
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,550
而这个窘境还断送了
that drove a wedge between us

754
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,600
我们最初在一起的机会
before we ever even had a chance.

755
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,630
我告诉你了真相
I told you the truth.

756
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,040
但那时已经太迟了
After it was too late.

757
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,020
斯科特
Scottie.

758
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,980
我那么爱你
I loved you.

759
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,520
我那么爱你
I loved you,

760
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,160
但你却让一些我绝不会讲出去的愚蠢秘密
and you let some stupid secret that I would never tell anyone

761
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,610
阻碍了我们的关系  因为你无法信任我
come between us because you couldn't trust me with it.

762
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,990
你说得对  斯科特
You're right, Scottie.

763
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,600
我确实没有立场求你帮忙
I don't have a leg to stand on.

764
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,400
但如果你不帮我  我就会有麻烦
But if you don't do this for me, I am in trouble.

765
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,630
我会提议和罗伯特·赞恩和解
I'm going to recommend we settle with Robert Zane.

766
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,430
谢谢你
Thank you.

767
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,390
但事先跟你说清楚
But to be clear,

768
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,600
你只能这样拜托我一次
you get to ask me this once.

769
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,200
我再也不想听到迈克·罗斯这个名字了
And I never want to hear the name Mike Ross again.

770
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,940
斯科特
Scottie--

771
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,810
就一次
Once.

772
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,230
{\an8}皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特

773
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,960
你想要正式
You wanted it to be official.

774
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,400
如你所愿了  路易
There it is, Louis.

775
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,410
这就正式了
It's official.

776
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,500
所以就这样了
So that's it?

777
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,420
人们明早就会像往常一样走进来
People are just gonna walk in here tomorrow morning

778
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,910
有可能看到  有可能看不到
like it's any other day and see it or maybe not see it?

779
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,870
那你还想怎么样
What were you expecting?

780
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,800
一个庆典外加管乐队吗
A ceremony and a brass band?

781
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,740
那不是我们的风格
We don't do that.

782
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,370
我是冠名合伙人  我就要那样做
Well, I'm name partner, and I say we do now.

783
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,150
你说什么
Excuse me?

784
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:37,940
你听到了
You heard me.

785
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,410
我要公开有排场的庆祝
I want pomp and circumstance in the form of an unveiling.

786
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,670
我要回家了  路易
I'm going home, Louis.

787
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,180
我不会将今晚剩下的时间用来
I'm not spending the rest of the night

788
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,320
给大家发送邀请邮件的
emailing invitations to an unveiling.

789
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,150
你要回家了
You're going home?

790
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,770
那我自己给他们发
Well, then I'll send them out myself.

791
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,110
因为明天
Because tomorrow...

792
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
我就要那样做
this is happening.

793
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,370
下午四点整
4 P.M. sharp.

794
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,530
我四点有个会
I have a meeting at 4:00.

795
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,600
那就重新安排时间
Then reschedule it.

796
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,000
你不是想我重新安排时间
You don't want me to reschedule.

797
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,380
你想要的是确定自己配得上这一切
What you want is to know you've earned that.

798
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,330
我配得上
I have earned it,

799
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,590
但我希望你知道这一点
but I want you to know it.

800
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,900
好吧  这样说吧
Okay, here it is.

801
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,960
你的名字在上面是因为你找到了一个把柄
You got your name up there by finding leverage

802
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,080
并且用它威胁我做了一些
and using it to strong-arm me into doing something

803
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,580
我绝不会做的事情
that I never would have done.

804
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,470
听着  我了解你
See, I knew you--

805
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,110
让我说完
Let me finish.

806
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,230
这个举动太过无情
It was a stone-cold move,

807
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,720
而且这正是哈维会做的事
and it's exactly what Harvey would have done.

808
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,990
如果这还不能让你知道你配得上这一切
Now, if that doesn't tell you that you've earned it,

809
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,550
那我也不知道什么能了
then I don't know what will.

810
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,520
你还想让我把会议改期吗
You still want me to reschedule my meeting?

811
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,420
是的
Yes, I do.

812
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,670
好吧  我会去的
Fine. I'll be there.

813
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,450
你和哈维一起
You and Harvey.

814
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,590
当然了  路易
Of course, Louis.

815
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,640
我们是你的合伙人
We're your partners.

816
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,290
天哪  你看起来糟透了
Jesus, you look like shit.

817
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,210
发生了什么
What's going on?

818
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,110
为了给杰西卡起草路易的合伙人协议
Between drafting Louis's partnership agreement

819
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,630
同时忍受路易无休止的攻击
for Jessica and Louis's never-ending onslaught,

820
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,160
我一晚没睡
I didn't get any sleep.

821
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,580
那去洗把脸吧
Well, splash some water on your face,

822
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,300
因为我们还要装作很在意的
'cause we have to go to his debutante ball

823
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,560
去参加个名媛成年舞会
and look like we give a shit.

824
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,820
不  我不去
No. I'm not going.

825
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,790
什么叫你不去
What do you mean you're not going?

826
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,530
现在不是激怒他的时候
Now is not the time to poke the bear.

827
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,360
太迟了
It's too late.

828
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,780
他就是个混蛋
The bear is an asshole,

829
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,550
他也不只是在拿我撒气了
and he's not just taking it out on me anymore.

830
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,030
-他还在针对瑞秋  -什么
- He's taking it out on Rachel. - What?

831
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,000
是的  他讲的很清楚他找到了我的弱点
Yeah, he made it clear that he found the weak spot

832
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,690
这招对我很有效
that's going to get to me, 

833
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,440
而且他会一直不断地施压
and he's gonna keep pressing it and pressing it

834
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,080
直到我受不了为止
until I can't take it anymore.

835
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,900
迈克  你不能再招惹他了
Mike, you are not ringing that bell.

836
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,690
你说的对  我是不能惹他
You're damn right I'm not ringing that bell.

837
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,140
但如果我必须去对那个混蛋举杯致敬
But if I have to go raise a glass to that son of a bitch,

838
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,470
我一定会把杯子敲在他脑袋上的
I'm gonna end up smashing it over his head.

839
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,680
跟我来
Come with me.

840
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,790
你想干什么
What are you going to do?

841
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,960
我受够了
Enough is enough.

842
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,110
哈维  你来的正好
Harvey. You're just in time.

843
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,070
杰西卡正带着合伙人协议过来呢
Jessica's on her way down with the partnership agreement.

844
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,990
你是来当见证人的吗
You here to be my witness?

845
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,210
他来是为了阻止我把你的脑袋扯下来
He's here to keep me from ripping your face off.

846
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,770
我懂了  既然大哥来了
Oh, I see. Now that big brother's here--

847
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,820
够了  别闹了
Okay, that's enough.

848
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,840
路易  你得到了想要的一切
Louis, you got everything you wanted,

849
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,470
你不应该再拿他出气了
and you are done taking it out on him,

850
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,110
因为不管你做什么  我都不会让他辞职的
because no matter what you do, I'm not letting him quit.

851
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,780
-那我就直接解雇他  -你不能
- Then I'll just fire him. - You can't.

852
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,190
我能  并且我会的
I can, and I will,

853
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,440
因为杰西卡宁愿让他被解雇
because Jessica would rather he be fired

854
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,830
也不愿让你们都进监狱
than you all go to jail.

855
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,000
没人要进监狱
No one's going to jail.

856
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,700
听到吗  她明白现在的状况
See? She knows what's what.

857
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,780
我签了协议  他就完蛋了
I sign the agreement, he's done,

858
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,980
然后我把卡特里娜带回来做我的律师
and then I bring Katrina back as my associate.

859
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,540
那不可能
And that's not going to happen.

860
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,790
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

861
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,880
路易  你已经把你最后一个要求用在
Louis, I'm afraid you've made your last dictate to me 

862
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,860
冠名合伙人上了
as name partner.

863
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,840
我不会让你把它从我这里夺走的
I'm not gonna let you take this away from me.

864
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,540
我没有要夺走你的任何东西
I'm not taking anything away from you.

865
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,160
你还是冠名合伙人
You are still name partner.

866
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,530
但你要先把这个签了
Right after you sign this.

867
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,660
我在你起草的版本上又加了一些东西
I added a little something extra after you finished drafting it.

868
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,280
这上写我是雇佣冒牌货的共谋者
This says I'm coconspirator to hiring a fraud.

869
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,130
你是的
You are.

870
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,210
成为冠名合伙人后
You became one

871
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,470
一旦你利用这件事  你就成了共谋者
the second you used him to get your name on the door.

872
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,970
我知道我不是真正的律师
I know I'm not a real lawyer,

873
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,970
但在我看来他是共谋者
but that sounds like he is to me.

874
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,300
我是律师
I am a real lawyer.

875
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,190
他就是共谋
He is.

876
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,780
我不签
I'm not signing it.

877
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,970
路易  事情是这样的
Louis, here's the thing.

878
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,150
我让你把这事告诉任何人
I told you not to tell anybody about this,

879
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,610
但你却跑去告诉了罗伯特·赞恩
and then you went and you shouted it to Robert Zane,

880
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,150
之后又强迫我告诉合伙人们
and then you made me tell the partners.

881
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,570
现状是  有上百人等着
And the capper is, there are about a hundred people

882
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,770
在你安排的揭幕式之后
waiting to greet you

883
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,140
来向你致意
after the unveiling you arranged,

884
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,030
但你不签字  那些就不会发生
which won't happen if you don't sign that.

885
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,550
我还是可以去报案
I could still go to the police.

886
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,670
你可以  但你不会去
Yeah, you could, but you won't.

887
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,870
因为你利用那个小秘密
'Cause you used that little secret

888
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,750
走到了今天这步
to get where you are right now.

889
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,030
那是你枪膛里唯一一颗子弹
It was the only bullet in your chamber,

890
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,500
而我要把你的枪拿走
and I am taking your gun away.

891
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,740
你给我下套
You set me up.

892
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,640
是你自己给自己下的套
You set yourself up,

893
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,350
就像你跟查尔斯·傅滋曼的交易一样
just like you did with Charles Forstman.

894
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,960
我从他那学到的
And what I learned from him 

895
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,690
就是一旦你得到想要的东西
was once you get something that you want,

896
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,050
就会不记代价地保护它
you will do whatever it takes to keep it.

897
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,360
所以你何不赶紧签字
So why don't you go ahead and sign

898
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,750
我们就可以开始你该死的欢迎派对了
so we can get out to your goddamn party.

899
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,870
非常有意思的事
You know, it's funny.

900
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,490
我们从没有为更名而开过庆典
We've never had a ceremony when we've changed names before,

901
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,040
但路易·利特竟大胆地把大家召集起来了
but Louis Litt had the audacity to convene us all here today.

902
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,570
而事实证明
And as it turns out, 

903
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,580
他作为冠名合伙人的第一个决定非常英明
his first decision as name partner is brilliant,

904
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,950
因为这样的庆典给了我们一个机会
because a ceremony like this gives us a chance

905
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:07,820
让我们重新审视我们的位置和前途
to reevaluate where we've been and where we're going.

906
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,240
也许你与同事意见不合
Perhaps you had a disagreement with a colleague,

907
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,960
或者你心里还想着别的事
or there's some other issue that's been on your mind.

908
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,660
但重点是  新的名字带来新的开始
The point is, with a new name comes a new beginning.

909
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,450
就我而言  我希望大家把这看成一个机会
For me, I'm hoping we can see this as a chance

910
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,560
把往事一笔勾销
to wipe the slate clean.

911
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,680
说到这
With that said,

912
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,890
敬我们最新的冠名合伙人吧  路易·利特
here's to our newest name partner, Louis Litt.

913
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,810
说得好
Nice speech.

914
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,500
但愿值得吧
Let's hope it takes.

915
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,020
还是有希望的
It's got a better chance of taking

916
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,030
毕竟你让他签了协议
now that you made him sign the agreement.

917
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,320
是这样
That it does.

918
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,140
说到这个
Speaking of which,

919
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,570
你什么时候想出协议的事的
when exactly did you know you were gonna do that?

920
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,300
大概在唐娜告诉我他知道之后15秒吧
about 15 seconds after Donna told me he knew.

921
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,220
你完全没觉得应该让我参与计划吗
And you didn't feel the need to bring me in on that plan?

922
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,680
我的感觉恰恰相反
I felt the exact opposite.

923
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,760
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

924
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,010
哈维  路易想看你难过
Harvey, Louis wanted to see you suffer.

925
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,040
如果我告诉你  你就得装难过
If I had told you, you would have had to fake it,

926
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,340
但你演技太差了
and you're a shitty actor.

927
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,550
拜托  我能演
Excuse me, but I can act.

928
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,780
不  谁都觉得自己能演  哈维
No, everybody thinks they can act, Harvey.

929
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,160
但事实是  你只是长得好看
The fact of the matter is, well, you're just a pretty face.

930
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,120
你觉得我好看
You think I'm pretty?

931
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,030
是非常傻
Pretty stupid.

932
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,510
真不敢相信它真上去了
I can't believe it's actually up there.

933
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,850
这律所改名比普林斯[著名歌手]都频繁
This firm is changing names more than Prince.

934
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,100
谁
Who?

935
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,170
你开玩笑的  对吧
You're kidding, right?

936
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,390
《紫色雨》
Purple Rain.

937
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,820
《树莓贝雷》
Raspberry Beret.

938
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,910
我开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

939
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,200
我本来差点就要重新评估我们的关系了
I almost had to reevaluate our entire relationship.

940
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,050
在你要去为我打倒路易之后吗
After you were gonna go and beat Louis up for me?

941
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,690
我很怀疑
I doubt that.

942
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,380
迈克  谢谢你
Mike, thank you.

943
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,540
那只是应该的
It just seemed right.

944
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,760
毕竟你也为我正面面对路易了
After all, you stood up to Louis for me.

945
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,730
我差点被打
And I almost got pummeled for it.

946
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,680
那需要勇气
That took guts.

947
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,050
所以我爱你
And that's why I love you.

948
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,250
我也爱你
I love you too.

949
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,360
我想告诉你  你说的对
I wanted to tell you that you were right.

950
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,790
是我雇了迈克  引发了这一切
I started this whole thing by hiring Mike.

951
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,120
是我的错
It's my fault.

952
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,530
谢谢你
Thank you.

953
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,550
但我知道这件事情很久了
But I've been on board long enough,

954
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,450
也该接受现实了
and it's time I accepted the fact

955
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,820
那也是我的秘密
that it's my secret too.

956
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,480
那我们接下来怎么办
So where do we go from here?

957
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,670
我们拼尽全力保住秘密
We fight like hell to protect it.

958
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,030
没有蛋糕吗
No cake?

959
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,990
你来做什么  杰西卡
What are you doing here, Jessica?

960
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,290
我知道你等解释已经等烦了
I know you're tired of waiting for an explanation,

961
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,180
所以来给你一个解释
so I'm here to give you one.

962
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,430
你给我过解释了
You've given me explanations before.

963
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,130
我要事实
I want the truth.

964
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,970
你准备好接受事实了吗
Are you ready for the truth?

965
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,430
因为事实可不好看
Because it's not pretty.

966
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,180
只有一个办法来确定
There's only one way to find out.

967
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,170
感觉是很久远的事了
It seems like forever ago,

968
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,640
但其实并没有太久
but it wasn't that long ago at all.

969
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:21,160
丹尼尔·哈德曼挪用律所资金
Daniel Hardman embezzled money from the firm,

970
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,120
我为他遮掩了
and I covered it up.

971
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,750
别想错
Now, make no mistake,

972
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,690
我找出了事实  对抗他
I found about it, I confronted him,

973
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,440
最终让他作出了偿还
and I eventually made him pay it all back.

974
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,810
但我确实遮掩了那事
But I did cover it up.

975
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,910
瞒着合伙人  警方  瞒着所有人
From the partners, from the police, from everyone.

976
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,150
我甚至修改了账目  隐藏了罪行
I even adjusted our books to hide the crime.

977
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:47,330
但路易对这些事像猎犬一样   他发现了
And being a bloodhound about these things, louis found out

978
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,060
利用它作筹码重新回来了
and used it as leverage to come back.

979
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,690
作为冠名合伙人
As name partner.

980
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,590
作为冠名合伙人
As name partner.

981
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,870
你之前为什么不能信任我  告诉我
Why couldn't you trust me with that before?

982
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,750
因为我不知道你会有什么反应
Because I didn't know how you'd react,

983
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:12,320
我不想冒失去...一切的风险
and I didn't want to risk losing everything I had.

984
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,120
杰西卡
Jessica,

985
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,470
我会帮你保密
your secret is safe with me.

986
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,730
你迟到了
You're late.

987
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,320
但我带了礼物来
But I come bearing gifts.

988
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,520
看着不像煎饼卷呀
That doesn't look like cannoli.

989
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,870
这比煎饼卷强多了  爸爸
It's better than cannoli, Dad.

990
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,490
这是你新初级律师的简历
It's the resume of your new associate.

991
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,550
如果这是哈维试图因我没雇路易
If this is Harvey's way of trying to make up for the fact 

992
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,120
而要的补偿...
that I didn't hire Louis--

993
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,310
不是哈维给的  是我
This isn't from Harvey. It's from me.

994
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,030
你要为我做这个
And you're going to do this for me,

995
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,450
我也不会欠你情
and I am not going to owe you a thing.

996
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,380
哥大就是这么教你的吗
This is what they're teaching you at Columbia?

997
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,600
互相帮助这种事不是这么办的
Because that's not how favors work.

998
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,820
我知道该怎么办
I know how favors work.

999
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,200
你做了这事  某天会需要我做别的事
You do this, and then you want something from me someday.

1000
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,450
但到时候你就会知道
But by then you're going to understand that right now 

1001
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,140
现在是我在帮你忙
I'm the one doing you a favor,

1002
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,590
因为卡特里娜·班尼特是个超棒的律师
because Katrina Bennett is an amazing lawyer.

1003
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,140
我之前对你的评价错了
I was wrong about you.

1004
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,540
你不像你妈妈
You're not like your mother.

1005
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,810
你像爸爸
You're like your father.

1006
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,540
拜托
Come on.

1007
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,720
-那很好  -那样很好
- Oh, that's good. - That was a good one.

1008
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,910
是啊  很好
That was a good one.

1009
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,570
说话跟我一样  好女儿
Sounds just like me, baby girl.

1010
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,520
我骗到你了  对吗
I had you fooled, huh?

1011
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,990
没错
You did.

1012
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,550
我来给你演示一下律师怎么做饭吧
Now let me show you how a lawyer cooks.

1013
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,760
你想要什么
What do you want?

1014
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,790
我只是觉得你会需要这个
I just thought you'd want this.

1015
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,710
合伙人给你留的
The associates saved it for you.

1016
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,480
他们没留
No, they didn't.

1017
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,230
是你给我留的
You saved it for me 

1018
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,150
因为你想重新假装是我的朋友
because you want to pretend to be my friend again.

1019
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,010
路易  你没有听到杰西卡的发言吗
Louis, didn't you hear Jessica's speech?

1020
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,860
这是我们把往事一笔勾销的机会
This is our chance wipe the slate clean.

1021
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,170
我听了
I did hear her speech,

1022
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,490
我还知道是她派你来跟我说这些的
and I know that she sent you here to say that to me.

1023
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,650
没人派我来
No one sent me here.

1024
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,360
我来是因为自己想来
I'm here because I want to be here.

1025
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,630
你看  话很好听
You see, that's sweet.

1026
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,940
但我怎么能相信你呢
But how can I ever believe a word you say?

1027
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,650
我想知道你有没有考虑过
I want to know if you ever thought once

1028
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,420
告诉我迈克的真相
to tell me the truth about Mike.

1029
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,440
没有
No, I didn't.

1030
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,410
你当然没有
Of course you didn't.

1031
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,450
-因为我们不是朋友  -你错了
- Because we're not friends. - You're wrong.

1032
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,400
我们是朋友
We are friends,

1033
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,300
但我对哈维的职业忠诚要高于友谊
but my professional loyalty to Harvey comes above that,

1034
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,340
所以我没告诉过任何人
which is why I never told anyone--

1035
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,490
杰西卡  瑞秋  任何人
Jessica, Rachel, anyone.

1036
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,470
站在我的位置  问问你自己
So put yourself in my position and ask yourself,

1037
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,570
你会怎么做
what you would have done?

1038
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,440
我希望你告诉我点别的事
I want you to tell me something else.

1039
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,190
好  什么事都行
Yes. Anything.

1040
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,480
你跟哈维上过床吗
You ever sleep with Harvey?

1041
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,520
等等  什么
Wait. What?

1042
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,320
这不是职业问题
It's not a professional question.

1043
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,640
是私人问题
It's a personal question.

1044
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,760
你能给我们所谓的友谊足够高的地位
