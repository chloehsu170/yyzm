苏西  莎拉
Susie, Sarah,

156
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,510
史黛西  辛克莱
Stacy, Sinclair,

157
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,710
还有莎柏琳娜
And Sabrina.

158
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,410
苏西  怎么这么没礼貌
Susie, where are your manners?

159
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,350
快跟这位小伙子握个手
Shake hands with this nice young man.

160
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,310
我说笑呢  我知道这些都是洋娃娃
Just kidding, I know they're dolls.

161
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,530
她们是以我女儿们的名字命名的
They're named after my daughters.

162
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,760
我就是为了她们开的这家公司
I started the company because of them, really.

163
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,460
你要知道  以前的洋娃娃
You know, dolls didn't used to be

164
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,640
可不像现在那些中国制造的劣质塑料玩具
these cheap, plastic bimbos from China that we have today.

165
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,150
而是妈妈一针一线亲手为孩子缝制的
Your mother made them for you by hand.

166
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,240
我也想让我的女儿们玩我亲手缝制的娃娃
I wanted my girls to have that same experience.

167
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,630
可是现在呢  30年之后
And here we are, 30 years later.

168
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,750
这成了每个家长的噩梦
Every parent's worst nightmare.

169
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,830
什么意思
What do you mean?

170
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,530
这些小天使们  每个可以卖到90元
These little angels, they sell for $90 a pop.

171
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,620
我雇管家的钱就是这么赚来的
I wasn't born with a butler, you know.

172
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,160
我不得不说  你很厉害
I gotta say, this is amazing,

173
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,390
竟会愿意把品牌授权给别人
taking on a project like a licensing deal.

174
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,830
有什么厉害的
Why is that amazing?

175
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,940
我奶奶可做不到
Well, my grandmother could never pull this off.

176
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,330
她已经退休十年了
She's been retired for ten years.

177
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,670
那她现在过得怎么样
How is that treating her?

178
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,870
她住得离我家很近
She lives near my apartment.

179
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,430
我每周都去看她一次
I get to see her once a week, so...

180
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,700
-你很孝顺  -不
- That's very sweet of you. - No.

181
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,500
这不是孝顺
No, it's not.

182
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,410
以前  每当我需要她
You know, whenever I needed her,

183
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,500
她都会在一旁支持我
she was there.

184
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,010
无论发生什么
You know, no matter what.

185
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,150
她都会给我个拥抱
She'd give me a hug,

186
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,680
告诉我一切都会没事的
She'd tell me everything is gonna be all right.

187
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,520
即使情况很糟
Even if it wasn't.

188
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,030
现在是她需要我的时候了  
And now that she needs me,

189
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,360
但我总是在工作
I am always at work.

190
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,460
我...
And I'm--

191
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,590
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

192
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,740
什么事
Yeah?

193
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,620
永远别在客户面前接电话
Never answer your phone in front of a client.

194
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,920
但是你的电话啊  
But it's you.

195
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,830
进展如何
What's happening?

196
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,140
我们正喝茶谈心呢
Well, actually we're in the middle of a tea party.

197
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,540
我就是知道你爱玩洋娃娃
I knew you were the doll-playing type.

198
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,040
让乔伊听电话
Put joy on.

199
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,810
迈克菲女士
Ms. Mcafee.

200
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,810
哈维找您
It's harvey.

201
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,910
乔伊  我很抱歉
Joy, I'm sorry,

202
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,680
咱们得重约了
I have to reschedule.

203
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,080
不用道歉
No need to apologize.

204
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,910
我喜欢眼前这位
I like this one.

205
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,460
喝完茶我就让他回去
I'll send him back after tea.

206
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,500
你不会当着客户的面讨打包盒吧
Tell me you didn't ask our client for a doggy bag.

207
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,110
不能怪我  史黛西坚持要我带给你的
What can I say? Stacy insisted.

208
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,280
刚从乔伊・迈克菲的律师顾问那里回来
Just got off with Joy Mcafee's general counsel.

209
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,370
看样子她已经看透红尘了
It seems she had an epiphany.

210
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,110
她的开价不仅没有提高  反而降低了
She wants less on her plate, not more.

211
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,650
我还以为你能搞定她
I thought you were going to close her.

212
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,580
这个案子我们一定要拿下来
We need that doll money.

213
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,130
我现在就想办法
I'm on top of it.

214
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,910
哈维花了五个月的时间  草拟了这个合约
Harvey took five months to structure that deal.

215
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,000
别把我逼急了
Please don't make me set fire to your desk.

216
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,590
就让你和洋娃娃喝杯茶都做不好
All you had to do was have tea with the dolls.

217
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,830
唐娜  再安排一次和乔伊的茶会  
Donna, schedule another tea party with Joy

218
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,830
越快越好
as soon as possible.

219
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,540
然后把她女儿的名字都发给我
And text me the names of her girls.

220
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,650
真的假的啊
Oh, what a shock.

221
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,210
你居然连女孩的名字都记不住
You can't keep girls' names straight in your head.

222
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,530
就记不住你的  黛比
Just yours, Debbie.

223
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,310
看  很搞笑吧  因为你其实叫唐娜
See, that's funny because your name is Donna.

224
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,720
哈维・斯佩克特
Harvey Specter.

225
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,950
这是你点的东西
I got your order right here.

226
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,210
我没点披萨啊
I didn't order a pizza.

227
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,280
请查收
You've been served.

228
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,070
那个撞了雷的司机
Cab driver who hit Ray

229
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,620
提起了民事诉讼  把我列为目击证人
named me as a witness in a civil suit.

230
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,120
我得去拜访下特雷斯・比克
I need to pay Travis Bickle a visit.

231
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,120
电影《出租车司机》男主角

232
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,580
哈维  如果你能让我和乔伊谈谈
Harvey, if you let me go talk to Joy,

233
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,660
-我肯定能挽回局面  -不必了
- I know I can fix this-- -No.

234
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,600
没人会让一只狗狗清理自己的便便
You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess.

235
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,200
幸运的是  你没有狗狗需要你担心
Optimally, you don't even have a puppy.

236
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,480
罗斯  据说你和客户聊了下天
Ross, rumor has it you talked a client

237
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,710
就损失了两百万
out of $200 million.

238
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,980
价格还没最终敲定
The deal's not off the table, all right?

239
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,380
只是碰了个钉子
It's just a speed bump.

240
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,080
哥们  我想他又有新绰号了
Dude, I think we just found him a new nickname.

241
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,260
小钉子
Speed bump!

242
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,170
感觉又回到了高中
I feel like I'm back in high school.

243
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,290
你高中的绰号叫小钉子吗
They called you speed bump in high school?

244
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,650
开玩笑啦
Kidding.

245
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,260
但如果你需要个盒子来收拾东西走人的话
But if you need any boxes to pack up your office, just--

246
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,790
等等
Wait a minute, uh--

247
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,140
给
There.

248
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,100
这是你的吧
I think that belongs to you.

249
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,680
如果你皮够厚的话  这些都不算什么
It wouldn't hurt so much if you had thicker skin.

250
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,560
特雷弗来电

251
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,910
什么事
What do you want?

252
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,110
我想还你的保释金
I wanna pay you back for posting bail.

253
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,450
特雷弗  你五年级欠我的40块还没还
Trevor, you've owed me 40 bucks since fifth grade.

254
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,960
一笔勾销了  明白吗
I wrote it off, okay?

255
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,820
听着  我只想洗清案底
Look, I want a clean slate, okay?

256
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,590
如果你不想见我  我会把支票寄给你
So you don't want to see me, I'll mail you a check.

257
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,370
好
Okay.

258
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,990
那明晚见面吧
Yeah, let's hang out tomorrow night.

259
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,360
别玩得太疯  行吗
Nothing crazy, though, all right?

260
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,360
我早上还得早起
I have to be up early.

261
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,530
要想安分一点的话
We can crochet panty hose

262
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,000
我们可以一起织连裤袜
if that's what it takes to be cool.

263
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,440
那也太安分了吧
I think we can do a little better than that.

264
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,810
不如我们...
Why don't we, uh...

265
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,270
7:30在雷克斯酒吧碰头怎么样
Why don't we say Rex's, 7:30.

266
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,840
前六轮我请
First six rounds are on me.

267
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,410
要是你真的想报答我
If you're serious about paying me back,

268
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,240
前一百轮都得你请
the first 100 rounds are on you.

269
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,500
来了个难缠的家伙
So it's the tough guy.

270
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,440
这个问题保险公司就能解决
This is a matter for insurance,

271
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,900
根本不用打官司
not a frivolous lawsuit.

272
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,210
我告诉你
You know, for your information,

273
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,470
我可是遭受了情感创伤
I suffered emotional pain.

274
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,640
情感创伤吗
Emotional pain?

275
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,370
把这些涂在你的伤口上吧
Rub this on your emotional pain.

276
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,210
你这个居高临下的混蛋
You condescending son of a--

277
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,470
看着我  我只提醒你这一次
Look at me, I am gonna warn you once.

278
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,880
别再纠缠了
Do not pursue this matter.

279
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,600
要知道我曾三次从枪口下死里逃生
You know, I have been held up at gunpoint three times.

280
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,260
你认为凭一套名贵的西装
So do you think a fancy suit

281
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,630
和五百元的做发型就能吓唬住我吗
and a $500 haircut, that's gonna scare me?

282
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,400
你要是把我的司机告上法庭
You take my driver to court,

283
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,700
我会亲自为他辩护
I'm gonna represent him myself.

284
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,500
你输了之后
And when you lose,

285
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,730
还要支付我的代理费
you'll be covering my fee,

286
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,300
那可比理个发贵多了
which is gonna be a hell of a lot of haircuts.

287
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,270
原来他不是你临时雇的
Hmm, so you weren't a one-way fare.

288
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,710
雷为我工作了八年
Ray's worked for me eight years.

289
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,610
那你就当不成目击证人了
Then you don't have to worry about being a witness,

290
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,810
因为作为雇主
because as his employer,

291
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,410
你要为他的行为负责
you're liable for his actions.

292
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,310
知道吗  我觉得你是《甜心俏佳人》看多了
You know, I think you've seen way too many reruns of Ally Mcbeal.

293
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,310
美国曾经的热门法律肥皂喜剧

294
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,650
911之后不久  我来到美国
You know, I emigrated here after September 11th,

295
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,620
政府却不允许任何人移民
and they shut the doors on everybody.

296
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,890
我请不起律师  只好亲自将他们告上法庭
I couldn't pay for a lawyer, so I had to take them to court.

297
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,530
我为我的公民权而起诉
I sued for my citizenship,

298
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,930
因此我对法律有着特别的感激之情
so I have a very special appreciation for the law.

299
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,600
我对纯麦威士忌也有感情
I appreciate a good single malt.

300
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,340
但我不会假装自己会酿酒
I don't pretend I can make one.

301
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,880
我让美国政府输得一败涂地  律师
I wiped the floor with the U.S. Government, counselor.

302
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,310
你会受到相同的待遇
I'm gonna do the same with you.

303
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,060
-雷  -唐娜
- Ray.  - Donna.

304
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,270
你来这里做什么  你没找我预约
What are you doin' here? I don't have you scheduled.

305
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,100
我要见哈维
Uh, I need to see Harvey.

306
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,310
你知道规矩的
Oh, come on. You know the rules.

307
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,040
没有搜查证  教皇敕令或是我的许可
No one sets foot in there without a warrant,

308
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,610
谁也别想进去
a papal edict, or my say-so.

309
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,980
我受到了赔偿百万美金的起诉
I just got named in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.

310
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,410
那场事故不是我的错
The accident wasn't my fault.

311
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,680
我可以去见哈维吗
Can I get in to see Harvey, please?

312
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,650
什么也别说了  我会让你进去的
Okay, say no more. I will get you in.

313
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,750
你有御姐范儿的时候真美
You are so beautiful when you're forceful.

314
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,650
我知道你是在赞美我
I know you meant that as a compliment,

315
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,660
但是我不希望别人夸我美的时候
but I don't appreciate limitations being placed

316
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,060
还加限定词
on my beauty.

317
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,430
哈维  修车就已经花了我很多钱了
Harvey, I'm already losing money with my car in the shop.

318
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,130
参加审讯意味着我还没法工作
A trial means I can't work.

319
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,950
你觉得我的名字
And how do you think my name

320
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,790
会给纽约陪审团留下什么印象
is gonna play in front of a New York jury?

321
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,990
拉希姆・班加西
Rahim Benghazi.

322
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,900
我看来是要买张去关塔那摩的单程票了
I may as well buy a one-way ticket to Guantanamo.

323
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,900
关塔那摩监狱:美军的拘留营  其中的囚犯被怀疑与基地组织有关联

324
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,000
绝对不会
Not gonna happen.

325
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,970
要是我输了
If I lose,

326
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,070
我连办车辆许可证的钱都付不起
I won't even be able to afford a livery license,

327
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,510
更不用谈保险了
let alone my insurance.

328
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,570
所以我要为我们两个辩护
That's why I'm gonna be defending both of us.

329
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,380
雷  这个诉讼处处针对我
Ray, this goes against every fiber of my being.

330
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,880
我来代理你的案子  分文不取
I'm taking your case pro bono.

331
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,410
我不知道要说什么
I don't know what to say.

332
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,150
什么都别说  我得维护我的名誉
Absolutely nothing, I've got a reputation to maintain.

333
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,650
再说  这很快就结束了
Besides, it's not gonna take long, okay?

334
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,690
我不会让法庭受理的
I'm gonna get it dismissed.

335
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,580
唐娜  打给法庭
Donna, call the court.

336
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,960
让他们把这个案子提到前面审理
We need priority status on the docket.

337
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,130
我已经试过了
Yeah, I already tried.

338
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,060
你碰到的是巴勒莫法官
You drew judge Palermo.

339
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,170
你知道你该做什么吧
You know what you have to do, don't you?

340
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,700
知道  又是一个处处针对我的人
Yeah. The other thing that goes against every fiber of my being.

341
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,740
路易  有没有人称赞你是个优雅的男高音
Louis, has anyone told you you're an exquisite soprano?

342
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,910
你想要什么  哈维
What do you want, Harvey?

343
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,710
问得好  让我说违心话太痛苦了
You're right. Why prolong my suffering?

344
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,780
我要你帮我安排和巴勒莫法官见面
I need you to get me in to see judge Palermo.

345
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,650
你要我帮忙  不打算给我点好处吗
You need my help, and you're not gonna pull rank on me?

346
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,390
你这案件和事务所没任何关系  对吧
Your case has nothing to do with firm business, does it?

347
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,620
你要什么
What's it gonna take?

348
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,330
脚部护理还是塞琳时装发布会的票
A mani-pedi? Tickets to Celine?

349
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,530
我帮你去问问
I'll see what I can do.

350
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,630
那你的无理要求是
And your pound of flesh?

351
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,290
我需要人挠背的时候会叫你的
I need my back scratched, I'll let you know.

352
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,970
路易  除非那是什么隐喻  否则免谈
Louis, unless that's a metaphor, the deal's off.

353
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,440
乔伊  我那天告诉你我奶奶活不长了的时候
Joy, when I told you that my grandmother didn't have much time,

354
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,410
我不知道她其实只比你大15岁
I--I didn't realize that she's 15 years older than you.

355
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,350
你怎么知道我多大了
Now, how would you know how old I am?

356
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,480
那可是高度机密啊
That is a very closely guarded secret.

357
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,320
我做了些调查
I did some research.

358
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,650
很机灵嘛
Very resourceful.

359
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,160
我只是为了确定
I did it to assure myself

360
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,890
你能否承受更大的工作量
that you can handle a heavier workload.

361
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,760
多谢关心  但是我不是担心自己的健康
I appreciate that, but I'm not worried about my health.

362
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,900
是因为钱吗
Is it the money?

363
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,210
我可以保证  签约之后  预付的这两亿
Because I can guarantee, 200 million up front

364
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,710
只不过是你将赚到的十分之一
is just 1/10 of what you stand to make on this deal.

365
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,630
迈克
Michael,

366
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,240
我的洋娃娃比大部分人吃得都好
My dolls eat better than most people.

367
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,840
我不缺钱
I've got plenty of money.

368
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,940
而签下这合约  我就要再干五年
This deal meant staying on for five more years

369
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,440
而且工作量要翻一番
and doubling my workload.

370
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,220
我准备带孙子孙女们坐游轮
I am going to take my grandchildren on a cruise

371
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,490
-去塔希提岛玩  -塔希提岛
- to Tahiti.  - Tahiti?

372
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,760
这个授权合约里
You know, the licensing agreement

373
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,890
还包含了一个主题公园
includes a theme park.

374
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,330
你可以带他们去那儿玩啊
You could-- you could take them there.

375
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,960
这跟合约无关
It's not about the deal.

376
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,230
我守着窗外同样的景色过了25年
I have had this same view for 25 years.

377
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,600
我要换个地方
I need a change of scenery.

378
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,370
我会去找哈维  然后跟他说
I am gonna speak to Harvey, and I'm gonna tell him

379
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,940
我要把整个公司都卖掉
that I want to sell the whole business.

380
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,870
那个...
So...

381
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,480
我刚跟巴勒莫法官说好
I just spoke to Judge Palermo.

382
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,140
因为他觉得我是个好人
And because he thinks I'm a good guy,

383
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,150
我还说算我欠他个人情
and I told him I'd owe him one,

384
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,980
所以你的案子被一路向前挪了
your case is gonna be moved up way ahead.

385
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,150
给我挠背吧
Back scratch.

386
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,420
我是家里的独子  不用干那种事
I don't have a firstborn, you know,

387
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,720
你到底想要我怎么报答你
so what exactly do you want for that?

388
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,190
不行  我哪条领带都不能给你
No, you're not getting one of my ties.

389
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,230
不对
No.

390
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,530
你的肩膀怎么了  什么
Your shoulder? What--

391
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,330
你的翻领吗
Your lapel--

392
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,330
你要唐娜吗
Donna?

393
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:23,940
天啊
Oh, god.

394
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,170
诺玛要去伊斯但布尔待两周
Norma is going to Istanbul for two weeks,

395
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,210
你也知道我跟临时助理处不好
and you know that I'm not good with temps.

396
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,970
我的天啊  你要点别的吧
Oh, my god. Ask me for something else.

397
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,440
哈维  这没的商量
Harvey, this is non-negotiable.

398
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,710
你现在欠我人情呢
You owe me now.

399
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,750
我可不能把唐娜给你
Donna is one thing that I can't give you.

400
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,350
-为什么不能  -首先
- Why not? - For one thing,

401
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,520
她肯定不会同意的
she'd never agree to it.

402
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,580
你是她的老板
You're her boss.

403
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,720
你给她下命令就是了
You just tell her to do stuff.

404
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,920
我从不给她下命令
I don't tell her to do anything.

405
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,920
她很自觉的
She just does.

406
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:42,950
好啊  这样的话
All right, fine. You know what?

407
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,920
这...  没关系
That's just... Not a problem.

408
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,850
我就给巴勒莫法官打个电话
I will call Judge Palermo,

409
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,060
跟他说我搞错了
and I'll tell him i was mistaken,

410
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,130
你的庭审会被排在
and then your hearing will be in,

411
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,060
大约六个月之后吧
I don't know, maybe six months?

412
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,110
这样吧
I tell you what.

413
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,860
要是你自己能去说服她
If you can convince her yourself,

414
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,900
我就没意见
you have my blessing.

415
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,270
她会爱我爱得欲罢不能
She's gonna love me so much,

416
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,370
你拼了老命才能把她要回来
you're gonna fight to get her back.

417
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,040
你好啊  唐娜
Hi, Donna.

418
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,540
哈维和我刚刚还谈到你呢
Harvey and I were just, uh, talking about you.

419
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,660
不行
No.

420
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,250
你都不知道我要说什么呢
You don't even know what I was gonna say.

421
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,390
我知道
Yes, I do.

422
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,220
怎么可能
And how is that possible?

423
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,920
我读得懂唇语  看得懂肢体语言
I read lips, I know body language,

424
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,300
而且我常跟诺玛聊天
and I talk to Norma.

425
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,500
我不是你游乐园赢来的奖品  路易
I'm not some token you win at a fair, Louis.

426
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,970
我知道你不是  你当然不是奖品
You're not--I know you're not. You're not a token.

427
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,970
我也是个人  而且...
I'm a human being, and I--

428
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,240
是啊  当然
Yes, you are.

429
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,470
对不起  我只是
I'm sorry, I just--

430
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,540
你知道吗  你说的话让我感觉很...
You know what, that just made me feel really...

431
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,310
卑贱
cheap.

432
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,180
我只是想告诉你   
I'm just trying to tell you that

433
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,090
你的工作非常出色  唐娜
you're really good at what you do,  Donna.

434
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,250
所以我想请你...
So I'm gonna ask you--

435
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,590
我现在感觉灵魂都受伤了
It's like my soul hurts now.

436
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,730
不  唐娜  听我说
No, Donna, listen,

437
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,460
就算你的灵魂受了点伤...
even if your soul hurts a little bit--

438
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,820
对不起
I'm sorry.

439
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,930
没事的
It's okay.

440
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,930
不会有事的  别哭啊
It's gonna be fine. Don't cry.

441
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,930
求你别哭啊  唐娜
Please don't cry, Donna.

442
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,500
该死
Oh, shit.

443
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,970
看来我要谢谢你了  演戏太好玩了
I think I owe you one for that. That was fun.

444
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,070
等等  上次你痛哭流涕
Wait a second, the-- the time that you cried,

445
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,480
我就答应让你父母住在我公寓里  那是演的吗
and then I let your parents stay in my condo--

446
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,080
没错
Yup.

447
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,890
你不想说说发生了什么吗
So you don't want to talk about it?

448
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,920
有什么好说的
What is there to talk about?

449
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,030
我做了老板叮嘱我别去做的事
I did exactly what my boss told me not to do,

450
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,590
还把事情都搞砸了
and it blew up in my face.

451
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,210
哥们  我都说我来请客了
Dude, I told you, I'm taking care of this.

452
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,240
在我失业前  就让我最后付一次吧
In my last few hours of employment, please, I should pay.

453
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,910
把钱包收起来
All right, put the wallet away.

454
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,240
皮尔逊・哈德曼律所
迈克・罗斯
律师助理

455
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,510
不赖啊
This is epic.

456
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,410
这东西正适合用来忽悠人
This is the scam we always talked about.

457
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,420
天啊  我敢说你是左右逢"女人缘"呢
God, I bet you're gettin' laid left and right.

458
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,090
对啊  就是这样的
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

459
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,490
过一段时间就没那么好使了
You lose appreciation after a while.

460
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,090
-拿来  -不错
- Come on. - Yeah.

461
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,590
怎么还写上了电话
Why'd you put a phone number on there?

462
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,460
那是家真实存在的公司
It's a real firm.

463
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,630
是吗
Oh, yeah?

464
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,860
你干嘛呢
What are you doing?

465
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,830
打给职员名录处
Oh, I'm just calling the employee directory.

466
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,430
这都是用来忽悠人的
It's part of the scam, man.

467
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,600
-他们会核实你的说法  -别闹了
- They'll check your story. - Stop it.

468
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,600
-怎么  -特雷弗  挂了
- What? - Trevor, stop.

469
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,600
-挂掉电话  -不要
- Hang up the phone. - Oh, no.

470
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,670
特雷弗  挂掉电话
Trevor, hang up the phone, stop!

471
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,240
-怎么了  -好吧  我在那里上班
- What? - All right? I'm working there.

472
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,970
是吗  当上律师了吗
Oh, yeah. What, as a lawyer?

473
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,910
你真的...
Are you--

474
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,940
哥们
Dude.

475
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,110
说来话长  行了吧
It's a long story, okay?

476
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,610
你不能跟任何人说  永远不能  好吗
But you can't tell anyone. Ever. Okay?

477
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,720
太赞了
That is awesome!

478
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,650
我一直都说
Man, I-- I always said

479
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,650
你要是戒了大麻
that if you quit smoking pot,

480
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,820
就能当上律师
you could do it.

481
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,690
是啊 
Yeah.

482
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,770
没错  你是说了
Yeah, oh, that's right. Yeah, you did.

483
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,360
就在你把大麻递给我之前
Right before you passed me the bowl.

484
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,910
怎么了
What?

485
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,740
没什么  我就是...
Naw, I just--

486
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,900
希望你能放心地告诉我
I wish you trusted me enough to tell me.

487
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,570
我不就是害你陷进了缉毒突击检查吗
I mean, all I did was set you up on a drug bust.

488
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,040
天呐  现在还不能开这个玩笑是吧
Oh, god, that was too soon.

489
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,670
对不起
I'm sorry.

490
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,730
女士们  你们好啊
Hi, ladies. How are you?

491
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,780
我跟你们说  如果你们任何一个人
Um, I want to let you know, if you--either of you

492
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,710
因为任何事被逮捕了
ever get arrested for anything,

493
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,000
可以给这家伙打电话  他是本市最好的律师
you call this guy. He's the best attorney in the city.

494
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,590
我们为什么会被逮捕呢
Well, what would we get arrested for?

495
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,590
这个嘛  我不知道
Um... I don't know.

496
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,220
你们打算干点什么呢
What are you thinking about doing?

497
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:10,080
作为你的律师  我绝对要建议你那么干
I-- As your attorney, I would definitely advise you to do that.

498
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,910
-再来四杯  -好的
- Uh, four more. - Yeah.

499
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,940
我必须提醒你  为你自己辩护可不是...
I must warn you that representing yourself at trial is not the--

500
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,750
他怎么在这里
What's he doing here?

501
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,940
你以为你约了和法官见面  我会不知道吗
You think you can schedule a meeting without me knowing it?

502
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,450
不  不
Oh, no.

503
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,160
我有权参与你和法院之间所有的交流
I'm privy to all communication between you and the court.

504
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,960
如果你开车的经验和法律知识一样丰富
Well, if your driving matched your legal knowledge,

505
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,990
我们就不用过来了
we wouldn't be here.

506
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,030
法官大人你好
Your honor.

507
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,400
这个案子不应被受理  这是保险的范畴
This case should be dismissed. It's a matter for insurance.

508
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,950
保险只包括修理费用
Insurance only covers repairs.

509
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,490
却不能弥补我的损失
It does not deal with my losses.

510
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,660
什么损失
What losses?

511
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,840
就因为这场事故  
Because of the accident,

512
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,970
我错失了得到出租车执照的机会
I missed my chance to get my taxi medallion.

513
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,860
你就不能明年再买吗
You can't just buy it next year?

514
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,010
我的贷款一周内就要到期了
The loan I got expires in one week.

515
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,110
而且  这次的执照只要三十万
On top of that, a medallion costs 300,000 this go-round.

516
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,020
明年就要三十五万了
Next year, 350.

517
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,500
所以他的所有要求都建立在
So his entire claim rests upon

518
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,750
假设他能获得今年的执照的基础之上
the assumption that he would've won this year's medallion.

519
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,020
美国的特点就是
The hallmark of America

520
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,520
小人物也能得到正义
is that the little guy gets to see justice done.

521
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,550
法律面前人人平等
We are all equals in the eyes of the law.

522
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,330
所以在世界上这么多国家里
That is why, out of all the countries in the world,

523
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,560
我选择来到这里
I chose to come here.

524
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,360
你想怎么回应这个观点呢  律师
What do you got to say about that, counselor?

525
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,700
我得说这位大律师的发言很精彩
I say Atticus Finch makes a good speech here.

526
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,700
安迪克斯・芬奇:小说人物  律师

527
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,830
但这只是一场小事故
But this is a fender-bender,

528
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,910
根本用不着打官司
Not a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.

529
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,440
替代责任适用于
Vicarious liability applies to

530
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,860
歧视  骚扰和意外事故
discrimination, harassment, and accidents.

531
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,020
雇主对雇员的过失负有责任
Employers are responsible for their employees' negligence.

532
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,170
法院觉得这是个合理的诉讼
Court finds a reasonable suit here.

533
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,490
审判明天开始
Trial starts tomorrow.

534
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,640
谢谢你  法官大人
Thank you, your honor.

535
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,340
看我们斗嘴很开心是吧
You're getting a good kick out of this, aren't you?

536
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,310
确实
I am.

537
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,190
但我不是因为这点才接的这案子
But I'm taking this on its merits.

538
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,240
你明天最好拿出你的最高水平
And you better bring your "A" game tomorrow,

539
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,990
因为他提出的是合法要求
'cause he's got a legitimate claim.

540
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,680
他不是想打官司吗  
He wants a trial?

541
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,390
看我怎么把他打得落花流水
I'll give him a goddamn trial.

542
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,820
法官大人
Your honor.

543
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,940
你赢过多少个案子了
So how many cases have you won?

544
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,660
我只记得我输了多少场
I only remember how many I've lost.

545
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,470
没输过
None.

546
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,840
等等  怎么还不上酒
Wait, what happened to the drinks?

547
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,050
我有个好主意
I got a better idea.

548
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,330
我们拿一整瓶
Let's say we get a bottle

549
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,680
回你家继续喝如何
and take the party back to your place?

550
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,460
必须得是法国廊酒
Make it a bottle of dom, and you're on.

551
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,240
没问题  四瓶怎么样
All right, how about four bottles?

552
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,770
来吧
Come on.

553
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,280
我们要不要叫个出租车
You guys want to get a cab?

554
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,320
绝对要
Definitely.

555
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,780
绝对要  出租车  四瓶廊酒
Definitely. Cab, four bottles of dom.

556
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,100
你还想再多花点我的钱吗
You want to spend any more of my money?

557
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,180
淡定点  行吗
Just relax, okay?

558
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,380
这叫午夜场消费
It's an investment in the evening.

559
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,920
而且  我之所以说要回家喝
And, uh, I just said the thing about the bottles

560
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,300
就是为了把姑娘们带出酒吧
to get the girls out of the bar.

561
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,640
真的吗  我怎么觉得
Really? 'cause it looked like

562
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,180
你是想躲开那些家伙
you were trying to get away from those guys.

563
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,380
出租车
Taxi!

564
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,130
-什么家伙  -后面那些家伙
- What guys? - The guys in the back.

565
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,880
你知道我指的是谁  快说  那些人是谁
You know what I'm talking about. Come on, who are they?

566
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,690
什么  那两个吗  我不知道
What? Those two? I--I--I don't know.

567
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,110
出租车都去哪了
Where are all the...cabs?

568
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,770
看样子他们可认识你
Well, it looked like they knew you,

569
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,330
而且不是因为什么好事
and not in a very good way.

570
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,970
我不知道  也许他们刚才
I--I don't know. Maybe they were, uh,

571
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,470
跟我们的姑娘调情来着  好吧
flirting with our dates, okay?

572
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,840
要是我看到那两个美腿姑娘离我而去
I'd be pissed too if I watched those legs

573
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,990
我也会很生气的
walk away from me.

574
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,920
感觉怎样  姑娘们
How are we doin', ladies?

575
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,410
穿这双高跟鞋  我的脚要疼死了
My feet are killing me in these heels.

576
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,990
-不好意思   -特雷弗  别闹了
- I'm sorry. - Hey, Trevor, come on--

577
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,600
出租车
Taxi!

578
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,510
说真的  别跟我闹了  刚才到底怎么回事
Seriously, stop playing with me. What was that about back there?

579
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,940
我没跟你闹  好吧
Look, I'm not playing with you, all right?

580
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,490
如果你用对套路
But just play your cards right,

581
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,000
也许你跟...也许玛榭会...
maybe you and, uh, maybe Marcella will, uh,

582
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,560
-也许她会跟你玩玩  -好吧
- maybe she'll play with you. - Okay.

583
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,350
会很挤的
Now, it's gonna be a tight squeeze.

584
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,600
谁想坐我腿上
Who wants to sit on my lap?

585
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,050
要跟着他吗
Want to go after him?

586
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,670
不用  我们可以通过这个找到他
No, we're gonna get to him through this guy.

587
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,270
就像当年一样是吧
Ah-ha! Just like the good old days, huh?

588
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,220
你搞笑吗
Are you kidding me?

589
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,000
这可比当年好多了
This is way better than the good old days.

590
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,290
我居然丢了一只鞋
I--I'm actually missing a shoe.

591
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,370
我们这是在哪里
Hey, where are we?

592
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,730
我觉得这是霍博肯酒店
Uh, I think we're in Hoboken.

593
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,120
你找我有事吗
You wanted to see me?

594
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,710
我让你别去见乔伊  你没听我的话吧
Did you go see Joy after I told you not to?

595
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,050
你怎么知道的
How did you know?

596
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,390
我本来不知道  你刚告诉我的
I didn't. Until now.

597
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,440
我跟你说过了
I told you,

598
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,000
小狗狗没法清理自己的便便
a puppy can't clean up its own mess.

599
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,390
什么便便  我只不过给她讲了我奶奶的事
Mess? All I did was tell her about my grandmother.

600
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,160
你的任务是要给我减轻负担
Your job is to make my life easier.

601
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,760
如果这你都不明白  那我雇你干什么
If you can't understand that, why did I hire you?

602
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,570
这是报案记录的总结
Police report summarized.

603
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,680
交通信号分析
Traffic signal analysis.

604
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,600
出租车牌照的报价  出席者和竞拍结果
Medallion bids, attendees, and results.

605
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,910
你雇我就是干这些的
That's why you hired me.

606
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,640
我还以为你一心扑在乔伊的案子上了
I thought you were all over the Joy situation.

607
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,630
结果整个第六版都是关于你的报道
Instead, you're all over page six.

608
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,630
你不是想让我做无偿法律服务吗  这就是
You wanted me to do pro bono work, this is it.

609
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,970
无偿法律服务是为了提升律所的形象
Pro bono enhances a firm's image.

610
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,070
而这却让我们看起来像地主恶霸
This makes us look like wealthy bullies

611
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,820
欺负一个普通的出租车司机
against an everyman cabbie.

612
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,630
你觉得这有助于提高我们律所的形象吗
Does that seem like it enhances our image to you?

613
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,670
我拒绝回答这个问题
I refuse to answer that,

614
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,600
因为我不想回答
on the grounds that I don't want to.

615
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,770
有人昨晚玩得很爽啊
Someone had a fun night.

616
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,440
又接了一个不该接的电话吗
Answer another call you shouldn't have?

617
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,590
我没有...  我那是在...
I--I-- I didn't--I was--

618
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,000
给你个提示  领导向下级抛出的问题
Piece of advice-- when the big dog asks the puppy

619
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,380
有时只是反问而已
something like that, it's a rhetorical question.

620
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,500
明白了
Got it.

621
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,910
等等
Before you go,

622
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,350
那天开会时
the phone call, the other day,

623
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,070
你接的那个电话...
when you answered it during the meeting...

624
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,960
抱歉  我以后不会了
Yeah. Sorry about that. Won't happen again.

625
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,400
谁打来的
Who was it?

626
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,750
一个朋友而已  有点急事
Um, it's just a friend. You know, an emergency.

627
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,090
什么样的急事
What kind of emergency?

628
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,570
是不是那个让你走私毒品
Was it a friend who almost got you

629
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,330
害你差点被捕的朋友
busted for drug trafficking?

630
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,090
是他吗  特雷弗
That friend? Trevor?

631
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,000
他洗手不干了  哈维
He's not dealing anymore, harvey.

632
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,130
看来确实是他
So it was him.

633
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,570
他从监狱里打给你的吗
He called you from jail?

634
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,700
要知道  做律师这行
You know, I make a living

635
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,430
要学会读心  迈克
learning how to read people, Mike.

636
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,770
既然我能看穿你  那杰西卡也能
So if I saw it, Jessica did too.

637
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,730
这就是你想给大家留下的印象吗
Is that the kind of impression you want to leave around here?

638
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,580
那家伙不是你朋友
This guy is not your friend.

639
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,810
他只能拖你后腿  甩掉他吧
He is an anchor dragging you down. Get rid of him.

640
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,420
他是我交情最久的朋友  哈维
He is my oldest friend, Harvey.

641
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,090
我不能眼睁睁看着他在监狱里受罪
I wasn't just gonna let him rot in jail.

642
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,450
那下次你想怎么办
What's gonna happen the next time?

643
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,930
因为注定还会有下次
'Cause there will be a next time.

644
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,330
你还会保他出来吗
You gonna bail him out?

645
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,700
置你自己的安危于不顾吗
Put yourself in jeopardy?

646
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,880
要是没有特雷弗
You know, if it weren't for Trevor,

647
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,260
我们永远不可能认识
you and I never would've met.

648
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,930
甩掉他吧
Cut him loose.

649
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,990
我们想见迈克・罗斯
We're here to see Mike Ross.

650
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,800
他是个助理律师
He's an associate.

651
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,600
他的朋友特雷弗推荐我们来的
His friend Trevor referred us.

652
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,390
谢谢你
Thank you.

653
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,220
看样子他们可认识你  而且不是因为什么好事
It looked like they knew you, and not in a very good way.

654
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,670
警官  请问
Excuse me, officer.

655
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,130
中央公园是这么走吗
Is-- is Central Park that way?

656
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,350
对  就是沿着这条街走
Yeah, just go right there.

657
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,640
不好意思
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm--I'm--

658
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,720
我真是个十足的路痴
I'm really terrible with direction.

659
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,100
你是说沿着这条路走吗
Is it this street, right here?

660
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,900
-对  这条路  -这条路
- Yeah, this street, yes. - This street.

661
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,830
就在那里吗
Right here?

662
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,140
-对  -好的
- Yeah. - Okay.

663
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,350
特雷弗  我是迈克  给我回电
Trevor, it's Mike. Call me back.

664
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,190
告诉我到底发生了什么
I need to know what the hell's going on.

665
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,630
那些红天鹅绒纸杯蛋糕你拿了吗
Did you get the red velvet cupcakes?

666
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,780
拿了  三十六个  多加糖衣
Yes, three dozen, extra icing.

667
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,500
那是怎么弄的
How the hell did that happen?

668
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,910
既然这样
Okay. You know what?

669
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,220
好了  问题解决了
There. Problem solved.

670
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,080
我是问你  衣服是怎么弄破了
I asked you, how'd you get that tear?

671
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,780
有几个人去了咱们律所
A couple of guys came to the firm.

672
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,470
想要找我
They were looking for me.

673
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,510
我不知道他们找我干什么  但我...
I don't know what they wanted, but I'm...

674
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,700
我很清楚这和特雷弗做过的事有关
I'm pretty sure it something to do with some shit Trevor did.

675
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,760
你那聪明的小脑瓜
And that big brain of yours

676
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,650
不记得我让你和那个窝囊废断绝关系吗
doesn't remember me saying to cut ties with that loser?

677
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,170
你知道吗
You know what?

678
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,300
整整一周你都在忙你朋友的案子
You've been blowing off Joy's deal

679
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,480
完全顾不上乔伊  你有什么资格说我
all week for your friend, okay? So please.

680
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,170
首先  特雷弗不是你朋友
First of all, Trevor's not your friend.

681
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,370
你想知道我为什么会帮助雷吗
You want to know why I'm loyal to Ray?

682
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,670
那次我把三千美元落在了一辆豪华轿车里
I was taking a limo, and I left $3,000 in it.

683
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,360
司机恰巧就是雷
Ray happened to be the driver.

684
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,180
他捡到钱后  找到我
He found it and tracked me down.

685
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,560
分文不少地还给了我
Not a nickel of it was missing,

686
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,260
车祸发生后  他的第一反应是
And his first reaction when this accident occurred

687
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,680
问我们受没受伤
was to ask if we were okay.

688
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,960
如果换做特雷弗  他会怎样
Now, what would Trevor's have been?

689
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,690
甩掉他吧
Cut him off.

690
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,200
既然说到了授权合约这个案子
Now, as far as the licensing deal goes,

691
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,510
虽然你认为我无暇顾及
just because you think I'm blowing something off

692
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,990
但事实并非如此
doesn't mean I am.

693
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,690
瞧我的  学着点
Now, watch and learn.

694
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,050
你离任的前期工作都安排妥当了
Everything's set for you to walk away.

695
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,620
我们将整体抛售你所持有的股份
We're selling your stake as a block.

696
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,390
目前猎头正在物色你的下任
Your, uh, headhunter's lining up your replacement as we speak.

697
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,170
哈维
Well, Harvey,

698
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,360
这简直太让我惊喜了
this was the most wonderful surprise.

699
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,840
你是我们的长期客户  你又那么想和家人团聚
You're a long-time client who wants to be with her family.

700
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,540
这是我应该做的
It's the least I could do.

701
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,750
你马上就能拥有大把的时光和孩子们
And you'll have all the free time in the world

702
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,200
-共享天伦  -乔伊把微波炉打破了
- to spend with them. - Joey broke the microwave.

703
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,630
太棒了
Oh, that's great.

704
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,320
要多久才能把他们送回家
Now, how soon can we send 'em home?

705
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,120
他们订的是明早最早的航班
They're booked on the first flight out, tomorrow morning.

706
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,990
你让唐娜把孩子们的名字发给你...
So when you had Donna text you the girls' names--

707
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,970
我指的是她亲生女儿们的名字
I was talking about her daughters.

708
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,620
于是你就把她们都接来了
And you were gonna fly them out all along.

709
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,570
你记不记得我说过
Do you remember when I said,

710
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,540
"没人会让小狗狗清理自己的便便"
"You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess?"

711
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,660
我记得  哈维
Yes, Harvey, I do.

712
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,890
我可不是小狗狗
I'm not a puppy.

713
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,080
开庭
Court will come to order.

714
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,630
桑塔纳先生  请做开庭陈述
Mr. Santana, your opening statement, please.

715
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,050
出租车司机是个平凡的职业
Driving a cab is not very glamorous.

716
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,870
但也是份勤恳务实的工作
But it's an honest day's work.

717
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,000
自从入行以来
Ever since I started,

718
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,860
我就希望能够告诉乘客
I looked forward to a time when I could tell customers

719
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,310
他们乘坐的是我的车子
that they were riding in my cab.

720
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,580
我是一个自主营业者
That I was an owner-operator.

721
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,350
所以我精打细算  勤俭节约
So I scrimped, and I saved,

722
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,570
终于攒够钱可以买执照了
until I finally had enough put away to buy a medallion.

723
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,050
但是...
But...

724
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,910
因为这位男士的行为
Because of the actions of this man,

725
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,390
我失去了这个机会
I've lost that opportunity.

726
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,120
毫无疑问
So make no mistake, this--

727
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,980
这场审讯的重点并非破碎的前照灯
This trial is not about a busted headlight.

728
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,530
而是破碎的梦想
This is a trial about a broken dream.

729
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,620
瞧他那架势  和总统竞职演说似的
Forget the case, they're gonna make him president.

730
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,550
开庭陈述就像罚球  简单得很
Statements are like free throws--easy.

731
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,020
因为没人防守
Nobody's playing defense.

732
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,190
我们善于防守吗
Are we good at defense?

733
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,980
你同意私人司机会引发更多的事故吗
You would agree that chauffeur drivers cause more accidents--

734
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,350
反对  骚扰证人
Objection. Badgering.

735
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,180
反对有效
Sustained.

736
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,830
反对  问题具有争论性
Objection. Argumentative.

737
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,600
引导证人
Leading the witness.

738
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,300
问题不明确
Ambiguous.

739
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,820
免责条款
Privileged.

740
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,430
-言论具有煽动性  -反对有效
- Inflammatory. - Sustained.

741
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,390
还有问题吗  桑塔纳先生
Anything further, Mr. Santana?

742
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,360
有  法官大人
Yes, your honor,

743
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,150
我想传召迈克尔・罗斯先生作证
I would like to call to the stand Mr. Michael Ross, please.

744
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,010
在发生事故的那天
What time had you called for the limo

745
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,410
你什么时候叫了豪华轿车
on the morning of the accident?

746
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,820
我们应该是八点半离开的
Uh, we were supposed to leave at 8:30.

747
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,230
那你几点上班
And what time did you get to work?

748
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,880
反对  与本案无关
Objection. Irrelevant.

749
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,550
关系重大  法官大人
It's highly relevant, your honor.

750
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,600
这与司机拉希姆・班加西当时的心理状况有关
It speaks to the psychology of the driver, rahim Benghazi.

751
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,860
反对无效
Overruled.

752
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,620
回答桑塔纳先生的问题
Answer Mr. Santana's question.

753
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,570
八点四十
8:40.

754
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,650
所以说  除非班加西先生在十分钟内赶到
So unless Mr. Benghazi made up for that lost time,

755
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,020
你面谈就会迟到  对吧
you were going to be late for that meeting, correct?

756
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,890
是的
Yes.

757
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,610
讯问完毕  法官大人
No further questions, your honor.

758
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,400
事故发生的时候
When the accident occurred,

759
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,690
你在去执照拍卖会的路上
you were on your way to the medallion auction.

760
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,140
这个拍卖会是在何时何地举行的
When and where was this auction to take place?

761
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,770
早上九点  在市政府
9:00 A.M., city hall.

762
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,950
根据警方的报告
According to the police report,

763
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,230
事故发生在上午8:53
the accident occurred 8:53 a.m.

764
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,740
也就意味着你只有七分钟时间
That means you only had seven minutes

765
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,770
在高峰期开往市中心
to get downtown in rush hour traffic.

766
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,370
反对  与本案无关
Objection, irrelevant.

767
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,420
在我提出同样的反对时
I believe when I made the same objection,

768
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,460
你告诉法官大人"关系重大"
you told his honor it was highly relevant.

769
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,760
反对无效
Overruled.

770
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,650
你也快要迟到了
You were running late,

771
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,150
只不过你迟到的后果比我们更为严重
only the stakes for you were much higher, weren't they?

772
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,380
拍卖会从未准时开始过
These things never start on time.

773
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,720
那为什么在9:03时
Then why was the first medallion

774
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,880
售出了第一个执照
sold 9:03 a.m.?

775
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,710
你担心你拍到执照的机会化为泡影
You were scared your chance at a medallion was going up in smoke,

776
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,460
所以你闯了红灯
and you ran a red.

777
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,960
然后利用事故
Then you used the accident

778
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,600
让我和雷・班加西做替罪羊
to paint me and Ray Benghazi as a couple of scapegoats.

779
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,860
你不能证明这一点
You can't prove that.

780
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:28,700
当时交通灯是什么颜色
What color was the light?

781
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,280
我引用第五修正案[不得要求自证其罪]
I take the fifth.

782
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,960
你不引用第五修正案  桑塔纳先生
You can't take the fifth, Mr. Santana.

783
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,540
这不是刑事调查
This isn't a criminal case.

784
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,570
灯是什么颜色的
What color was the light?

785
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,570
他插到了我前面
He cut me off.

786
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,530
你声称非常拥护我们的法律系统
You claim to love our legal system so much,

787
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,650
请回答问题
answer the question.

788
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,160
灯是什么颜色的
What color was the light?

789
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,400
灯是什么颜色的
What color was the light?

790
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
法官大人
Your honor?

791
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,190
回答这个问题  桑塔纳先生
Answer the question, Mr. Santana.

792
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,760
那对我意义重大
It just meant so much to me.

793
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,230
法官大人
Your honor,

794
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,190
我能和对方律师商量一下吗
can I sidebar with opposing counsel?

795
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,320
我们可以把胜负交给陪审团来判定
We can roll the dice with the jury,

796
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,590
但我更希望进行和解
but I'd rather settle.

797
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,220
好吧  我要赔多少钱
Well, how much would I have to pay?

798
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,330
无需赔偿
Nothing.

799
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,570
你来承担事故的责任
You take responsibility for the accident,

800
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,800
雷的全部损失将由保险公司承担
and your insurance company makes Ray whole.

801
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:23,920
作为回报
In return,

802
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,080
我放弃索要诉讼费的权利
I waive my right to collect legal fees.

803
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,710
我不知道说什么
I don't know what to say.

804
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,080
什么也别说了
Don't say anything.

805
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,540
我得维护自己的名誉
I've got a reputation to maintain.

806
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,780
法官大人  为了您的名誉  请公正裁决
That goes for you too, judge.

807
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,430
真该死  特雷弗  我给你留了五条留言
Damn it, Trevor. I left you like five messages.

808
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,380
你兄弟跟谁都只是玩玩  真好
Good to know your boy's flaky with everyone.

809
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,130
我是来寻私仇的
I was taking it personal.

810
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,380
你想要什么
What do you want?

811
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,440
特雷弗欠我的五万块钱没还
Well, Trevor owes us $50,000 he's never paid,

812
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,980
你得拿钱来赎他
so you're gonna bail him out.

813
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,170
听着  我没那么多钱给你
Listen, I don't have that kind of money, okay? I can't.

814
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,300
如果你一小时内不带着钱过来
Well, if you're not down here in an hour with it,

815
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,920
我们就要特雷弗好看
we're gonna take it out on Trevor.

816
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,750
告诉他钱在哪里
Tell him where the money is.

817
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,240
千万不要露面
Whatever you do, don't show up.

818
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,070
特雷弗
Trevor!

819
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,410
你有一个小时的时间
You have one hour.

820
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,440
喂  喂
Hello? Hello?

821
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,420
你在庭审中途离席
What do you think you're doing,

822
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,940
你觉得那么做合适吗
leaving in the middle of a trial?

823
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,700
我有事要去处理
I got some things to take care of.

824
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,810
你是说有人需要你帮忙吧
You mean someone to take care of.

825
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,420
你从没和特雷弗断绝联系  对吧
You never cut Trevor off, did you?

826
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,010
是啊  没断  我的朋友遇上麻烦了
No, I didn't. My friend's in trouble,

827
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:49,880
我要去帮他
and I'm gonna help him.

828
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,940
你知道吗  瘾君子都是这副德行
You know what? This is what addicts do.

829
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,430
每当事情有点起色  他们就会出岔子
The second they start making progress, they screw up,

830
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,600
因为在惨败之前
because deep down they think

831
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,120
他们深信  成功只是早晚的问题
it's only a matter of time until they fail.

832
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,310
他们宁愿从半山腰掉下来  也不会坚持到山顶
They'd rather fall from the third floor than the penthouse.

833
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,930
你说什么也不能阻止我
Nothing you say can stop me.

834
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,730
那么你就告诉我到底发生了什么事
Then tell me what the hell's going on.

835
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,820
身上没装窃听器
He's clean. No wires.

836
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,970
确定吗
Are you sure?

837
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,320
当然  我很确定
Yeah, I'm sure.

838
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,690
上次那个男人  你就没查出来
You remember what happened with the guy.

839
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,160
他可有三百磅重啊
He was 300 pounds.

840
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,570
你到底是什么身份
Now, who'd you say you were again?

841
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:22,810
特雷弗的律师
Trevor's lawyer.

842
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,550
特雷弗根本没提到他还有个律师
Trevor didn't mention a lawyer.

843
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,180
他不知道自己雇了我
He doesn't know he hired me.

844
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,710
过来
Come on.

845
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,100
把公文包打开
Open the briefcase.

846
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,870
尼玛我要的钱呢
Where's the goddamn money?

847
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,550
这张照片是我公司的安全录像机抓拍的
That photo is a screen shot, taken from my firm's security video.

848
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,340
我们知道了你们的长相
We know what you look like.

849
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,620
如果迈克・罗斯在接下来五分钟里
And if Mike Ross doesn't hear from me

850
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,020
没有收到我的消息  他就会报警了
in the next five minutes, he's calling the police.

851
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,540
不  小子  你过来可不是为了威胁我们的
No, man. You're not comin' in here and threatenin' us.

852
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,470
你被指控犯有绑架罪  敲诈罪和贩毒罪
You're looking at kidnapping, extortion, and drug-dealing,

853
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,130
而我的快速拨号键三
and the district attorney

854
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,380
就能联系到地区检察官
happens to be number three on my speed dial.

855
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,100
既然我们要蹲那么很久的监狱
Well, if we're looking at all that time,

856
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,600
你就再加上一项谋杀罪
you might as well add murder.

857
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,190
我有个更好的主意
I got a better idea.

858
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,250
这是律师聘用合同
Retainer agreement.

859
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,960
你在这把字一签
If you sign right here,

860
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,820
你就是我的客户了
you'll become one of my clients.

861
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,900
到时候即使我想告你
And I won't be able to testify against you,

862
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,400
法律也不允许
even if I wanted to.

863
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,840
钱的问题怎么解决
What about the money?

864
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,390
这个信封里有一万
This envelope contains $10,000.

865
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,600
你就当做是特雷弗欠款的首付金吧
Consider it a down payment on Trevor's debt.

866
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,760
但我要说明一件事
Only here's the thing,

867
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,400
我可从不做无偿的事
I don't do pro bono work.

868
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,550
我的律师聘用合同
And my retainer agreement

869
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,500
正好要求付一万的首付金
requires a down payment of $10,000.

870
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,730
现在  作为你的律师  我的工作是给你提建议
Now, as your attorney, my job is to give you advice.

871
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,910
我的建议就是
So here's the deal.

872
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,310
签了协议
Sign the agreement.

873
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,660
我不是要你别来嘛
I thought I said not to come.

874
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,770
你还记得五年级时欠我的40块吗
Remember that 40 bucks from the fifth grade you owe me?

875
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,060
你要是死了  我找谁要去
If you were dead, how would I collect?

876
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,550
老天
oh, man.

877
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,250
我真抱歉  只是...
I'm sorry, I just...

878
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,640
跟我在一起  你总是麻烦不断
Put you in trouble just by hanging out with you.

879
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,430
那你为什么要这样
So why'd you do it?

880
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,260
因为我是个混蛋
'cause I'm a dick.

881
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,330
你肯定没想到  你把我保释出来没多久
Bet you didn't think you'd have to save my ass

882
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,880
又要救我的命
so soon after bailing me out.

883
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,500
不是我救了你的命
I wasn't the one who saved you.

884
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,120
对  作为你的朋友
Yeah. Well, as a friend,

885
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,180
那家伙还真让我羞愧
the guy puts me to shame.

886
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,350
相信我  哈维不是我朋友
Harvey's not my friend, trust me.

887
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,680
谁信你  他可不是为了我而两肋插刀的
Well, he didn't put his ass on the line because of me.

888
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,580
听着  我已争取将你的罪罚降到了最低
Listen, I pled you down to a misdemeanor--

889
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,210
酗酒和妨害治安罪  我也帮你付了罚金
Drunk and disorderly. And I paid the fine.

890
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,470
我觉得你最好还是
I think it might be a good idea

891
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,050
出城去躲躲吧
if you got out of town for a while.

892
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,490
蒙大拿[美国州名]
Montana.

893
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,460
你不是说想痛改前非嘛
Well, you said you wanted a clean slate.

894
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,230
我觉得你在巴士上呆上20小时就差不多了
I figured 20 hours on a bus ought to do the trick.

895
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,830
那是那是  确实管用
Oh, yeah, it'll do me good.

896
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,570
我回来后
When I get back,

897
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,190
第一个电话会打给谁  你懂的
You know who the first person I'm gonna call is.

898
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,540
对  谁会接电话  你也懂的
Yeah. The one person you know who'll answer.

899
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,470
给你的
For you.

900
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,360
这是什么
What's this?

901
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,470
真高兴你终于无偿受理案件了
I'm very happy you took ray on pro bono.

902
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,220
这样你反而能为我们的服务买单了
You, on the other hand, can afford our services.

903
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,200
你这是要我自己
You want me

904
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,250
花钱雇我自己去为我自己打官司吗
to pay me to represent me?

905
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,950
对呀  一小时一千  总共十小时
Mm-hmm. Ten hours at $1,000 an hour.

906
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,730
还是你自己算算吧
Eh, yeah, I'll let you do the math.

907
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,350
你不是认真的吧
You can't be serious.

908
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,050
那我告诉你我对什么是认真的
I'll tell you what I am serious about.

909
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,950
我听说你终于开始教那孩子本事了
I hear you're finally mentoring the kid.

910
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,810
我不懂你在说什么
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

911
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,020
真的吗  你不懂  我懂
Really, because I understand

912
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,810
你把那个小狗的比喻用到他身上了
that you dropped the puppy analogy on him,

913
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,550
就像当初我对你一样
which is exactly what I used on you.

914
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,100
大概是不经意间说出口的
May have slipped out by accident.

915
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,780
经意不经意并不重要
Well, accident, on purpose,

916
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,780
真正重要的事是
The really important thing is,

917
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,570
我比你高[职位也是]
is that I'm taller than you.

918
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,850
记得要乖
Yeah.

919
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,890
不错  你穿那件更显瘦
Yup, you look much thinner in that.

920
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,450
那事是你嫁祸给我的  是男人就承认
You planted that story, be man enough to own it.

921
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,920
哈维  我可买不通那些小报记者
I don't traffic in the tabloids, Harvey.

922
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,800
但我知道不论是谁嫁祸给你的
But I can see how whoever planted this

923
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,630
肯定觉得很可笑
might find it amusing.

924
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,980
你看  我们伟大的哈维斗士
You know, the great Harvey specter

925
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,310
竟然欺负一个老实的出租车司机
bullying a humble cab driver.

926
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,350
此案必败
I mean, it's a no-win situation, really.

927
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,960
看来你还没听说
Well, maybe you didn't hear.

928
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,980
我赢了这场必败之战
I won the no-win situation.

929
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,000
你难道不懂   如果你没有暗算我
Did it ever occur to you that if you hadn't done that to me,

930
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,650
我会觉得自己欠你的人情
I actually would have owed you one?

931
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,540
如果你没在同事面前羞辱我的话...
Maybe if you didn't humiliate me in front of the associates--

932
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,320
路易  对于一位普通的律师而言
Louis, for an average attorney,

933
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,370
打赢一亿的官司是毕生梦想
100 million is a career case.

934
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,960
如果我耻笑了你
If I'm mocking you,

935
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,530
那说明我认为你高于一般水准
it means I think you're above average.

936
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,400
不过玩减压球  你玩得太简单了
But stress balls? You're making it too easy.

937
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,510
你把特雷弗送上驶向荒野的大巴了
You put Trevor on the bus to the boondocks?

938
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,830
对  我能问你个问题吗
Yeah. Can I ask you a question?

939
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,860
这件事之后  你觉得我还会相信
After all this, you really think I'm still buying

940
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,920
你是个"事不关己  高高挂起"的人吗
the Mr. I-don't-give-a-crap thing?

941
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,320
乔伊送给你一个小纪念品表达感激
Joy sent a little token of her appreciation.

942
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,350
她把你的发型做得恰到好处
She got your hair just right.

943
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,300
她也给你做过这样的娃娃吗
Did she ever make one of these for you?

944
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,080
我不会给你看的
Not that you'll ever see.
