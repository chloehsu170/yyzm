1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,500
《诉讼双雄》前情提要
Previously on Suits

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,180
我签了这个  贿赂指控就没了吗
So I sign this, and the bribery allegations are gone?

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,800
也没人会知道
And no one ever knows a thing.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,450
你从没让我说明钱是做什么的
you never let me tell you what the money was for.

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,760
你没听懂  我说过我不在乎
You didn't listen to me when I told you I don't care.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,490
那你在乎迈克盘问我之后
Well, do you care that after Mike grilled me,

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,860
我对他印象深刻
I was so impressed with him

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,390
好奇我为什么会忘记他吗
that I wonder why I'd forgotten him.

9
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,950
但找不到任何关于他
but I couldn't find any record of him

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,790
听我课的记录
ever being in my class.

11
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,660
就像他们也不会找到任何
Just like they're not gonna find any record

12
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,970
关于你收学生贿赂的记录一样
of you accepting a bribe from a student.

13
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,820
杰西卡
Jessica,

14
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,330
我会帮你保密
your secret is safe with me.

15
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,810
我告诉他你发现了
I told him you found out 

16
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,370
我隐瞒了丹尼尔·哈德曼挪用公款的事
that I covered up Daniel Hardman's embezzlement

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,710
然后你现在想让我保守你的另一个秘密
And now you want me to protect another one of your secrets.

18
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,750
是同一个的秘密  路易
It's the same secret, Louis,

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,090
而且你在其中牵扯深度跟我一样
and you have just as much invested in it as I do.

20
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,420
你还想让我祝贺你上位[吻你戒指]  路易
You want me to kiss the ring, Louis,

21
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,260
在你做了那些事情之后
after what you did?

22
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,560
说得对  我做了
You're damn right I do,

23
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,540
因为我不在乎上位的手段
because I don't care how it got up there.

24
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,230
我的名字现在在墙上
My name is on that wall.

25
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,540
无论你喜欢与否
whether you like it or not.

26
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,320
你觉得这条领带如何
What do you think of this tie?

27
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,190
我觉得
I think...

28
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,940
我想用它把你绑起来
I want to tie you up with it.

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,640
是吗  这是哪来的兴致
Really? And what brought that on?

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,960
不知道  我觉得自己很强势
I don't know. I'm feeling powerful.

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,480
好吧
Okay, well,

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,730
那我们就
then let's make

33
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,420
来  实现  它
that happen.

34
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,520
等等
Wait.

35
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,440
你这是为了跟我缠绵
Is this to do things to me

36
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,060
还是为了拿到遥控器
or just to get control of the remote?

37
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,020
为什么不能两者都有呢
Why can't it be both?

38
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,300
瑞秋  如果你觉得我会让你看着《权力的游戏》
Rachel, if you think I'm gonna let you watch Game of Thrones

39
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,870
还在床上控制着我
while sexually dominating me,

40
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,080
那你就想对了
then you are absolutely right.

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,060
说真的  你怎么兴致这么高昂
Seriously, what's got you feeling so good?

42
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,140
就是觉得如释重负
Oh, it just feels like such a weight off

43
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,220
因为路易已经不...
now that Louis doesn't--

44
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,120
鄙视我了
Despise me?

45
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,120
知道还怎么样能有种如释重负之感吗
Ah, you know what else would feel like a weight off?

46
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,880
别别别
No. No, no, no.

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,560
从没人打固话找我的  除了我父母
Nobody ever calls the landline except my parents.

48
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,020
-如果出事了呢  -没事的
- What if something's wrong? - It's fine.

49
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,900
迈克
Mike.

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,760
好吧
Okay, okay, okay.

51
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,220
喂
Hello.

52
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,120
对  是我
Yeah, this is him.

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,260
嗯  我当然可以去见您
Yeah, of course I can come meet you.

54
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,040
能问问是什么事...喂
Can I ask what this is-- hello?

55
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,210
是谁
Who was it?

56
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,840
吉拉德教授
Professor Gerard.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,170
他要我去见他
He wants me to go meet him.

58
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,500
他说是什么事了吗
Did he say what it was about?

59
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,580
没有  他挂断了
No, he hung up.

60
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,690
他要你什么时候去见他
When does he want you to meet him?

61
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,810
就现在
Right now.

62
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,760
-吉拉德教授  -谢谢你前来
- Professor Gerard. - Thanks for coming.

63
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,560
如果不是要事我也不会打扰你
I wouldn't have bothered you if it wasn't important.

64
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,560
没事  有什么能帮您的
It's not a problem. What can I help you with?

65
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,640
不是我
It's not me.

66
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,680
自由铁路公司的一名前雇员找到了我
A former employee at Liberty Rail reached out to me.

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,180
他称自己因知道事故真实原因而被解雇
He claims he was fired because he knows the real reason for the crash.

68
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,810
真实原因是什么
And what was the real reason?

69
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,220
他不肯说
He wouldn't tell me.

70
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,630
他说了什么
Well, what did he tell you?

71
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,880
足以让我认定  如果无人调查
Enough for me to know it would be unethical

72
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,810
是不道德的
if somebody didn't look into this.

73
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,450
但你不能去调查  所以你想让我和哈维去
But you can't, so you want me to get Harvey to.

74
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,070
是你说服他接了我的案子
Well, you convinced him to look into my case

75
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,160
他当时并不想  不是吗
when he didn't want to, didn't you?

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,300
这不一样  我们不接这种案子
This is different. We don't take cases like this.

77
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,080
或许吧
Maybe,

78
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,250
但我相信你既然能说服哈维
but I believe a man who can convince Harvey

79
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,190
雇佣一个从未上过法学院的人
to hire someone who never went to law school

80
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,300
也能说服他为此事破例
could convince him to make an exception for this.

81
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:23,800
什么
What?

82
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,440
他没告诉你我知道了
He didn't tell you I know.

83
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,500
没有
No, he didn't.

84
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,300
我知道了
Well, I do.

85
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,150
但我要你做这件事  跟我知情
But what I'm asking you to do and me knowing

86
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,380
毫无关系
have nothing to do with each other.

87
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,690
多谢
I appreciate that.

88
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,270
那么你会让他接案子吗
Does that mean that you're gonna tell him to take the case?

89
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,340
我有个更好的主意
I have a better idea.

90
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,220
有空吗
Got a second?

91
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,420
当然  什么事
Of course. What do you need?

92
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,270
我要你签字批准我的度假请求
I'd like you to sign off on my vacation request.

93
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,130
巴黎
Paris.

94
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,610
我从未听你提起过巴黎啊
I've never heard you talk about Paris.

95
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,300
是没有  但我听你提起过
No, but I have heard you talk about it,

96
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,580
所以我要带你去
which is why I'm taking you.

97
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,370
你要邀我跟你一起去巴黎吗
Are you asking me to go to Paris with you?

98
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,790
我已经这么做了
I believe I just did.

99
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,810
杰夫  你知道我
Jeff, do you have any idea

100
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,270
现在有多忙吗
how much is on my plate right now?

101
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,880
我知道  哈维已经答应替你应付一切了
Actually, I do, all of which Harvey has agreed to cover.

102
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,720
你还找了哈维
You went to Harvey with this.

103
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,150
我想先来找你的
Well, I would have come to you first,

104
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,740
但那就不算是个惊喜了
but then it really wouldn't be a surprise.

105
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,560
我想想吧
I'll think about it.

106
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,440
慢慢想
Take all the time you need.

107
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,420
但与此同时
But in the meantime,

108
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,560
我会考虑一下我还可以带这里的谁出去玩
I'll be thinking about who else around here I can take.

109
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,340
是嘛
Really?

110
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,630
你好自信啊
Well, you're awfully sure of yourself.

111
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,310
你以为我没注意到诺玛看我的眼神吗
You think I haven't seen the way Norma looks at me?

112
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,220
还喊我黑种马
Calls me the black stallion.

113
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,910
诺玛
Norma.

114
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,090
接个案子
Taking a case.

115
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,190
什么案子
What kind of case?

116
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,410
管他呢
What does it matter?

117
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,380
如果不是出了问题
Because you wouldn't be announcing it like that

118
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,160
你就不会那么说了
if there wasn't something wrong.

119
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,300
这个案子是吉拉德教授给的
It's a case that came from professor Gerard.

120
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,810
什么
What?

121
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,430
一名自由铁路的前雇员
A man who used to work at Liberty Rail

122
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,540
称事故的真实缘故遭到了掩盖
says the real cause of the crash was covered up.

123
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,650
那就叫他去找
Then refer him to a firm

124
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,640
接告密者案子的律所  我们不接
that takes whistle-blower cases, because we don't.

125
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,690
我不会那么做
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

126
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,310
那就别做  但这里没有
Then don't, but there's a reason

127
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,710
接告密者案子的律师是有原因的
lawyers who take whistle-blower cases don't work here,

128
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,170
因为大公司
and it's because corporations

129
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,980
不喜欢敲诈大师
don't appreciate shakedown artists.

130
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,230
如果不是敲诈呢
And what if this isn't a shakedown?

131
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,260
你怎么知道
And how do you know it isn't?

132
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,120
我只知道无辜者死去了
What I know is that innocent people died--

133
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,560
有母亲  父亲  儿子  女儿
Mothers and fathers and sons and daughters--

134
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,860
如果有人掩盖了事实真相
and if somebody's covering up why that happened

135
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,500
而我则能加以制止  我会做的
and I can stop it, then I'm going to.

136
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,950
我说你不能做
And I said you're not.

137
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,850
你还说吉拉德教授
Well, but you also said that professor Gerard

138
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,050
不知道我的秘密呢
didn't know my secret.

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,270
哈维  我知道他不会说出去
Harvey, I know, I know he'll never tell anyone,

140
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,460
会有人找到一个会说出去的人
but someday, someone's gonna find out who will,

141
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,540
我就完了
and I'll be done.

142
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,280
迈克  他不...
Mike, he's not--

143
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,270
哈维  我陷入这个烂摊子
Harvey, I got into this whole thing

144
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,030
就是为了帮助他人
so that I could try to help people,

145
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,840
我不知道我还有多少时间
and I don't know how much time I have left,

146
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,790
所以求你
so please,

147
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,480
让我尽力去帮助这些人吧
let me try and help these people.

148
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,880
那你得确保
Then you better make damn sure

149
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,020
这个告密者不是在骗人
this whistle-blower isn't full of shit.

150
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,630
早啊  女士
Bonjour, madame.

151
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,990
你用法语问好正合我意
Oh, I'm so glad you started with that French bullshit,

152
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,690
因为我正想跟你说这个
because that's what I want to talk to you about.

153
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,480
我知道
I know.

154
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,570
没想到会有人求我同意带你去巴黎
Never thought I'd have someone ask my permission to take you to Paris.

155
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,350
你很清楚杰夫那不是求你同意
You know damn well that's not what Jeff did.

156
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,730
杰西卡  你究竟想说什么
Jessica, what exactly do you want to talk about?

157
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,100
我想知道你为什么清空了我的安排
I want to know why you cleared my schedule.

158
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,510
因为杰夫要我做的
Because Jeff asked me to,

159
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,600
而且我都不记得你多久没去度假了
and I can't remember the last time you took a vacation.

160
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,230
那你多久没度假了
When's the last time you took a vacation?

161
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,180
在认真谈恋爱的人又不是我
I'm not the one in a serious relationship.

162
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,670
那你就跑来给我当红娘吗
Oh, so you're playing matchmaker for me now?

163
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,810
我没想当红娘
Oh, I'm not playing anything.

164
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,390
是你自己说  你必须做个选择
And you were the one who said you had to choose

165
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,500
到底要雇他  还是要跟他约会
between hiring him and continuing to see him.

166
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,650
我后来改主意了
And then I changed my mind.

167
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,800
我不想你犯我犯过的错误
And I don't want you to make the same mistake I did.

168
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
你指什么
What are you talking about?

169
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,910
我应该多花点时间跟斯科特在一起
I should have taken some time with Scottie.

170
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,730
杰夫和我  跟你和斯科特不一样
Jeff and I are not you and scottie.

171
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,160
杰西卡  你选择去度假
Jessica, take a vacation.

172
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,520
还是不去度假  都随便
Don't take a vacation.

173
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,340
他跑到我这里  求我帮忙
The man came in here, asking me for help

174
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,410
因为他想跟你离开这
because he wants to go away with you,

175
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,460
我答应  是因为我不想阻碍你们
and I said yes because I'm not gonna be the reason he can't.

176
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,440
皮尔逊-斯佩克特  您想接哪里
Pearson Specter, how may I direct your call?

177
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,690
皮尔逊-斯佩克特  您想接哪里
Pearson Specter, how may I direct your call?

178
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,450
-路易  有空吗  -没有
- Louis, do you have a minute? - No, I don't.

179
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,880
好吧  你在干什么
Okay. What are you doing?

180
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,030
皮尔逊-斯佩克特  您想接哪里
Pearson Specter, how may I direct your call?

181
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,880
皮尔逊-斯佩克特  您想接哪里
Pearson Specter, how may I direct your call?

182
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,780
-听到吗  -皮尔逊-斯佩克特  您想接哪里
- You hear? - Pearson Specter, how may I direct your call?

183
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,810
喂  皮尔逊-斯佩克特
Hello? Pearson Specter...

184
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,800
听见了吗
You hear that?

185
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,390
利特呢
Where's the Litt?

186
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,180
每通电话都好像在抽我嘴巴
Every call is like a slap in the face.

187
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,270
路易  名字说得简洁
Louis, it's standard practice for a law firm

188
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,350
是一个律所的标准做法
to shorten their name on the phone.

189
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,540
现在公然蔑视我是标准做法了吗
So blatant disrespect is standard practice now?

190
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,960
那不是蔑视你  那是...
It's not disrespect. It's just...

191
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,150
你是说你父亲
You're telling me that your father doesn't

192
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,100
不让他们在接电话时说
have them answer the phone,

193
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,080
"兰德-考德-赞恩"
"Rand, Kaldore, Zane"?

194
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,270
你还真说对了
Actually, no, he doesn't,

195
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,630
我想你也得承认  大家都尊敬我父亲
and I think you'd agree that people respect my father.

196
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,050
除非你又想说
Unless you want to go back to telling me

197
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,120
他是个不怎么样的律师
that he's a shady lawyer.

198
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,260
得了瑞秋  那时我在气头上
Come on, Rachel, that was when I was mad at you.

199
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,060
我就是为了这个来找你的
Which is actually why I wanted to come and talk to you.

200
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,640
我想感谢你原谅了迈克
I want to thank you for forgiving Mike.

201
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,260
这对我意义重大
It--it means a lot to me.

202
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,770
现在你能别再纠结那个电话
Now, can you stop obsessing over the phone

203
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,970
好好听我说吗
long enough to hear that?

204
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,540
很抱歉  瑞秋
I'm sorry, Rachel,

205
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,710
但我做不到
but I can't.

206
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,740
现在我要去炒了那个前台
And now I have to go rip that receptionist a new ass--

207
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,860
路易  如果你成为冠名合伙人后
Louis, if one of your first acts as name partner

208
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,890
第一个举动就是炒前台
is to rip the receptionist to shreds,

209
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,930
那你余生都会为此悔恨的
you'll regret that for the rest of your life.

210
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,030
随他去吧
Just let it go.

211
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,030
随他去
Let it go.

212
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,020
事情会自己回归正轨
Things will run their course.

213
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,560
瑞秋  你说得对
You know what, Rachel? You're right.

214
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,650
而且  很高兴我们又是朋友了
And by the way, I'm glad that we're friends again.

215
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,990
太好了
Good.

216
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,730
皮尔逊-斯佩克特
Pearson Specter...

217
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,220
哈维  今天下午三点半你要做什么
Harvey, what are you doing at 3:30 this afternoon?

218
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,000
怎么了
Why?

219
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,790
我有大新闻  可又不希望你反应过激
I have some news, and I don't want you to overreact.

220
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,990
什么新闻
What is it?

221
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,700
杰夫瑞·本德尔想见你
Jeffrey Bender wants to meet with you.

222
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,850
他听说我们正处理一个告密者的案子
He heard we're taking a whistle-blower case,

223
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,500
他想让我们放弃
and he wants us to drop it.

224
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,860
放松点  我来处理杰夫瑞·本德尔的问题
Relax, I'll take care of Jeffrey Bender.

225
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,070
等等  你不想
Wait a second, you're not gonna try

226
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,340
在迈克开始闹事之前
to cut Mike's legs out from under him

227
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,140
-先砍掉他的腿吗  -砍了有用吗
- before he even gets started? - What's the point?

228
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,550
反正他会一直烦我  直到我说不会放弃
He'd just bother me until I agreed not to anyway.

229
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,830
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

230
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,500
你哑口无言了
You have no idea what to say.

231
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,170
今天是几号  我要记下来
What's the date today? I want to write this down.

232
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,910
猜怎么着
You know what?

233
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,310
今天七号  月份名称是"去你的"
It's the seventh of kiss my ass,

234
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,400
明天是八号  月份名称是"自己安排你见鬼的会议吧"
and tomorrow is the eighth of set your own goddamn meetings.

235
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,080
那是玛雅人的历法吗
Is that the Mayan calendar?

236
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,910
不是  那是唐娜历法
Nope, that's the Donna calendar.

237
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,620
我要记录在案  我说得你哑口无言了
I got you. For the record, I got you.

238
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,670
好吧  能否再说一次
All right, take me through it one more time.

239
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
很简单
It's simple.

240
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,830
每列车的每节车厢上都装着车轴
There are axles on all the cars in all the trains,

241
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,740
车轴上都有感应器以防车轴过热
And those axles have sensors to make sure they don't overheat.

242
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,080
你是说火车出事
So you're saying that the train crashed

243
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,530
是因为热感应器失灵了
because the heat sensors failed.

244
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,980
我是说所有列车的感应器
I'm saying that all the heat sensors

245
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,430
都失灵了
on the entire fleet were faulty,

246
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,580
而且他们早就知道
and they knew about it.

247
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,610
那你事故前为什么不出面
Then why didn't you come forward with this before?

248
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,850
你问他们因我告密而炒了我之前吗
You mean before they fired me for coming forward with it?

249
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,370
这正好说到我下个问题
Which brings me to my next question.

250
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,930
你过去六年换了四份不同工作
You've had four different jobs in the last six years.

251
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,870
你想说什么
What are you getting at?

252
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,950
我想知道为什么
I want to know why.

253
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,220
我老是搬家
I move around.

254
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,720
这在我们这行不算奇怪
It's not uncommon in my business.

255
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,350
老是搬家  还是工作得不好
Move around or keep failing?

256
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,270
我被炒是因为告密
I got fired for blowing the whistle,

257
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,990
不是因为做不好工作
not for messing up on the job.

258
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,990
你的绩效考核可不是这么说的
That's not what your last performance review says.

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,760
绩效考核算个屁
I don't give a shit what it says.

260
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
他们用它当借口来炒我鱿鱼
They used that as an excuse to fire me,

261
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,330
我告密之前的绩效
and my reviews before I came forward

262
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,140
可是非常好的
passed with flying colors.

263
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,230
我是个可靠的工人
I'm a solid worker.

264
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,440
你以为我是怎么得到这份工作的
How the hell do you think I got this?

265
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,300
我知道你的绩效很好
I know your reviews are stellar.

266
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,320
我需要的是一些其他的
What I need to know is if there's anything out there

267
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,460
我们尚未掌握的资料
that we don't have, 

268
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,510
因为他们会尽其所能地找我们麻烦
because they are gonna come at us any way they can,

269
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,420
而他们一旦动手
and when they do,

270
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,510
出问题的就不是热感应器
it's not gonna be about heat sensors,

271
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,670
而是你了
it's gonna be about you.

272
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,490
我就算做世界上最坏的人也没所谓
Yeah, I don't care if I'm the worst guy in the world.

273
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,310
但我知道  那公司里除我之外
I know I'm not the only guy in that company

274
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,280
还有人知道感应器全都坏了
that knows those sensors are faulty.

275
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,710
你说什么
What are you talking about?

276
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,420
你说有份报告是什么意思
What do you mean, there's a report?

277
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,660
事故之后出的
Done after the crash 

278
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,860
说明了部件缺陷才是事故的真正原因
that showed a defective part was the real cause,

279
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,070
而非设计缺陷
not engineer error.

280
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,170
那个告密的人说的吗
Says the whistle-blower.

281
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,340
这上说的
Says these.

282
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,520
这是指令做报告的备忘录
That's a memo ordering the report

283
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,780
另有封电子邮件能确认它的存在
and another email acknowledging its existence.

284
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,420
我们逮到他们了
We got 'em.

285
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,440
-没错  -安排会面
- We do. - Set a meeting.

286
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,220
让他们去说  然后狠狠逼迫他们一下
Let them do the talking, then drop the hammer,

287
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,030
再在他们搞清被谁狠击之前
and stick a settlement down their throat

288
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,920
安排和解
before they know what hit them.

289
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,330
我很感谢你的建议  哈维
I appreciate the advice, Harvey.

290
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,390
但这次我要亲手掌握定音锤
But this time I'm going in with the hammer in my hand,

291
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,170
我要好好决断一下
And I am coming out swinging.

292
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,270
好吧  伶牙俐齿的  你想要多少
Okay, big talker, how much you asking for?

293
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,330
四千万
40 million.

294
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,900
开玩笑的吧
Are you kidding me?

295
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,250
不费劲就能让他们出十倍于这个的价钱
They'll pay ten times that without even trying.

296
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,850
但如果我要他们承认自己的过失
Not when I tell them they're gonna have to admit

297
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,720
可能就不会了
what they did.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,130
-你疯了吗  -不  没疯
- Are you nuts? - No, I am not.

299
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,450
我们不能封存这份和解
We are not sealing this settlement,

300
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,990
你说话之前我再强调一下  这是我的案子
And before you say another word, this is my case.

301
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,160
我不在乎这是谁的案子
I don't care whose case it is.

302
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,850
他们绝不会承认自己的所作所为
They're never going to admit what they did.

303
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,620
选个高价  随他们封存档案吧
Pick a higher number and let them seal it.

304
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,770
哈维  是你让我证明这不是勒索
Harvey, you told me to prove this wasn't a shakedown.

305
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,190
现在又让我收钱帮他们隐瞒
Now you want me to take money to cover things up?

306
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,910
你知道这叫什么吗  这就是勒索
You know what that is? A shakedown!

307
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,760
无理取闹才叫勒索
A shakedown is when your case has no merit.

308
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,950
这才是正确的处理方法
This is the way things work.

309
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,440
况且  这事悄悄和解
Not to mention, if we quietly settle,

310
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,700
我们就不用担心吓跑客户了
we don't have to worry about scaring away our clients.

311
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,440
所以这才是正确的处理方法
That's why it's the way things work.

312
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,420
哈维  车祸死人了
Harvey, people died in this crash!

313
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,960
无论自由铁路承认什么  他们都无法复生
And they're not coming back, no matter what Liberty Rail admits.

314
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,000
你真是个冷血无情的混蛋
You are such a cold, heartless son of a bitch.

315
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,850
这跟你父母的事无关
And this isn't about your parents,

316
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,770
你可以尽情地逼迫他们
so back them into whatever corner you want,

317
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,820
但等他们拒绝承认自己的所作所为
but when they refuse to admit what they did,

318
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,220
你不许闹到上庭那步
you are not going to trial.

319
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,890
少插手我的案子
Stay out of my case.

320
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,120
真香啊
Something smells delicious.

321
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,340
我在为我们做晚饭  但还得等一会
I'm making us dinner, but it won't be ready for a while.

322
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,680
很好  那我们可以趁这时间
Good, that means we have time

323
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,560
过一遍我的推荐路线
to go over my proposed itinerary.

324
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,830
我不记得答应你了
I don't recall saying yes.

325
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,030
我计划我们可以
I thought that we would start

326
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,380
从罗丹[雕塑家]雕塑展私人游开始
with a private tour of the Rodin.

327
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,590
罗丹啊
Oh, the Rodin.

328
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,120
那个雕塑花园我都去过十几遍了
God, I must have visited that sculpture garden a dozen times.

329
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,040
那幸亏我在那里给我们
Then I'm so glad that I arranged for us to have a picnic

330
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,140
安排了一个野餐
while we're there,

331
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,540
我们可以一边吃
and during that picnic,

332
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,510
一边回忆一周前
we can reminisce about the week before,

333
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,990
我们在拉丁区[法国巴黎]彻夜跳舞的情景
where we danced the night away in the Latin Quarter.

334
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,270
是吗
We did?

335
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,030
或者可以谈谈我们如何在卢瓦尔河谷
Mm, or we'll talk about how we'll end the trip

336
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,820
结束我们的旅程
in the loire valley,

337
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,860
我们在塞纳河上啜饮红酒
where we will sip wine along the Seine.

338
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,340
杰夫  真是完美的旅程  你怎么知道的
Jeff, this trip is perfect. How did you know?

339
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,430
我知道你喜欢巴黎  就从那点开始想
I know you've always loved Paris, so I started there.

340
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,780
后来我联系了你妹妹
And then I called your sister.

341
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,290
都是为了我
You did that for me?

342
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,230
是啊
I did.

343
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,350
那你怎么说
So what do you say?

344
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,220
我说...
I say...

345
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,490
如果你知道我在做什么菜
If you knew what I was cooking,

346
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,400
你就知道我的回答了
you'd already know my answer.

347
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,760
看起来像法国菜
Looks French.

348
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,300
所以你明知道你会答应
So you let me go through all that even though

349
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,730
还跟我欲拒还迎
you knew you were gonna say yes the entire time?

350
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,350
我这么做你不高兴吗
Aren't you glad I did?

351
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,660
当然  杰西卡
Yes, Jessica.

352
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,190
我很高兴
Yes, I am.

353
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,660
唐娜  你来干什么
Donna, what are you doing here?

354
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,800
我来是因为我再也受不了了
I'm here because I can't take it anymore.

355
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,430
什么
What?

356
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,040
这地方一点生机都没有  我再也受不了了
This place has no life, and I can't take it anymore.

357
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,500
你就打算用仙人掌增加生机
And that's gonna add life?

358
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,740
如果我给弄点难照顾的
If I gave you something too needy,

359
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,930
会吓到你  而你会任它死去
it would intimidate you, and you would let it die.

360
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,210
你指望我相信你真是为这事来的吗
You expect me to believe that's why you're really here?

361
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,740
当然没有
Of course not.

362
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,090
我是来阻止你
I'm here to stop you from doing

363
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,740
接下来一小时要做的事
what you're gonna do in an hour:

364
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,040
搞砸迈克的会面
crash Mike's meeting.

365
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,370
唐娜  我不能任由他拿我们的律所冒险
Donna, I can't have him risking our other business.

366
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,000
那只是个委托人  帮忙瞒一下就好
It was one client, and you covered it.

367
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,390
如果他搞上法庭
And if he drags this to trial,

368
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,440
就会涉及到所有委托人了
It will be every client.

369
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,960
-这可不一定  -肯定会
- You don't know that. - Yes, I do.

370
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,350
那就相信他能自己接受这一点
Then trust him to accept that on his own.

371
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,420
-唐娜  -哈维
- Donna-- - Harvey,

372
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,470
你什么时候才能让他自己做主
when are you gonna let him be his own man?

373
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,650
自己做主  他已经失控了
His own man? He's out of control.

374
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,630
他把那些受害人当成了自己的父母
He's identifying these people with his parents.

375
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,020
而你失控是因为你无法
And you're out of control because you can't

376
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,360
让自己跟他分离开
separate yourself from him.

377
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,860
你别管这件事
Okay, you need to stay out of it.

378
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,930
我不管  但你说过吉利斯工业的案子
And I will, but you said you made a mistake

379
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,240
你没信任他是个错误
not trusting Mike with Gillis Industries.

380
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,370
我是在提醒你别再犯同样的错误
I'm telling you, don't make that mistake again.

381
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,550
这里是皮尔逊-斯佩克特律所  您找哪位
Pearson Specter, how may I direct your call?

382
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,040
兰德-考德-赞恩律所
Rand, Kaldore, Zane.

383
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,310
混蛋
Son of a bitch!

384
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,220
你好  骗子
Hello, liar.

385
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,420
-你说什么  -兰德-考德-赞恩
- Excuse me? - Rand, Kaldore, Zane.

386
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,290
知道这是什么吗
You know what that is?

387
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,760
这是兰德-考德-赞恩律所的前台应答语
That's how they answer the phone at Rand, Kaldore, Zane.

388
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,030
-路易  对不起  -收起你的假惺惺
- Louis, I'm sorry. - Oh, save your sorrys.

389
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,460
你认识前台那个接待员吗
Do you know the receptionist at the front desk?

390
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,070
认识  她叫爱丽丝
Yes, her name is Elise.

391
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,190
很好  等你辞了她你可以用这个名字
Good, you can use her name when you fire her.

392
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,370
我无权解雇别人
I don't have the authority to fire people,

393
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,910
但我刚跟她谈过
But I did just talk to her.

394
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,830
是吗
You did?

395
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,000
让她改正了  那就好
To set her straight. That's good.

396
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,200
不  不好
No, not good.

397
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,560
她主动来找我
She came to see me.

398
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,980
她说你一直在骚扰她
She said that you've been harassing her.

399
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,280
什么
What happened?

400
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,850
她说你打给她然后挂断了50多次
She said that you called and hung up on her over 50 times.

401
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,050
什么  她怎么知道是我
What? How did she even know it was me?

402
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,280
因为是你的办公室座机号
Because you called from your office.

403
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,320
那也不叫骚扰  因为无关性事
Well, it wasn't harassment because it wasn't sexual.

404
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,840
她还说你出电梯的时候
Well, she also said that you were leering at her

405
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,400
总向她抛媚眼
when you stepped off the elevator.

406
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,070
我才没有
I wasn't leering!

407
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,520
我是为她接电话时说的话感到生气
I was mad about how she answered the phone.

408
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,820
路易  你为什么那么做不重要
Louis, it doesn't matter why you did it.

409
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,210
她觉得被侵犯了
She felt violated.

410
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,580
不如你去告诉她实情
Well, you know what, you tell her it's not like that,

411
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,020
然后把她踹出门去
and then you violate her ass out the door.

412
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,020
路易  你就想当个这样的冠名合伙人吗
Louis, is this really the kind of name partner you want to be?

413
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,520
不  我想当一个前台接电话时
No, I want to be the kind of name partner

414
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,520
大声念出名字的冠名合伙人
that has his name said on the goddamn phone.

415
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,260
那么为了解雇她
Okay, well, in order to fire her

416
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,610
并避免遭到骚扰起诉
without getting sued for harassment,

417
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,290
你就得解雇所有客服人员
you'd have to fire the entire support staff,

418
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,120
你我都清楚  这是不可能发生的
and you and I both know that that's never going to happen.

419
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,760
我们不能解雇所有客服人员
We are not firing all of our support staff.

420
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,670
你的名字排第一个  你当然站着说话不腰疼
Well, it's easy for you to say, being that your name is first.

421
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,600
你在说什么...
What are you talking--

422
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,690
杰西卡  我说的是尊重
Jessica, I am talking about respect.

423
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,440
尊  重  你好好想想它对我的意义
R-e-s-p-e-c-t, find out what it means to me.

424
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,510
但我猜我还是自己想办法
But I guess I'll just find my own way

425
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,370
得到自己应得的尊重吧
to be treated how I deserve.

426
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,940
我知道我会后悔这么问
I know I'm gonna regret asking this.

427
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,370
路易  你究竟在说什么
Louis, tell me specifically what it is you're talking about.

428
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,850
前台接电话说的是"皮尔逊-斯佩克特"
They are answering the phones, "Pearson Specter,"

429
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,480
而不是"皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所"
Not "Pearson Specter Litt."

430
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,440
路易
Louis--

431
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,740
你不相信  你自己听
You don't believe me? Check it yourself.

432
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,070
我不会去骚扰客服人员
I'm not harassing our support staff.

433
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,440
这不是骚扰
It's not harassment, god damn it!

434
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,100
路易
Louis!

435
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,090
杰西卡  我感觉他们故意
Jessica, it's like they've been specifically instructed

436
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,490
落下我的名字的
to leave my name off.

437
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,440
你想太多了
Now you're just being paranoid.

438
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,310
不是我想太多  他们只是没适应过来
I am not paranoid. They're in lockstep.

439
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,440
肯定有人买通他们这么干的
I'm telling you, someone paid them off.

440
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,960
路易  这太疯狂了
Louis, that's insane,

441
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,730
但是如果你想要他们报你的名字
But if you want them to say your name,

442
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,540
我会让他们报你名字的
I will get them to say your name.

443
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,150
杰西卡  有什么需要帮忙吗
Jessica, what can I do for you?

444
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,650
你可以向我解释一下为什么你付钱
You can explain to me why you paid our reception staff

445
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,010
让前台接电话的时候别说路易的名字
not to say louis' name when they answer the phone.

446
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,150
-谁说是我干的  -他们说的
- Who says I did that? - They do.

447
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,450
妈的
God damn it.

448
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,000
我给他们好大一笔  让他们瞒路易
I paid them good money to keep louis

449
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,380
至少一个月
from finding out for at least a month.

450
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,750
他的确没发现
He hasn't found out.

451
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,060
不是他让他们开的口  是我
It wasn't him who got them to crack, it was me.

452
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,040
就算是这样  我也要求退款
Even still, I'm asking for a refund.

453
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,230
杰夫  我很认真
Jeff, I'm serious about this.

454
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,080
我知道你对路易名字上墙的方式很不齿
I know you're pissed about how he got his name on the door,

455
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,690
但我需要你停战和解
But I need you to bury the hatchet.

456
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,460
-我没打算停战  -为什么不呢
- Well, I'm not gonna do that. - Why not?

457
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,520
因为每次看到他那张贼眉鼠眼的脸
Because every single time I see his rat face,

458
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,020
我就会想到他敲诈了你
I think about him blackmailing you,

459
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,240
这让我想上去
And it makes me want to walk over to him

460
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,590
把他俩胳膊都卸了
and rip his arms off his body,

461
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,030
那个小小的电话恶作剧只是
and that little phone prank was just my way

462
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,290
我防止自己暴力行为的方法
of keeping myself from doing something like that.

463
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,410
我懂你
I understand,

464
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,280
也很感谢你这样做
and I do appreciate it,

465
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,710
但是我并不是要求你为他而和解
But I'm not asking you to do it for him.

466
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,260
是为了我
I'm asking you to do it for me.

467
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,140
罗斯先生
Mr. Ross.

468
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,450
我对你文件的想法就是
All I can say about your filing is that I think

469
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,440
你很有写科幻小说的前途
you might have a career writing fiction.

470
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,830
可你要是不提交那份我们需要的报告
And if you don't hand over that report we're requesting,

471
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,570
你就会有蹲大狱的前途了
You're gonna have a career behind bars.

472
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,070
你来不是为了那份报告
You're not here for that report.

473
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,370
而是为了我委托人数目可观的支票
You're here to strong arm my client into a big, fat check.

474
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,730
很抱歉是由我来告诉你
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this,

475
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,570
但巨额支票也不能帮你们摆脱此事
but a big, fat check isn't gonna get you out of this.

476
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,110
-是这样吗  -废话当然了
- Is that a fact? - Sure as hell is,

477
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,510
因为我们都知道  那份报告
Because we both know that report

478
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,870
声明你们对这起事故负责
says you're responsible for this accident,

479
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,040
但是除非你们承认  否则和解免谈
and we're not settling anything without you admitting it.

480
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,190
但是我们不会承认根本没做的事情
And we're not admitting something we didn't do.

481
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,800
这是什么
What the hell is this?

482
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,090
你说你想要报告
Well, you wanted the report.

483
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,150
给你了
Here it is.

484
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,530
你的委托人说它存在不是假话
Your client wasn't lying about its existence.

485
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,700
但其他内容就都是骗人了
He was just lying about everything else.

486
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,520
我们对热感应器进行了反复测试
We ran repeated tests on our heat sensors,

487
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,090
每一次它们都通过了
And they passed every one.

488
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,450
你胡说
This is bullshit.

489
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,450
在胡说的是
The only thing that's bullshit

490
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,880
乔·亨德森
is Joe Henderson.

491
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,780
他根本就不在乎事故
He doesn't care about the accident.

492
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,370
他只是想敲诈我们
All he's trying to do is shake us down,

493
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,870
一如他之前四份工作中的行为
Exactly like he did at his last four jobs.

494
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,890
那又是什么
What the hell is that?

495
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,490
他之前的四桩官司
His last four lawsuits.

496
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,760
你觉得就因为记录都封存了
Did you think we wouldn't find out about them

497
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,320
我们就找不出了吗
just because the records were sealed?

498
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,240
罗斯先生  你的委托人
Mr. Ross, your client's been playing

499
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,610
一直都在玩告密的把戏
The whistle-blower lottery for years.

500
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,080
他从来没赢过
He's never won before.

501
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,820
这次也不会赢
He's not going to win today.

502
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,340
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch,

503
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,360
你每做一份工作
you tried to blow the whistle

504
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,880
都会告发泄密  现在他们知道了
at every job you've ever had, and now they know it!

505
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,840
小声点
Keep your voice down.

506
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,450
你  不  等你不拿瞎话应付我了
You-- no, I'll keep my voice down

507
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,000
我再小声点
when you stop bullshitting me.

508
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,400
那些声明本应该是被封存的
Those claims were supposed to be sealed.

509
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,190
我不在乎它们本来应该怎样
I don't care what they were supposed to be.

510
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,180
他们找到了  你本该在这之前告诉我
They found them, and you were supposed to tell me about them.

511
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,100
如果我说了  你会怎么做呢
And what would you have done if I did?

512
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,250
我会跟他们说一样的话
I would've said what they said,

513
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,200
你根本不在乎他们做了什么
that you don't give a shit about what they did!

514
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,560
你只是想借此生财罢了
You're just looking to get rich.

515
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,410
你觉得我会拿我的工作和一切
You think I would've risked my job

516
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,580
去冒险求那虚无缥缈的东西吗
and everything that I have for nothing?

517
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,800
你说什么
Excuse me?

518
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,630
我说了  我没看出你那一千块西服里
I said, I don't see you working out of the goodness

519
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,560
包着出于善意而工作的心
of your heart in your $1,000 suit.

520
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,910
你根本不了解我  也不知道我做事的动机
You have no idea who I am or why I do things.

521
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,970
现在我告诉你  你不需要担心我的过去
And I told you, you don't have to be concerned about my history

522
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,160
因为我告诉你的都是实话
because what I'm telling you is true.

523
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,420
照这个来看可不是
Not according to this.

524
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,110
你说这份报告能让我们抓住他们的把柄
That's the report that you said gave us all the leverage

525
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,250
但是他们却说它证明了他们的清白
and they say proves them innocent.

526
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,060
那份报告在胡扯
That report is bullshit,

527
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,640
因为我跟你说  那些感应器不管用
because I'm telling you, those sensors didn't work,

528
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,270
而那就是事故的起因
and that was the cause of that accident.

529
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,520
要是你之前信誉好点
Well, I might have a leg to stand on

530
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,770
我还有点理由支持你
if you had any credibility at all.

531
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,530
现在我自己都不信你
How the hell am I supposed to get a jury to believe you

532
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,300
我又怎么让陪审团信你
when I'm not even sure I do?

533
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,380
你来这干嘛
What are you doing here?

534
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,670
我来告诉你该给前台打电话了
I'm here to tell you to call the front desk.

535
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,130
让我猜猜
Oh, let me guess.

536
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,340
杰西卡告诉你他们不肯把我的名字一起报出来
Jessica told you they won't say my name

537
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,750
你觉得这很好笑
and you thought it was hilarious.

538
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,810
你说对了  很好笑
You're right, I did.

539
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,980
你为什么不滚出我的办公室
Why don't you get the hell out of my office

540
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,830
滚到其它地方笑去呢
and go laugh somewhere else?

541
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,390
你这是想打我了
Oh, you want to hit me now?

542
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,530
呵呵  去问问迈克·罗斯我的锁喉术怎么样
Yeah, well, why don't you go ask Mike Ross about my headlock?

543
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,480
因为哥像老虎钳一样
'cause it's a goddamn vice.

544
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,890
皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律师事务所
Pearson Specter Litt,

545
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,390
请问转接哪位律师
How may I direct your call?

546
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,030
是你干的
It was you.

547
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,670
对  是我干的
Yes, it was me,

548
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,330
但我已经把它改正了  所以...
But I fixed it, so...

549
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,110
你可以不用再担心律所的人是否尊敬你了
You can stop worrying if everybody at the firm respects you,

550
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,920
因为他们的确尊敬你
because they do.

551
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,720
除了你
Everyone except you.

552
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,440
不  路易  包括我
No, Louis, including me.

553
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,790
我可能看不惯你名字上墙的方式
Listen, I may not like how you got your name on the wall,

554
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,410
但那不代表你的名字不应该在上面
But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be up there.

555
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,450
恭喜  路易
Congratulations, Louis.

556
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,990
谢谢  杰夫
Thanks, Jeff.

557
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,440
我们这周是不是还能约个酒呢
Hey, maybe we can even get drinks this week.

558
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,330
-谁冠名谁买单  -成交
- Name partner buys. - Deal.

559
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,730
说好了
Done.

560
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,150
咖啡可以留下  但我不会起来的
You can leave the coffee, but I'm not getting up.

561
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,990
迈克  你已经连续工作7个小时了
Mike, you've been working for seven hours straight.

562
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,590
-你需要休息  -我之所以工作7个小时
- You need a break. - I've been working for seven hours

563
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,410
是因为如果我在想出解决办法之前
because if I tell Harvey

564
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,010
告诉哈维发生的事情
What's going on before I have a fix,

565
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,210
他就要终止这件事了
He is gonna pull the plug.

566
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,000
那可能这件事是该结束了
Well, then maybe the plug needs to be pulled.

567
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,550
瑞秋  就因为乔·亨德森
Rachel, just because Joe Henderson is

568
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,710
是个满嘴胡话的原告并不代表着
a bullshit plaintiff doesn't mean

569
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,070
他们没有掩饰什么事情
they didn't cover things up.

570
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,520
也不代表他们真的隐瞒了什么
It doesn't mean that they did.

571
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,080
那好吧
Okay, fine.

572
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,460
如果他明知道那份报告对案子无益
Why would he ask for that report

573
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,230
为什么还会要呢
if he knew it would hurt our case?

574
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,670
-我不懂  -我也不懂
- I don't know. - I don't know either,

575
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,070
所以我才需要更多的时间
which is why I need more time.

576
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,970
那你就得去说服哈维让你继续跟下去
Well, then you need to convince harvey to let you keep going,

577
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,900
要是你不说而他又发现了的话...
because if you don't and he finds out--

578
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,410
不会被他发现的
He is not gonna find out.

579
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,490
迈克  我是不会告诉他的
Mike, he's not gonna find out from me,

580
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,630
但就这六个月来我在这里的经验
But if I've learned one thing in the last six months

581
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,370
如果他从别人那知道了这事
of working here, it's that if he finds out from somebody else,

582
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,160
你会后悔的
you're gonna regret it.

583
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,620
是来告诉我你决定要度假了吗
You come here to tell me you're taking that vacation?

584
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,470
我是来问问迈克·罗斯什么时候
I came by to ask when Mike Ross started taking

585
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,570
接了那桩告密者的案子
whistle-blower cases.

586
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,420
杰西卡
Jessica--

587
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,800
我希望你能在此事失控前
I want you to put the brakes on him

588
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,950
就阻止他干傻事
before this gets out of control.

589
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,590
我不会那么做
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

590
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,740
-哈维  -杰西卡  只是个案子而已
- Harvey. - Jessica, it's one case.

591
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,390
他要我信任他  我也打算这么做
He asked me to trust him, and I'm gonna do it,

592
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,460
而且如果你要想好好度个假
and if you're ever gonna be able to enjoy a vacation,

593
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,060
就要信任我
you're gonna have to trust me.

594
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,250
好吧  晚安
All right. Good night.

595
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,320
一路顺风
Bon voyage.

596
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,830
你知道这句话的意思不是晚安对吧
You do know that doesn't mean "Good night."

597
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,390
当然了
Of course I do.

598
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,500
那你知道法语怎么说晚安吗
Do you know how to say "Good night" in French?

599
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,970
怎么  你觉得我是个原始人吗
What, do you think I'm some kind of neanderthal?

600
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,530
你一句法语都不会说  对吧
You don't know one word of French, do you?

601
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,890
三口之家
Mennage en trois.

602
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,000
你这个蠢货
You're an idiot.

603
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,480
四口之家
Mennage en quatre.

604
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,890
五口之家
Mennage en cinq.

605
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,690
我能进来吗
Can I come in?

606
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,000
怎么回事啊
What's going on?

607
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,010
我们有麻烦了
We have a problem.

608
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,170
说吧
I'm listening.

609
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,720
自由铁路公司报告直接否定了我们的立论
Liberty Rail's report directly contradicts our claim.

610
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,110
那确实是个大麻烦
That's a big damn problem.

611
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,750
我相信我的委托人  哈维
I believe my client, Harvey.

612
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,940
根据什么相信  直觉吗
Based on what, your gut?

613
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,980
不  我找到了写报告的人
No, I found the guy who wrote the report.

614
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,410
他去澳大利亚了  假期时长不定
He's on indefinite leave in Australia,

615
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,890
所以我们无法传唤他
where we can't subpoena him.

616
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,060
那双方一样口说无凭啊
So it's our word against theirs.

617
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,210
所以我才来找你
Which is why I'm here.

618
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,970
乔·亨德森过去六年中索赔了四次
Joe Henderson made four other claims in the last six years.

619
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,060
-你玩儿我呢吧  -哈维
- You're shitting me. - Harvey--

620
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,950
够了  我要结束这个案子
That's it. I'm pulling the plug.

621
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,330
我就知道
I knew it.

622
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,430
我就知道只要稍微遇到一点挫折
I knew you would bail on me the second this thing

623
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,820
你就会丢下我不管
hit the smallest bump.

624
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,710
丢下你不管
Bail on you?

625
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,710
我支持你是因为你告诉我你会赢
I backed you because you told me you had a case.

626
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,130
我可以赢  我说了是他们买通了出报告的人
I do have a case. I told you they got to this guy.

627
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,450
但你没法证明
And you got no proof of that.

628
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,500
如果这是你的案子
And if this were your case,

629
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,490
你肯定会求我帮你打下去
you would be begging me for help to get it.

630
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,060
但现在这不是我的  是你的
It's not my case. It's yours.

631
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,620
现在你要让陪审团相信
And now you're asking a jury

632
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,060
是这些人伪造了报告
to believe these guys fabricated a report

633
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,070
就凭一个职业告密者的话
based on the word of a career whistle-blower.

634
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,970
不  我是在要求你相信
No, I'm asking you to believe it.

635
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,320
我信什么不重要
It doesn't matter what I believe.

636
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,440
这人就是个勒索犯
This guy is a goddamn shakedown artist,

637
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,310
我要叫停
and I'm pulling the plug.

638
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,660
我不在乎他是什么
I don't care what he is.

639
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,170
但我不是个勒索犯
I'm not a goddamn shakedown artist!

640
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,910
-迈克  -哈维  你跟我说过
- Mike -- - Harvey, you told me that 

641
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,190
这些人不是我的父母
those people weren't my parents,

642
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,220
但他们总是某些人的父母
but they are somebody's parents.

643
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,950
拜托了
Please.

644
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,910
再给你24小时
You got 24 hours.

645
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,860
你知道乱丢垃圾是违法的对吧
You know it's against the law to litter, don't you?

646
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,000
有事吗  唐娜
What do you want, Donna?

647
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,450
我知道你去见哈维了
I know you went to see Harvey.

648
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,290
你知道他就是希望我失败
You know that he wants me to fail.

649
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,120
不是这样的
That's not true.

650
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,210
现在我毫无头绪  而他就只给了我一天
I don't have anything, and he only gave me a day.

651
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,140
但如果他希望你失败
And if he wanted you to fail,

652
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,100
就一秒也不会给你
he wouldn't have given you another second.

653
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,550
你知道他觉得我这么做是因为我父母对吧
You know he thinks this is about my parents, right?

654
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,910
那是吗
Is it?

655
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,640
也许吧
Maybe it is,

656
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,710
但这些人的所作所为更可恨
but what these people did is a million times worse

657
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,930
因为他们知道会发生这样的情况
because they knew it could happen.

658
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,470
等等  他们知道会发生这样的事
Wait a second -- they knew this could happen,

659
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,740
却没有修理吗
and they didn't fix it before?

660
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,000
没错  唐娜  而且他们决定赌运气
Yeah, Donna, and then they -- they rolled the dice.

661
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,980
那现在怎么办
Well, what about now?

662
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,090
那些火车还是残次品吗
Are those trains still messed up?

663
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,420
因为如果这样  那他们禽兽不如
Because that would make them monsters.

664
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,490
他们是禽兽不如  但不修理就是犯傻
They are monsters, but that would also make them idiots,

665
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,530
但他们不傻
and they're not idiots.

666
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,580
你什么意思
Well, what are you talking about?

667
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,250
他们现在肯定已经修好传感器了
Well, they must have fixed the sensors by now;

668
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,100
否则如果再出事  他们就得进监狱
Otherwise if it happened again, they'd all go to jail.

669
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,940
那如果他们修好了传感器
Well, if they fixed the sensors, 

670
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,300
肯定有份纸质的报告存在
then there has to be - a paper trail.

671
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,990
当然有了
Of course there is.

672
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,280
那你只要找到就好了
Then all you have to do is get it.

673
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,510
你以为我一晚上都在干什么
What do you think I've been trying to figure out all night?

674
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,340
找文件干什么呀  传讯报告人就好了呀
What's to figure out? Subpoena it.

675
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,520
只有一个小问题  哈维只给了我一天
Yeah, there's only one problem. Harvey only gave me 24 hours.

676
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,670
但现在你有了头绪
But now that you've come up with this,

677
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,100
也许哈维会改主意呢
maybe Harvey will change his mind.

678
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,390
唐娜  我的理论是我无法证明
Donna, I have a theory that I can't prove and an opposition

679
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,190
而且我的敌人还可以篡改证据
that's shown they're willing to alter evidence.

680
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,360
他不会改主意的  这你也清楚
He's not gonna change his mind, and you know it.

681
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,400
总有其他办法的
There's got to be another way.

682
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,870
唐娜  我很感激你想帮忙的心
Donna, look, I appreciate what you're doing,

683
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,890
但除非你有办法解决此事
but unless you have this other way in your pocket, 

684
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,130
否则就别打扰我了
please, just leave me alone 

685
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,090
让我自己想办法解决吧
and let me try and think this thing through.

686
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,710
不  我才不管他怎么说
No! I don't care what he says.

687
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,320
这可是个在查案件
It's an active goddamn investigation,

688
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,280
-而且我也不打算  -这儿不能打电话
- and I'm not gonna stand around -- - You can't talk on that here.

689
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,680
稍等一下  查理
Hang on a second, Charlie.

690
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,740
抱歉  我们这个招呼打得不太愉快
I'm sorry, we got off on the wrong foot.

691
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,220
你是叫丹妮尔吗
Is your name Danielle?

692
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,260
牌子上不是都写着吗
That's what it says on the plate, isn't it?

693
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,080
丹妮尔  我是来取文件的
Well, Danielle, I'm here to pick up the documents

694
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,200
我一小时前要过了  如果15秒内
I ordered an hour ago, and if you don't give them to me

695
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,510
你还不给我
in the next 15 seconds,

696
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,080
今天就是你工作的最后一天
today's gonna be your last day.

697
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,110
你没跟我要过
You didn't talk to me.

698
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,060
我说稍等  真是的
I said hold on, damn it.

699
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,950
听着  我没时间跟你玩躲猫猫
Look, I don't have time to play "Who spoke To who."

700
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,690
我从华盛顿跑到这儿来
I am up from DC because, as it is,

701
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,000
是因为我要的文件没有按时送到
these documents weren't sent when they were promised.

702
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,050
-抱歉  你要什么来着  -天哪
- I'm sorry. What is it you need again? - Oh, Jesus Christ.

703
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,380
过去六个月以来的所有维修订单
All the maintenance work orders from the past six months.

704
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,600
没有授权我不能给你
I can't let you have that without authorization.

705
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,830
那好啊  不如现在就给你上司打电话
Well, then by all means, let's call your supervisor,

706
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,490
我们可以顺便告诉他你在这儿玩开心农场
and we can tell him how you'd rather play Farmville

707
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,120
耽误着我的事
than cooperate with me.

708
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,680
你说你是哪来的
Who did you say you're with again?

709
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,320
你听说过国家运输管理局吗
Have you heard of the National Transportation Safety Board?

710
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,110
里面的人会给你想要的文件
They'll give you what you need in the back.

711
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,620
你做了什么
What did you do?

712
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,050
什么也没做啊  你呢
I didn't do anything. What did you do?

713
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,800
别跟我闹  这是此案胜败的关键
Don't give me that. This makes my entire case,

714
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,030
但如果不知道是从哪来的我就没法用
but I can't use it if I don't know where it came from.

715
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,130
看起来好像是来自自由铁路公司的哦
Oh, that looks like it came from Liberty Rail.

716
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,650
那它就突然自己
Oh, oh, yeah, it just happened to walk itself

717
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,790
穿过他们的安保设施跑出来了
over from their secure facility.

718
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,760
也许是有人去了一趟
Well, it's possible that somebody went over there

719
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,750
把它从安保设施里放出来了
and released it from their secure facility.

720
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,780
唐娜  如果我拿着这个去找哈维
Donna, if I go to Harvey with this

721
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,600
告诉他我知道的事  他...
and tell him what I know happened, he--

722
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,010
你不知道  你只是猜测
You don't know. You think.

723
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,980
别跟我玩律师抠词那套  他不会让我用的
Don't lawyer me. He'll never let me use it.

724
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,180
那就别告诉他你猜测的事
Well, then don't tell him what you think happened,

725
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,660
因为如果你说了  他会让你放弃案子
because if you do, he'll make you drop the case.

726
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,860
好吧  眼下  我不关心案子
Okay, right now, I don't care about the case.

727
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,970
我关心你
I care about you.

728
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,540
迈克  我没偷东西
Mike, I didn't steal anything.

729
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,090
我说服对方让我进去了  事情就是这样
I talked my way in, and that's what happened.

730
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,270
你跟他们说这是要发掘一个
Did you tell them this was discovery

731
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,600
针对他们的案子吗
for a case against them?

732
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,450
-没有  -那这材料在庭上是不能采纳的
- No. - Then it's not admissible in court.

733
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,780
那你得想个办法
Well, then you have to figure out a way

734
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,940
不要在庭上用它
to use it not in court,

735
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,600
但别让我帮你想
but don't ask me for my help on that.

736
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,030
我做的已经够多了
I have done enough.

737
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,670
听说你想见我
Heard you wanted to see me.

738
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,020
我听说你跟路易·利特和好了
I take it you patched things up with Louis Litt.

739
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,010
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

740
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,520
他想知道你是喜欢运动酒吧
Oh, he wanted to know if you were a sports bar guy

741
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,910
还是葡萄酒吧
or a wine bar guy.

742
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,050
你告诉他我其实更喜欢脱衣舞吧吗
Did you tell him I'm more of a strip club kind of guy?

743
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,300
你真的想跟路易·利特去脱衣舞吧吗
You really want to go to a strip club with Louis Litt?

744
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,740
我其实不想跟任何人去脱衣舞吧
I don't really want to go to a strip club with anyone,

745
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,870
但我10分钟后确实要见个人
but I do have a meeting in 10 minutes,

746
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,830
但见面地点离这里有15分
and it's 15 minutes away.

747
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,960
我只是想告诉你
Oh, I just wanted to tell you

748
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,360
我很感激你跟他和好了
that I appreciate you patching things up with him.

749
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,970
不用谢我
There's no need to thank me.

750
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,400
为我爱的人做什么都愿意
I would do anything for the woman that I love...

751
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,070
跟路易·利特喝酒都行
even get a drink with Louis Litt.

752
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,030
你是来说安德顿软件的事吗
You here to talk about Anderton Software?

753
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,510
你自由铁路的24小时时限已经到了
Because your 24-hour Liberty Rail pass is up.

754
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,510
那我猜我刚收到这封邮件
Then I guess it's a good thing

755
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,330
是个好消息
that just came in the mail for me.

756
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,350
这是什么
What is it?

757
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,390
维修记录
Maintenance records showing

758
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,670
证明他们在出轨时间后6周内
they replaced the heat sensors on all of their trains

759
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,160
更换了所有列车的热传感器
within six weeks after the derailment.

760
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,080
如果他们安全检查没出错  为什么要换呢
Now, why would they do that if they never failed a safety test?

761
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,700
没出错就不会换
They wouldn't.

762
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,410
所以乔·亨德森说的是对的
Which means Joe Henderson was telling the truth.

763
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,920
我能想到他们会用3种方式
I can think of three different ways

764
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,080
解释这行为
they'll explain this away.

765
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,890
除非我们可以在他们发觉前把它记录在案
Not if we can get them on record before they know we have it.

766
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,170
为什么他们不知道我们拿到了这个
And why don't they know we have it?

767
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,580
跟我不知道他们拿到了
The same way I didn't know they got

768
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,690
乔·亨德森的密封记录一个原因
Joe Henderson's sealed records.

769
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,460
这说明你用了点不光明的小手段
Which means you did something sketchy.

770
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,470
哈维  你想花一晚上时间
Harvey, do you want to spend all night asking me 

771
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,260
拷问我知道什么不知道什么
exactly what I did or did not do,

772
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,390
还是帮我纠正一件错误的事
or do you want to help me right a wrong?

773
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,090
唐娜
Donna?

774
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,310
跟自由铁路预约取证会
Set a deposition with Liberty Rail,

775
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,180
告诉他们这次不光迈克出席
and tell them this time it won't just be Mike.

776
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,420
马上去
I'm on it.

777
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,630
那是谁
Who the hell is that?

778
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,080
自由铁路的首席执行官
That's the CEO of Liberty Rail.

779
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,230
我知道他是谁  但她呢
Yeah, I know who he is. Who is she?

780
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,580
是他们的律师
That's their lawyer.

781
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,770
你怎么不告诉我她这么辣
Why didn't you tell me she was hot?

782
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,120
因为那跟案件没关系
Because it's not relevant.

783
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,680
-对我来说有关系  -为什么
- It is to me. - Why?

784
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,010
因为她很辣
Because she's hot.

785
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,580
你肯定就是著名的哈维·斯佩克特了
You must be the infamous Harvey Specter.

786
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,730
-你一定是...  - 伊凡·施密斯
- You must be-- - Evan Smith.

787
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,360
我得承认  看到你叫伊凡时
Have to admit, when I saw your name was Evan,

788
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,780
我以为你是男性
I thought you were a man.

789
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,620
我也得承认  看到你叫哈维时
And I have to admit, when I saw your name was Harvey,

790
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,920
我以为你是男性
I thought you were a man.

791
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,380
-我觉得我恋爱了  -我也觉得你是
- I think I'm in love. - I think you are too.

792
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,910
我们赶紧结束  开始正事吗
Okay, can we get this over with?

793
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,250
当然可以
We sure can.

794
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,370
我都不知道你们还能有什么问题
I don't even know how you have any questions at all,

795
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,470
上次会议已经那样了
given our last meeting.

796
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,880
只有几个问题
We just have a few.

797
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,820
麦金泰尔先生  在出轨事件前
Mr. McIntyre, before the derailment,

798
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,860
自由铁路进行了列车热传感器的检测工作
Liberty Rail conducted tests on the heat sensors on its trains.

799
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,010
是吗
Is that correct?

800
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,630
-当然  -为什么要做检测呢
- Of course we did. - And why was that?

801
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,950
我们整个系统都做了检测
We run tests on all our systems.

802
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,180
是常规检测
It's routine.

803
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,580
报告结果是
And the finding of that report

804
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,830
热传感器没有任何问题
is that there were no problems with the heat sensors.

805
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,160
你们是要抓着
Are you going to just ask questions

806
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,610
已经有答案的问题问下去吗
that you already know the answers to?

807
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,950
这是常规问题
It's routine.

808
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,860
传感器没有问题
There weren't any problems with the sensors.

809
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,580
-那你们是常规性地换了传感器吗  -对
- And do you routinely replace the heat sensors? - Yes.

810
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,600
我们每五年更换一次
We replace them every five years

811
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,500
那是我们定期维修的一部分
as part of our regularly scheduled maintenance.

812
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,810
那上次定期维修是什么时候呢
And when was the last regularly scheduled maintenance?

813
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,800
大约两年前
That would be two years ago.

814
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,280
你们不会修理没坏的东西  对吗
And you wouldn't fix something that wasn't broken, right?

815
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,540
当然
Of course not.

816
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,990
我做生意不是为赔钱  先生们
I'm not in the business of wasting money, gentlemen.

817
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,700
我有点疑惑
I'm a bit confused.

818
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,160
如果你做生意不是为赔钱
If you're not in the business of wasting money

819
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,980
传感器又没问题
and there was nothing wrong with those sensors,

820
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,100
那你们最近为什么要把它们全换了
then why did you just replace all of them?

821
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,690
他们没有全换
They didn't replace all of them.

822
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,930
我们希望你的客户来回答问题
I think we'd like your client to answer that question.

823
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,080
你有点为难啊  理查德
You're in a bit of a pickle, Richard.

824
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,960
你不知道说有还是没有好
You don't know whether to say you did or you didn't.

825
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,650
当然  你可以拿自己的命运摇骰子
Of course, you could roll the dice with your own life

826
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,080
就像你对待别人的生活那样
just like you did with other people's.

827
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,720
事实是  没关系
The truth is, it doesn't matter,

828
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,290
因为你已经在摄像机前说
because you already said on camera

829
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,810
你没有更换传感器
you didn't replace those sensors.

830
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,930
可我们有这个
And we have these.

831
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,310
你们从哪弄到这些的
Where'd you get these?

832
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,110
我告诉你我跟乔·亨德森说过的话
I'll tell you what I told Joe Henderson.

833
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,390
从哪弄到的不重要
It doesn't matter where they came from.

834
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,390
重要的是它们在这里
It just matters that they're here.

835
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,940
我得跟我的客户单独聊聊
I need to talk to my client.

836
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,200
好主意
That's a good idea.

837
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,690
你们得好好商量一下
You should discuss how many zeros

838
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,130
赔偿支票上得写几个零
you're gonna write on that check.

839
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,160
还有件事
And one more thing.

840
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,390
你们不只得写一张支票
You're not only gonna write a check.

841
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,580
还得写一份公开道歉信
You're gonna write a public admission

842
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,860
因为车祸里有人丧生了
because people died in that crash.

843
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,510
事情不是这么办的
That's not how this works.

844
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,980
今天它就要这么办
It's how it works today.

845
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,130
你真的要逼他们写公开道歉信吗
You're really gonna force them to make a public admission?

846
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,240
是的  当然
Damn right, I am.

847
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,880
-你是谁  圣雄甘地吗  -总得有人去逼
- Who are you, Mahatma Gandhi? - Somebody has to be.

848
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,810
你太着急赚钱了
You were too busy demanding a bunch of zeros.

849
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,230
我只是在帮你留心
Well, I was just looking out for you.

850
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,900
西装可不会自己付钱
Those suits don't pay for themselves.

851
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,860
对  是不会
No, they don't.

852
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,250
迈克  干得漂亮  你真的变强了
Mike, great job. You really stepped it up.

853
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,310
谢谢  哈维
Thanks, Harvey.

854
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,220
我觉得你也开始进入你的全盛时代了
I think you might be starting to come into your own too.

855
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,020
真的吗
Really?

856
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,960
每场比赛吗
Every single game?

857
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,580
不  只有季后赛
No, just the playoffs.

858
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,310
-两口吗  -两口
- Two sips? - Two sips.

859
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,610
-不多不少  -任何啤酒吗
- No more, no less. - Any beer?

860
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,240
不  不是任何啤酒
Oh, no, not any beer.

861
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,820
米勒淡啤
Miller Lite.

862
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,270
米勒淡啤  不是吧
Miller Lite? What?

863
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,530
但她是女王
But she's a queen.

864
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,830
能跟你说什么呢  她从她爸爸那里学来的
What can I tell you? She got it from her dad.

865
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,710
如果巨人队进入季后赛
Look, if the Giants are in the playoffs

866
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,500
杰西卡没有在他们每个初次进攻后
and Jessica doesn't take two sips of Miller Lite

867
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,610
喝两口米勒淡啤的话
after every single first down,

868
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,670
她就是觉得他们要输了
she thinks they're gonna lose,

869
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,110
完全没办法改变她的想法
and there's no talking her out of it.

870
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,010
经常发生吗  第一次进攻
And those happen a lot, right? First downs?

871
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,030
当然了
They sure do.

872
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,040
她喝醉的时候什么样子
So what is she like when she's drunk?

873
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,870
那下次再聊吧
Well, that's a conversation for another time.

874
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,940
我非常懂你了  老兄
I so feel you, bro.

875
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,630
我要说  路易
You know, I got to say, Louis,

876
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,770
我都快因为捉弄你而内疚了
I almost feel bad about pulling that prank on you.

877
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,640
别内疚
Don't feel bad.

878
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,580
那个恶作剧挺好的
It was a pretty good prank.

879
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,890
好吧
Okay.

880
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,170
再来一杯
One more?

881
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,460
除非你再跟说说杰西卡在家是什么样的
Only if you tell me more about what Jessica's like at home.

882
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,280
不  算了  我要你告诉我
No, screw that, I want you to tell me

883
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,600
皮尔逊·哈德曼时期  她是什么样的
what she was like back when it was Pearson Hardman.

884
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,530
成交
Done.

885
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,230
你要下班了吗
You're heading out for the night?

886
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,930
-再过几分钟  -想喝两杯吗
- In a few minutes. - Want to grab a drink?

887
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:19,900
庆祝一下吗
Celebrate?

888
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,620
-不行  -为什么不行
- I can't. - Why not?

889
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,960
跟你没关系
Not that it's any of your concern,

890
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,980
但我要跟伊凡·施密斯去喝酒
but I'm having drinks with Evan Smith.

891
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,050
什么  你拿到她的号码了吗
What? You got her number?

892
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,480
没有  她打电话给我了
No, she called me.

893
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,730
她问你要号码了
Oh, she asked for your number?

894
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,410
没有  也没必要  你给她的
No, she didn't have to. You gave it to her.

895
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,350
就在传票上
It was on that subpoena.

896
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,230
我知道你的传票上会写什么
I know what's gonna be on your subpoena.

897
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,340
-那是什么意思  -你知道那是什么意思
- What does that even mean? - You know what it means.

898
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,860
当然了
Sure as hell do.

899
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,690
-你想见我  -没错
- You wanted to see me? - I did.

900
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,590
我猜是因为你听说了自由铁路公司的事情了
I take it you heard about Liberty Rail.

901
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,040
-没错  -瞧瞧
- I did. - See?

902
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,040
没有伤害  没有犯规  也没有客户流失
No harm, no foul, no mass exodus of clients.

903
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,630
我很满意
I'm glad.

904
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,560
你在想什么  杰西卡  你看起来不...
What's on your mind, Jessica? You don't seem--

905
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,970
我知道你跟斯科特说过迈克·罗斯的事
I know you told Scottie about Mike Ross.

906
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,360
你怎么知道
How'd you know?

907
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,790
我也是刚刚才知道
I didn't till just now.

908
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,380
-杰西卡  -我不生气
- Jessica-- - I'm not mad.

909
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,410
我只想知道你为什么想告诉她
I just want to know what made you want to tell her.

910
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,040
那有什么区别
What difference does that make?

911
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,090
因为我也想告诉杰夫有关迈克·罗斯的事情
Because I want to tell Jeff the truth about Mike Ross too.

912
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,670
从你告诉他
What changed between now

913
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,780
有关路易假话到现在发生了什么改变吗
and when you fed him that Louis bullshit?

914
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,190
没什么改变
Nothing's changed.

915
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,750
我只是不想再对他说谎了
I just don't want to lie to him anymore.

916
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,010
他告诉你他爱你  是不是
He told you he loved you, didn't he?

917
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,100
你什么时候开始懂这些事情了
When the hell did you start figuring shit like that out?

918
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,190
我也是刚刚才懂的
I didn't till just now.

919
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,390
那就回答我的问题
Then answer my question.

920
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,280
是什么让你决定告诉斯科特的
What made you decide to tell Scottie?

921
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,180
你真正想知道的不是这些
That's not what you really want to know.

922
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,250
你想知道的是我是否后悔没有早点告诉她
What you want to know is if I wish I told her sooner.

923
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,310
你有吗
Do you?

924
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,550
对  我有
Yes, I do.

925
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,380
瑞秋  需要帮忙吗
Hey, Rachel, what can I do for you?

926
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,730
我只是想过来说声谢谢
I just wanted to come by and say thank you.

927
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,190
-谢什么  -拜托  唐娜
- For what? - Oh, come on, Donna.

928
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,430
迈克告诉我今天你救了他
Mike told me you saved the day.

929
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,990
好吧  你知道
Oh, well, you know,

930
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,930
我从那座着火的楼里救出那些孩子后
after I saved those kids from that burning building,

931
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,810
就有点多余的时间  所以
I had a little extra time, so--

932
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,600
那么今晚你也许该休息会儿了
Well, then maybe you should take the rest of the night off.

933
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,620
为什么
And why is that?

934
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,850
因为超级英雄都这样
Because that's what superheroes do.

935
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,490
18年麦卡伦
Macallan 18.

936
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,420
你很有品位
You got great taste.

937
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,210
我打电话给你很吃惊吗
Surprised I called?

938
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,820
还是那句  你很有品味  但我要说清楚
Like I said, you got great taste, but let me be clear.

939
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,090
如果你要谈和解
You want to talk settlement,

940
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,920
迈克·罗斯不在  我是不会谈的
I can't do it without Mike Ross.

941
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,220
我决不是来谈和解的
I'm definitely not here to talk settlement.

942
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,550
很好  因为有些事没有他我也能做
Good, because there are things I can do without him,

943
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,530
而且做得特别好
exceptionally.

944
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,740
我想给你看段小视频
I want to show you a little video.

945
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,950
什么  你挖到了我高中时
What, did you dig up footage

946
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,280
打锦标赛的视频了吗
from my high school championship?

947
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,130
因为那样我简直唾手可得了
Because that'll make this too easy.

948
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,190
恐怕不是
Afraid not.

949
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,510
那是你的秘书非法获取证据
That's your secretary unlawfully gathering evidence,

950
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:34,200
意味着我们根本不会达成和解
which means there will be no settlement of any kind.

951
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,170
明天  我就把这段视频发给地检
And tomorrow, I'm sending this to the district attorney.

952
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,150
好好喝吧  帅哥
Enjoy your drink, handsome.

953
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,310
杰西卡
Jessica.

954
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,140
杰夫  有件事我要告诉你
Jeff, there's something I need to tell you.

955
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,970
我也有件事要告诉你
There's something I need to tell you too.

956
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,970
怎么了
What's going on?

957
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,380
我刚刚跟路易喝了些酒
What's going on is I just had drinks with Louis,

958
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,930
为了帮你
you know, as a favor to you.

959
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,680
结果证明他不胜酒力
Turns out he's not so great at holding his liquor.

960
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,270
-他干了什么  -不  他什么也没干
- What did he do? - No, he didn't do anything.

961
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,210
-是你干的  -我不...
- You did. - I don't--

962
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,370
我们正在增进感情时
You see, we were actually bonding

963
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,150
突然想起了他对你的所作所为
when I suddenly remembered what he had done to you,

964
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,400
我想确保
and I-- well, I wanted to make sure

965
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,740
没有人会再对你做那样的事
that no one ever did that to you again.

966
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,080
所以我问他是怎么发现
So I asked him how he found out

967
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,980
丹尼尔·哈德曼挪用公款的事情的
about Daniel Hardman's embezzlement,

968
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,450
他是这样说的
and he started with the words,

969
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,360
"那是两年前"
"It was two years ago."

970
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,930
杰夫  我可以解释
Jeff, I can explain.

971
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,460
你当然可以解释
You can always explain,

972
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,600
但那意味着你所说的
but that just means your whole story

973
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:59,690
关于路易把他名字弄上墙的办法都是瞎扯的
about how Louis got his name on the door is bullshit.

974
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,310
我是来跟你说实话的
And I came here to tell you the truth.

975
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,410
又是胡扯
More bullshit!

976
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,020
那我现在告诉你
Then let me tell you now.

977
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,720
你不懂吗  那已经过去了
Don't you get it? We're past that now.

978
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,240
-我不想知道了  -杰夫
- I don't want to know! - Jeff--

979
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,490
其实  我从不想知道  我只是
In fact, I never really wanted to know, I just--

980
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,400
我只是想让你告诉我实话
I just wanted you to tell me.

981
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,140
但现在  无论你告诉我什么
But now, no matter what you tell me,

982
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,100
我都不会相信是真的
I won't ever believe it's the truth.

983
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:16,990
杰夫  让我进去
Jeff, let me in.

984
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,930
结束了  杰西卡
It's over, Jessica.

985
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,090
都完了
It's done.

986
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,730
我们结束了
We're done.
