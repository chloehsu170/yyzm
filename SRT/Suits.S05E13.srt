{\an8}{\pos(186.305,179.043)}第五季   第十三集

14
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,470
{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,740
你以为我不知道
You think that I don't know that 

16
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,140
只要我告诉他们这是哈维做的
all your problems are solved

17
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,450
你就万事大吉了
if I tell them that Harvey did this?

18
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,090
如果说我没想过迈克应该做个交易
I would be lying if I said it didn't cross my mind

19
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,140
那我一定是在说谎
that maybe Mike should think about making a deal.

20
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,610
现在他们抓走了你爸爸
And now that they've taken in your father,

21
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,060
别告诉我你没有过同样的想法
you can't tell me that the thought hasn't crossed yours too.

22
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,750
想过和说出来可不是一回事
Thinking about it and talking about it aren't the same thing.

23
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,220
我接到一个电话  是一篇关于
I got a call about an article

24
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,230
迈克・罗斯如何飞速蹿升到初级合伙人的文章
on Mike Ross' meteoric rise to junior partner.

25
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,600
问题是哈佛没有迈克・罗斯这个人
The problem is there is no Mike Ross.

26
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,460
你匿名举报了这件事
You reported it anonymously,

27
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,570
因为你不想做坏人
because you didn't want to look bad.

28
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,960
我之所以匿名举报
I reported it anonymously

29
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,230
是因为我为自己任上发生这种事而感到羞愧
because I was ashamed that it happened on my watch.

30
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,200
我那么爱你
I loved you,

31
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,450
你却让这种愚蠢的秘密成为我们之间的绊脚石
and you let some stupid secret come between us

32
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,720
只因为你无法信任我
because you couldn't trust me with it.

33
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,420
只要你承认自己犯下的错
All you have to do is admit what you did,

34
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,100
这些就会随之而去
and all of this goes away.

35
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,680
希拉站出来了
Sheila came forward.

36
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,720
她承认是她写的邮件
She admitted she was the one who wrote the e-mail.

37
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,360
你和你的合伙人被传讯
You and your partners are hereby subpoenaed

38
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,760
提供律所所有文件
to hand over every single document in the entire firm.

39
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,950
哈维  我觉得这不是个好主意
Harvey, I'm not sure this is the best idea.

40
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,260
我们得知道她手里有什么  这有什么坏处吗
We need to know what she has. What's the downside?

41
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,440
坏处就是就是我们要进入庭审了
The downside is that we move up the trial.

42
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,240
迈克  不管我们愿不愿意  庭审总会来的
Mike, this trial's coming, whether we like it or not.

43
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,750
我们越早知道她的计划
And the more time we have knowing her game plan,

44
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,100
对我们越有利
the better off we'll be.

45
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,710
-完蛋了  -怎么了
- Holy shit. - What?

46
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,000
我之前替这家伙考过法学院入学考试
I took the LASTs with this guy.

47
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,050
那又怎样
So what?

48
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,580
那他就能给吉布斯提供
So he can give Gibbs something 

49
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,810
关于我的新证据了
she doesn't even have on me yet.

50
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,460
可如果这么做  他的职业生涯就毁于一旦了
Yes, but to do that, he'd be ruining his whole career.

51
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,450
也就是说  即使他还记得你
Which means, even if he remembers you,

52
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,150
比起你怕他  他更怕你
he's more afraid of you than you are of him.

53
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,610
所以别瞎紧张了
So calm the hell down.

54
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,030
好了  我们速战速决
All right, let's make this quick.

55
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,140
法官大人  速战速决
Your Honor, making it quick is exactly

56
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,650
也是我们的请求
what we're asking you to do.

57
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,820
她还没递交她的证据
She hasn't handed over her discovery yet.

58
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,110
我还在整理案卷
I'm still building a case,

59
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,940
而且庭审日期还未确定
and we haven't even set a date for the trial yet.

60
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,830
人们不想完成任务时
And the check's in the mail, and all the other things

61
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,280
就会说正在准备之类的话
people say when they don't wanna do what they have to do.

62
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,330
我的任务是保护公众
What I have to do is protect the public 

63
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,680
免遭你这类人的毒害
from the likes of you.

64
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,780
好了  你们够了
All right, that's enough.

65
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,360
{\an8}罗尔斯法官

66
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,880
今天把证据给他们
Get that discovery to them by the end of the day.

67
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,970
既然如此  我方要求
In that case, we'd like to ask that the day of the trial

68
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,350
在两周内进行庭审
be set in the next two weeks.

69
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,610
反对  法官大人  她已经准备好几周了
Objection, Your Honor, she's had weeks to--

70
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,640
鱼与熊掌不可兼得  斯佩克特先生
You can't have it both ways, Mr. Specter.

71
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,230
你不能既想要证据又想要更多时间准备
You can't demand discovery and ask for more time.

72
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,990
庭审在两周后开始
Trial starts in two weeks.

73
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,270
杰西卡  我们有个问题
Jessica, we have a problem.

74
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,590
谢谢你能指出来  杰克
Thanks for pointing that out, Jack.

75
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,600
我都没发现呢
I had no idea.

76
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,960
我指的不是庭审
I'm not talking about the trial.

77
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,440
是这个
I'm talking about this.

78
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,100
那是什么玩意儿
What the hell is that?

79
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,020
《华尔街日报》的一篇评论文章
An op-ed in the Journal.

80
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,870
"在圣光普照的大地上绝不可能发生的事
"There is no way on God's green earth

81
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,260
就是皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所的
"that at least one of the three name partners

82
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,640
三个冠名合伙人中
"at Pearson Specter Litt

83
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,340
没有一个知道自己公司内部的勾当"
didn't know what was going on under their own roof."

84
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,560
"圣光普照的大地"  这是谁写的
"God's green earth." Who wrote it?

85
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,650
斯凯登律所的一个合伙人
A partner at Skaaden.

86
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,150
就算他们不写  也会有别人写
If it wasn't them, it would've been someone else,

87
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,260
因为他们闻到了血腥味
because they smell blood.

88
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,670
我才不管他们闻到了什么
I don't care what they smell.

89
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,520
为了这个律所我放弃了一切
I've given up everything for this firm,

90
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,220
如果任何人想从我手中夺走它
and if anybody tries to take it from me,

91
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,140
他们得从我僵硬冰冷的死尸手中掰下来才行
they'll have to pry it from my cold, dead hands.

92
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,470
-那你的计划呢  -你说什么
- And what's your goddamn plan? - Excuse me?

93
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,420
杰西卡  律所的名声正受到质疑
Jessica, our reputation's taking a beating.

94
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,770
我们需要恢复它
We need to rehabilitate it.

95
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,880
也就是要做法律援助  你懂的
That means pro bono, and you know it.

96
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,870
不管一个无偿案件多么有价值
One free case is not going to move the needle,

97
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,210
它都不会改变现状
no matter how worthy it is.

98
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,700
我指的不是单个案件
I'm not talking about one case.

99
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,380
我指的是为我们的客户最在意的慈善机构
I'm talking about a series of cases

100
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,760
提供一系列无偿服务
for our clients' most valued charities.

101
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,350
这最好不是你的新阴谋  杰克
Oh, this better not be another scheme, Jack.

102
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,390
你觉得这是我的一步阴谋
You think this is a move?

103
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,230
不然你认为我会怎么想
Now why would I ever think that after you tried

104
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,900
你刚想方设法从我手中夺权没多久呢
to take my firm from me six times in the last ten minutes?

105
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,470
我确实想夺权上位
I did try to take over from you.

106
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,290
但我这辈子都效力于这个律所
But I've been at this firm my entire career,

107
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,840
而现在我在为它抗争
and I am fighting for it now.

108
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,650
-你认为我没有为它抗争吗  -我确定你有
- And you think I'm not? - I'm sure you are.

109
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,740
但我之所以会拿着这份对律所的控告
But you're also the reason I'm holding this indictment

110
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,080
你也是首要原因
of our firm in the first place,

111
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,800
因为这上面说的很对
because what they're saying is true.

112
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,980
你敢告诉我
And don't you dare try to tell me

113
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,560
你不知道迈克・罗斯的事吗
you didn't know about Mike Ross,

114
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,060
你我都清楚你一直都知道的
because we both know you did.

115
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,190
你到底想干什么
What the hell do you want?

116
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,070
既然你都让我大老远跑来一趟了
Oh, since you made me come all the way down here,

117
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,750
我觉得我就不雇专人了
I thought I'd save the taxpayers some money 

118
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,090
好给纳税人省点钱
on hiring a server.

119
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,990
雇专人干什么
A server for what?

120
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,380
请你未婚妻  我想问她几个问题
For your fiancée. I'd like to ask her some questions.

121
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,130
哪儿凉快哪儿待着去
Get the hell out of here.

122
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,300
想送传票  你自己给她
You want to serve a subpoena, you serve it to her.

123
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,400
那样的话  我就看不到你现在的表情了
Well, then I wouldn't get to see the look on your face.

124
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,460
你真以为我不知道你的要害吗
Did you really think I wouldn't hit you where it hurts?

125
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,610
我只是把最弱的那点留到最后而已
I was saving your weakest spot for last.

126
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,880
祝你们愉快  先生们
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

127
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,510
怎么了
What? 

128
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,310
知道吗
You know what.

129
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,920
该给那个女人点颜色看看了
It's time we give that woman a taste of her own medicine.

130
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,940
你什么意思
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

131
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,790
我们雇一个外所律师
It means we hire a lawyer from an outside firm,

132
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,850
查查她关心的事情
and we dig up dirt on someone she cares about.

133
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,910
-你疯了吧  -你看到她是怎么对唐娜的了
- Are you out of your mind? - You saw what she did to Donna.

134
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,490
她用同样卑鄙的手段对瑞秋
It's only a matter of time before she tries

135
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,230
-只是时间的问题  -迈克
- to pull the same shit with Rachel. - Mike--

136
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,550
哈维  是你教的我
Harvey, you're the one that taught me that 

137
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,850
当有人向你施压时  要以牙还牙
when someone puts pressure on you, you put it back on them.

138
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,110
我还教过你  如果想要反击
I also taught you if you're gonna take a swing at someone,

139
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,520
你最好能一击制胜
you better knock them out,

140
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,000
如果我们照你说的做  
and if we pull the shit that you're talking about 

141
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,440
然后被抓了
and get caught,

142
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,250
最终下场就是我被踢出这个案子
all that happens is I get thrown off this case,

143
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,520
然后一切玩完了
and it's game over.

144
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,130
哈维  我不能眼睁睁地看着
Harvey, I can't stand by and watch while the people

145
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,230
我在乎的人受到攻击  你也不能
I care about get attacked, and neither could you.

146
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,410
迈克  我向你保证
Mike, I promise you,

147
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,690
无论如何我都会为瑞秋挺身而出
I will be there for Rachel every step of the way.

148
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,750
与此同时
In the meantime,

149
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,470
我需要你好好过一遍那些箱子里的文件
I need you going through every one of those boxes.

150
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,500
因为如果那个女人真准备好了上庭
Because if that woman is ready to go to trial,

151
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,110
那她掌握到的证据就肯定不止
she's got a lot more than an e-mail

152
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,690
路易女友的一封邮件
from Louis' girlfriend.

153
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,750
{\an8}诉讼双雄
第五季第十三集

154
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,640
-瑞秋・赞恩  -是我
- Rachel Zane. - Yes?

155
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,070
安妮塔・吉布斯  我是
My name is Anita Gibbs. I'm the--

156
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,390
我知道你是谁
Yes, I know who you are.

157
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,780
你亲自来找我  真是荣幸
I'm flattered you came for me personally.

158
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,580
但我们这三天不能见面
But we aren't supposed to talk for another three days,

159
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,370
现在我律师也不在  所以
and I don't have my lawyer with me, so--

160
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,040
这并非正式询问
This isn't a formal interrogation.

161
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,300
没必要律师陪同
That won't be necessary.

162
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,350
那我告诉你什么有必要
Then I'll tell you what is necessary.

163
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,440
你得白纸黑字的写一份证明表示我所说的
You're going to put in writing that anything I say to you

164
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,750
任何话都无效
is inadmissible.

165
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,240
我就知道你会这么说  所以准备了这个
I suspected you'd say that, which is why i prepared this.

166
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,790
如果你想向一个真从法律学校毕业的人咨询
I understand if you'd prefer to ask somebody who's actually

167
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,930
这份文件是否具有法律效力  我可以理解
completed law school if that's legally binding.

168
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,550
我完全有能力判断
I'm perfectly capable of determining

169
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,600
这是否有法律效力
if this is legally binding or not.

170
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,250
而且我也绝不会让你
And I'm not going to let you

171
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,850
骗我跟你讲任何事
bait me into saying anything to you.

172
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,890
我不介意
Well, that's fine with me.

173
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,410
我不是指望你说什么
I'm not looking for you to talk.

174
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,580
是希望你听听我的话
I'm looking for you to listen.

175
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,790
正式通知
Well, it's official.

176
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,850
不管案子结果如何
No matter what happens at trial,

177
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,770
律所也不会比迈克・罗斯活得久了
this firm isn't surviving Mike Ross.

178
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,590
我知道那篇社论了  路易
I know about the editorial, Louis.

179
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,420
什么社论
What editorial?

180
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,680
我说的是夏季新律师申请的事
I'm talking about the summer associate applications.

181
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,590
-有多可怕  -就三个人
- How bad is it? - Three people.

182
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,990
还不是随便三个人  是三个
Not just any three people, the three people 

183
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,120
根本就不配进哈佛的人
that never should've made it to harvard in the first place.

184
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,350
该死的
Goddamn it.

185
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,490
希拉是把垫底的送来了
Sheila's sending us the bottom of the barrel.

186
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,400
她是把给垫底的垫底的人
She's giving us the sludge that grows

187
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,690
送来了
at the bottom of the barrel. 

188
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,040
那么
Then...

189
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,410
我认为也许我们该把眼光放在哈佛以外了
I think it might be time to start looking beyond Harvard.

190
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,070
是吗  真是好主意  那不如
Yeah, that's a great idea. You know what?

191
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,920
我们以后有什么就招什么吧
We should start shitting in the urinals while we're at it.

192
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,490
我又没说是亚利桑那州立大学  路易
I'm not talking about the University of Arizona, Louis.

193
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,050
我指的是哥伦比亚  耶鲁  斯坦福
I'm talking about Columbia, Yale, Stanford--

194
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,420
我指的是我们的形象
And I'm talking about appearances.

195
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,990
我们打破规矩突然从哈佛以外招人的话
We break our rule and suddenly hire outside of Harvard--

196
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,560
我们收了哥伦比亚的瑞秋就已经破了规矩
We already broke our rule for Rachel with Columbia.

197
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,140
拜托  这是两码事  你自己也知道
Please, that was different, and you know it.

198
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,910
不  那就是因为迈克
No. It was because of Mike,

199
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,140
所以这才根本就是一码事
which makes it the same goddamn thing.

200
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,400
不管怎样  我们都要让律所运转下去
One way or another, we are going to keep this firm going.

201
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,580
所以你要不想去哈佛以外招人
So if you don't wanna go outside of harvard to do that,

202
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,290
那我建议你赶紧去剑桥
then I suggest you go up to Cambridge,

203
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,190
说服希拉给我们介绍些
and convince Sheila to start feeding us

204
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,060
有资格的申请者
some worthy goddamn applicants.

205
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,080
好了  你先是派车来接我
Okay. So first you pick me up,

206
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,250
又带我来了我最喜欢的咖啡店
then you bring me to my favorite café.

207
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,000
有什么办法  我的调查工作就是做得好
What can I say? I do my homework.

208
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,950
我也不赖  吉布斯女士  所以我不会
As do I, Ms. Gibbs, which is why I'm not falling for you 

209
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,250
上你假装示好的当的
pretending to be my friend.

210
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,480
你说得对  我不是你的朋友
You're right. I'm not your friend.

211
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,940
但我愿意动用点影响力
But I am willing to pull some strings

212
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,220
帮你爱的男人进哥伦比亚法学院
to get the man you love into Columbia Law School.

213
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,430
如果你以为我会相信你这个童话
And if you think that I'm gonna buy that fairy tale,

214
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,160
那你的影响力作用的唯一一个人就是我
the only strings you're trying to pull are mine.

215
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,410
这件事里唯一的童话是你以为
The only fairy tale here is the one where you believe

216
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,670
你能毫发无损的度过这一劫
you get out of this thing unscathed.

217
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,620
行了  我跟你谈够了
Okay. We're done here.

218
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,140
瑞秋  我只是想让你清楚你都有哪些路
Rachel, I'm just trying to give you your options.

219
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,080
我知道我的路
I know my options.

220
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,810
那你就该知道你没有配偶特权
Then you know you have no spousal privilege,

221
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,320
也就是说你有义务说出真相
which means you're going to have to tell the truth,

222
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,950
让你未婚夫进监狱
and put your fiancée away.

223
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,840
否则你只能引用第五修正案
Or you're gonna have to plead the Fifth.

224
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,200
或者我可以说他就没干这件事
Or I can say that he didn't do this.

225
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,400
做伪证和引用第五修正案没区别
Perjuring yourself is the same as taking the Fifth,

226
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,610
你的未来一样是毁了
as far as your future is concerned.

227
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,630
你这是什么意思
What the hell does that mean?

228
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,810
我的意思是你总有一天
I'm saying that someday you're going to face

229
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,630
要面对律界的性格健康委员会
the character and fitness committee of the bar,

230
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,450
我真的很怀疑他们会认可
and I seriously doubt they're going to admit somebody

231
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,140
干过这种事的人
who did that.

232
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,730
你是在恐吓证人吗
Are you trying to intimidate a witness?

233
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,420
没错  有天我会面对委员会的审查
Because yes, someday I will face that committee,

234
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,450
但明天他们得先听听你的事
but tomorrow they're going to be hearing about you.

235
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,090
我是你度过此劫的唯一活路
I'm your only way out of this mess.

236
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,840
把真正该付责任的人交给我
Just give me the people who are actually responsible for it,

237
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,740
我会确保你和迈克的余生都能继续
and I'll see to it that both you and Mike can practice law

238
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,390
在法律界谋生
for the rest of your lives.

239
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,490
求你告诉我这是最后一箱了
Please tell me that's the last one.

240
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,500
没错
It is.

241
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,270
除了另一间会议室堆的一百个之外
Except for the hundred in the other conference room.

242
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,880
-天哪  -是啊
- Holy shit. - Yeah.

243
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,920
庭审策略第一招
Trial strategy 101.

244
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,270
把对方埋进资料堆
Bury the other side in paperwork,

245
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,160
这样他们就不知道自己在找什么了
so they can't find what they're looking for.

246
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,450
那我们在找什么
And what are we looking for?

247
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,900
吉布斯的庭审策略
Gibbs' trial strategy.

248
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,970
这些盒子里藏着
Somewhere in these boxes are the pieces

249
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,190
她拼起来立案的拼图碎片
that she is putting together to make her case.

250
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,800
找到它们  就能确切知道我们要对付什么了
We find them, we know specifically what we have to fight.

251
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,520
那些碎片确切可能长什么样
And what specifically might those things look like?

252
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,340
证人名单  面谈  关于罗拉・詹森的一切
Witness lists, interviews, anything to do with Lola Jensen,

253
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,500
我本该在哈佛时期间的对账单
utility bills from when I was supposed to be at Harvard--

254
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,870
等等  慢点
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.

255
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,550
-你抄着些干什么  -免得忘了
- Why are you writing this down? - So I can remember it.

256
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,880
而且我们也需要建立个系统
And because we need a system.

257
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,240
而且还因为你从没做过文献整理
And because you've never done doc review before.

258
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,780
难以置信
I don't believe it.

259
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,250
你是怎么做到做了这么久的法律秘书
How you've been a legal secretary this long,

260
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,520
-还从没做过文献整理  -那我告诉你
- and never have done doc review. - I will tell you how.

261
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,590
因为我是你见过的最会读懂人心
Because I'm the best damn person you've ever seen

262
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,400
最会预测需求
at reading people, anticipating needs,

263
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,200
基本上能处理所有事的人
and generally dominating everything.

264
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,190
也就是说这件事上
So, in this situation,

265
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,700
你完全帮不上忙
you're going to be absolutely no help at all.

266
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,760
-毫无办法  -我去找瑞秋
- None whatsoever. - I'm getting Rachel.

267
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,300
那是什么
What's that?

268
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,950
你看像什么
What does it look like?

269
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,770
像我没时间处理的东西
It looks like something I don't have time for.

270
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,910
那就挤点时间出来
Well, make time.

271
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,980
杰西卡  我们有一千箱垃圾要过一遍
Jessica, we've got a thousand boxes of shit to go through,

272
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,040
-而且开庭就剩两周了  -什么
- and I've got trial in two weeks. - What?

273
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,270
没错  时间已经定了
That's right. The date's been set.

274
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,330
所以抱歉我现在没法陪你吃甜甜圈
So I'm sorry that I can't have a doughnut with you right now,

275
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,310
但我现在有稍比那重要点的事要做
but I've got something a little more important to deal with.

276
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,820
哈维  我理解  但我们客户被盯上了
Harvey, I understand, but our clients are being circled.

277
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,920
我们的名誉在受损
Our reputation's getting tanked,

278
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,830
新律师应聘人也都差得不行
and we're getting sent shit associates.

279
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,450
可迈克・罗斯面临着牢狱之灾
And Mike Ross is facing prison.

280
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,450
你只负责一件事
And you're handling one thing,

281
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,500
而我要负责其它所有事
while I'm handling everything else.

282
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,400
-杰西卡  -算了  别介意  哈维
- Jessica-- - No, never mind, Harvey.

283
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,220
我明白你其实不在乎
It's clear that you really don't care

284
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,610
这家律所是否分崩离析
about keeping this firm together.

285
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,190
我为了让律所不分裂都辞职了
I resigned to keep this firm together.

286
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,030
但这好像没有奏效啊
Well, it sure doesn't seem to be working out that way,

287
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,970
不是吗
does it?

288
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,520
好的  我会让秘书在周一安排一次会面
Great, I'll have my secretary set up a meeting for monday.

289
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,450
如果那是关于你那破公益诉讼的
If that meeting's about your pro bono bullshit,

290
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,810
-取消掉  -什么
- cancel it. - What?

291
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,310
你自己说过的  杰克  
You said it yourself, Jack. 

292
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,800
其它律所已经闻到血腥味了
Other firms smell blood.

293
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,040
友善不会让鲨鱼退却
Well, you don't get a shark to back off by playing nice,

294
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,930
你得用棍棒打在他脸上让他退却
You do it by clubbing him in the face.

295
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,790
他们挖我们的客户  我们也挖他们的
They come after our clients, we go after theirs.

296
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,690
《华尔街日报》写报道的
Clients aren't the ones writing editorials

297
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,350
可不是客户  杰克
for "The Wall Street Journal", Jack.

298
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,950
你要挖个律师
You want to poach an attorney.

299
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,880
我要挖整个部门
I wanna poach a whole goddamn department.

300
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,870
这可是完全不同的一个选择啊
That is definitely another way to go.

301
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,010
这是我们仅有的选择
It's the only way to go,

302
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,540
因为如果我们没有做那些我们说没做过的事
because if we didn't do what we're saying we didn't do,

303
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,400
-我们就会这么行动  -我明白了
-this is what we do. - I get it.

304
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,630
你要告诉外界我们是清白的
You're trying to convince the world we're innocent.

305
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,270
杰克  我不关心我的敌人是否认为
Jack, I don't give a shit if my enemies think

306
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,620
我是无辜的
I'm innocent or not.

307
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,720
我只关心他们是否认为自己能击败我
I give a shit whether they think they can take me down,

308
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,570
这就是为什么我不去忙着做公益诉讼
which is why I'm not going to cower in some pro bono corner,

309
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,930
来向他们表现自己的友善
trying to convince them that I'm friendly.

310
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,550
我要主动出击
I'm going to kick some ass,

311
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,030
让他们重温我的凶猛
and remind them that I'm fierce.

312
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,730
你在这里啊  我到处找你
There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you.

313
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,870
瑞秋  我们需要你的帮助  你跑到哪里去了
Rachel, we need your help. Where have you been?

314
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,760
跟安妮塔・吉布斯在一起
With Anita Gibbs.

315
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,330
什么  你怎么能跟她会面
What? How did you let that happen?

316
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,910
她在街上守着我  拿着一份文件
Because she ambushed me on the street,

317
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,170
声明我们俩的谈话
with a document that said our conversation 

318
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,120
不会作为证据
would be inadmissible.

319
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,250
她这么做就是
And if she did that is because 

320
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,230
为了套你的话
she didn't want to talk to you,

321
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,220
她想给你下套
she wanted to get in your head.

322
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,820
迈克  我知道她打算干什么
Mike, I know what she wanted to do.

323
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,190
她怎么说的
What did she say?

324
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,100
她说她能让你上哥伦比亚大学
She said that she could get you into Columbia,

325
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,900
在这一切平息之后你可以成为一名律师
and that you could be a lawyer after all this is over.

326
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,970
瑞秋  她在撒谎
Rachel, she's lying--

327
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,140
你觉得我看不出来吗
You think I don't know that?

328
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,450
我们已经讨论过了
Well, we've already been over this.

329
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,550
只有我们背叛了哈维和杰西卡之后
The only way she is gonna help us is if we help her

330
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,890
她才会帮我们
put Harvey and Jessica away.

331
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,330
迈克  这个我知道  但是我们没有讨论过
Yes, Mike, I know that, but we didn't go over the part

332
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,070
我因为拒绝作证而无法当律师的事
where I don't get into the bar because I took the Fifth.

333
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,940
我的天哪
Oh, goddamn it!

334
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,790
这就是为什么我希望哈维在场
This is exactly why I wanted Harvey to be there.

335
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,430
-她果然套住你了  -她没有影响到我
- She got into your head. - She didn't got into my head.

336
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,970
她把我们的梦想吊在那里诱惑我
She dangled our dream in front of me,

337
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,400
我知道这个我们不能拿
and I know that we can't have that.

338
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,260
但这并不意味着我不能掌控局面
It doesn't mean I can't handle this.

339
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,190
看情形你好像并没有掌控局面
It doesn't seem like you're handling it.

340
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,610
-我有掌控  -你哭了
- I am. - You're crying.

341
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,260
不  我释放我的情绪是因为我承认它的存在
No. I'm releasing my emotions so that I can persevere

342
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,680
而不是否认它进而失去理智
instead of denying them and losing my mind.

343
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,130
我今天不能失去理智
Which I can't do today,

344
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,040
因为我跟院长有个会面
because I have a meeting with the Dean.

345
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,770
我独自藏在这里
Now, I came in here to be alone

346
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,150
是为了处理这些烂事
so I can deal with my shit,

347
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,750
所以你不介意的话  让我一个人待会儿
so if you don't mind, I would like to be alone

348
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,350
让我自己处理这些
so I can deal with my shit.

349
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,030
你搜寻到什么结果了没有
Hey, did you find something in the discovery?

350
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,040
当然有
Yeah, sure as hell did.

351
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,340
我发现吉布斯跟瑞秋见面了
I just discovered that Gibbs picked up Rachel.

352
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,790
什么  吉布斯逮捕她了吗
What? She arrested her?

353
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,610
没有  她拿份破文件在路边等着她
No, she pulled up to the curb with some document.

354
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,290
我不关心她拿了什么狗屁文件
I don't give a shit what she pulled up with.

355
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,660
瑞秋应该明白不要跟她接触
Rachel should know not to go with her.

356
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,800
是啊  她的律师应该告知她这个
Yeah, and that would've been an excellent thing

357
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,070
可她的律师不在场
for her lawyer to tell her, except her lawyer wasn't there.

358
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,440
-什么  -你向我保证过
- Excuse me? - You promised me

359
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,350
法律程序的每一步都会陪着她
that you would be with her every step of the way.

360
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,490
我保证过我在取证的时候会跟她在一起
I promised I'd represent her at a deposition,

361
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,190
不是全天24小时做她的保姆
not babysit her 24 hours a day.

362
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,600
也许与其生瑞秋的气
Maybe instead of getting mad at Rachel,

363
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,270
我们应该想想怎么对付吉布斯
it is time for us to figure out how to go after Gibbs.【轴】

364
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,700
-又来这个  -对  又是这个
- This again. - Yes, this again.

365
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,480
我跟你说过她会找上瑞秋的  现在她找上了
I told you she was gonna go after Rachel, and now she has.

366
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,260
我也告诉过你如果你打算对付谁
And I told you if you're gonna go after someone,

367
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,380
你最好直接把他踢出局
you better knock them out.

368
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,690
那你最好找到一个把吉布斯踢出局的方法
Then you better figure out a way to knock Gibbs out soon,

369
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,660
因为如果你不做  我去做
because if you don't, I will.

370
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,210
路易
Louis.

371
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,370
-你在这里干什么  -怎么了
- What are you doing here? - What?

372
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,060
你觉得你可以当着我的面撒谎然后就完了
You thought you could lie to my face and get away with it?

373
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,400
-我从来没有对你撒谎  -真的吗
- I never lied to you. - Really?

374
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,410
因为你发誓你不会
Because you swore 

375
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,430
站出来承认那封邮件
you wouldn't come forward about that e-mail,

376
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,290
但是你食言了
but you did.

377
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,050
现在你又给我这么几个新人提名
And you you're pulling this associate shit.

378
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,880
我没有主动站出来  是他们找到我的
I didn't come forward. They found me.

379
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,590
而且新人的事也不是我搞的
And I'm not pulling any associate shit.

380
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,810
那你怎么解释这份
Then what do you call this pathetic excuse 

381
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,580
悲催的候选人名单
of a candidates list?

382
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,630
我觉得这是自然而然的
I call it inevitable.

383
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,460
因为我们的学生识字
Because our students can read.

384
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,210
-那篇报道  -是的
- The editorial. - Yes.

385
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
那篇报道
The editorial.

386
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,180
所以不是你把那些渣子给我们
So you're not sending us sludge.

387
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,490
路易  我没有做什么
Louis, I'm not doing anything.

388
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,180
你们律所正在被
Your firm is being investigated 

389
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,510
联邦检察官办公室调查
by the U.S. Attorney's office.

390
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,290
没有人会把自己的职业生涯搭进一个
And no one is going to risk their career on a place

391
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,260
不到一个月就要倒闭的地方
that may not even exist in a month.

392
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,570
他们会的  如果你去说服他们
They might, if you convince them to.

393
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,130
-路易  我不能那么做  -希拉  求求你
- Louis, I can't do that. - Sheila, please.

394
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,390
我之前来过一次  恳求得到第二次机会
I came here once before, hoping for a second chance

395
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,450
你并没有给我
and you wouldn't give it to me.

396
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,760
那跟这事有什么关系
What does that have to do with this?

397
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,210
因为如果当时我们在一起了
Because if we'd gotten back together then,

398
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,140
我就不会在这家律所了  但我还在那里
I wouldn't even be at the firm now, but I am.

399
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,680
那是我的所有了
And it's all I have.

400
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,820
我能理解你不给我第二次机会
I understand you not giving me a second chance then.

401
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,200
但现在我再次恳求你
But I'm begging you...

402
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,040
给我的律所一次机会
Give my firm one now.

403
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,470
路易  就算我愿意帮你也没用
Louis, even if I wanted to, it won't work.

404
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,840
-你怎么知道没用  -我就是知道
- You don't know that. - Yes, I do.

405
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,150
因为他们会问我去皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特工作
Because they're going to ask me if I think it's a good idea

406
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,500
是否明智  而我知道答案是否定的
For them to work at Pearson Specter Litt, and I don't.

407
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,850
-希拉  -路易
- Sheila-- - Louis.

408
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,960
请不要让我对他们撒谎
Please don't ask me to lie to them.

409
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,280
你要干嘛
What are you doing?

410
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,990
我想着你你是不是要在这里待一整天
I'm just wondering if you're gonna stay in here

411
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,330
一直看这些材料
going over stuff all day.

412
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,330
那我还能干什么  去看球赛吗
What else would I be doing? Going to the ball game?

413
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,110
我不清楚啊  哈维
I don't know, Harvey,

414
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,370
我以为你会在想办法让安妮塔・吉布斯
I thought maybe you'd be doing something to get Anita Gibbs

415
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,390
放过瑞秋
to back off Rachel.

416
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,110
唐娜  她威胁说要去找律师协会
Donna, she threatened to go to the bar.

417
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,950
那简直是胡扯  没有瑞秋的证词
It's a bullshit hypothetical that she couldn't do

418
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,550
她是不能这么做的
until after Rachel testified.

419
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,300
瑞秋的证词得在庭审后才有
Which is after the trial starts,

420
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,780
这才是我现在正准备的事情
and that's what I'm goddamn working on.

421
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,950
哈维  我只是想说
Harvey, all I'm saying is

422
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,890
迈克为事情着急的时候
that when Mike gets worked up about something,

423
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,530
不一定能做出最好的决定
he doesn't tend to make the best decisions.

424
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,210
如果他不为调查证据做准备的话
Well, if he doesn't work on the discovery,

425
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,650
他就要去蹲监狱了  所以
he's gonna go to jail, so...

426
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,330
-你让我怎么办  -我不知道  哈维
- What do you want me to do? - I don't know, Harvey.

427
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,650
但你至少得去找安妮塔・吉布斯谈谈
But you better at least go talk to Anita Gibbs,

428
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,660
因为迈克已经明确告诉过你了
because Mike gave you a warning loud and clear.

429
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,040
如果你不行动的话  他来
If you don't do something, he will.

430
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,200
杰克  我一般不出来喝咖啡
Jack, I don't often come outside for my coffee,

431
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,560
但是我出来了就说明我觉得我有需要
but when I do is because I'm feeling the need

432
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,970
一个人静静
for a little alone time.

433
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,420
我出来是因为我知道你不想让
Well, I came out here because I knew you wouldn't want

434
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,820
任何人听到我接下来要说的话
anyone hearing what I have to say.

435
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,860
你是来告诉我你能搞定的吗
Are you here to tell me you can get the job done?

436
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,520
不  我来是告诉你如果你想让我把事情搞定的话
No, I'm here to tell you if you want me to get it done,

437
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,610
那就要破费了
you're going to have to open your wallet.

438
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,680
我不会多付你钱
I'm not paying you more money,

439
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,420
就为了让你挖个墙脚
just to get you to poach a department.

440
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,690
我说的不是我
I'm not talking about me.

441
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,980
我说的是贝克・豪斯特勒律所的房地产部门
I'm talking the Real Estate Division of Baker Hostetler.

442
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,380
-他们想要多少  -现在的两倍
- How much do they want? - Double what they're making.

443
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,900
你疯了吗
Are you insane? 

444
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,940
杜威・巴兰坦就是这么被拖垮的
That's what broke Dewey Ballantine.

445
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,810
你不能同时有两班合伙人
You can't have two classes of partners.

446
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,320
那我们就不能挖部门了
Then we can't poach a department,

447
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,370
因为考虑到目前的状况
because they're the only ones even willing to come here,

448
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,090
他们是唯一愿意来的
considering what's going on.

449
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,060
那就开条件吧
Then make the offer.

450
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,020
让我安安静静地喝完我的咖啡
And let me have my goddamn coffee in peace.

451
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,320
斯科特女士
Ms. Scott,

452
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,870
有位哈维・斯佩克特先生找你
there's a Harvey Specter here to see you.

453
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,200
他说有急事
He says it's urgent.

454
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,540
让他进来
Send him in.

455
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,210
难以置信
I don't believe it.

456
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,470
为了进来说自己是哈维  你胆子还真不小啊
You have some balls pretending to be Harvey to get in here.

457
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,230
你是叫过我"小哈维"来着
Well, you did call me "Baby Harvey" once.

458
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,860
我才不管以前叫过你什么
I don't give a shit what I called you.

459
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,680
-出去  马上  -斯科特  斯科特  求你
- Get out! Now! - Scottie, Scottie, please.

460
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,250
听着  我知道你肯定不会见我的
Listen, I knew you would never agree to see me,

461
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,340
但我得跟你谈谈
and I need to talk to you.

462
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,720
谈什么
About what?

463
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,980
我需要有人来对付
I need someone to bring an action

464
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,280
-安妮塔・吉布斯的妹妹  -你疯了吗
- against Anita Gibbs' sister. - Are you insane?

465
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,060
听我说  她不光是冲着我来的
Listen to me. She's not just coming after me.

466
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,810
-现在连我的未婚妻也不放过  -我不在乎
- She's coming after my fiancée. - I don't care.

467
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,940
如果我真帮了你  还不如给那女人打个电话
If I do that, I might as well call the woman up,

468
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,100
直接告诉她你那一通狗屁里有我一份功劳
and tell her that I'm in on your whole bullshit too.

469
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,340
-那就从你的律所里挑个人  -更不用说
- We get someone from your firm-- - Not to mention 

470
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,760
我跟哈维说了
I told Harvey that I never

471
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,950
我连你的名字都不想再听到
even wanted to hear your name again.

472
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,330
他没告诉你  是吧
He didn't tell you about that, did he?

473
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,170
那我猜他也没变
Well, I guess he hasn't changed,

474
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,470
因为他也没有告诉我你的事
because he didn't tell me about you

475
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,200
直到一切都为时已晚
until it was too late either.

476
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,930
所以你未婚妻的事我很遗憾
So I am sorry about your fiancée,

477
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,420
但现在请你出去
but I need you to go now.

478
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,110
斯科特  这女人不得到她想要的东西
Scottie, this woman is not gonna stop

479
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,640
是不会停的
until she gets what she wants.

480
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,060
而她想要的  正是哈维
And what she wants is Harvey.

481
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,420
所以我不是求你为了我和瑞秋
So I'm not asking you to do this for me and Rachel.

482
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,250
而是求你为了他
I'm asking you to do it for him.

483
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,260
你成人礼的请柬吗
Is that an invitation to your bar mitzvah?

484
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,660
我那天可没空
Because I'm busy that day.

485
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,220
是一封因你不正当接触证人
It's a motion to have you sanctioned

486
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,800
而对你申请制裁的动议
for improperly contacting a witness.

487
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,520
我可没有非正当联系任何人
I didn't improperly contact anyone.

488
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,300
胡说
Oh, bullshit.

489
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,880
你和瑞秋・赞恩单独见面
You got Rachel Zane alone so you could 

490
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,570
就是为了劝她告发我
offer her a deal to turn on me.

491
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,950
可那并没有什么不对啊
And there's nothing wrong with that.

492
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,980
你听我说
You listen to me.

493
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,390
这件事一开始你就一直在
You've been pulling shit like this

494
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,170
像这样搞小动作
from the second this thing started.

495
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,180
先是不让我的客户见他的律师
You denied my client access to his attorney,

496
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,960
然后又针对唐娜进行虚假指控
you fabricated charges against Donna,

497
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,700
现在又来干扰证人
and now you're tampering with a witness.

498
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,030
干扰证人对我的案子有百害而无一利
And all witness tampering would do is hurt my own case,

499
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,320
圣光普照  我究竟为什么要这么做
and why on god's green earth would I do that?

500
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,580
你刚说什么
Why did you just say?

501
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,240
我说你真是疯了才会觉得
I said you're insane if you think that--

502
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,040
不是  你刚说"圣光普照"
No, you said, "On god's green earth,"

503
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,450
跟那篇文章里用词一模一样
which is exactly what that editorial said.

504
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,490
我记得是因为我当时还想
I remember because I thought,

505
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,030
"哪个80岁以下的人用这种词啊"
"What person under 80 uses that phrase?"

506
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,340
看来我找到她了
Well, looks like I found her.

507
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,540
我不知道你在说些什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

508
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,190
你当然知道  因为整件事都是你一手策划的
You sure as hell do, because you planted that goddamn thing.

509
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,490
有证据吗
You have any proof? 

510
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,330
你没有
No, you don't.

511
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,280
就算真的是我一手策划的
But even if I did plant that, 

512
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,230
那也肯定是因为
it would only have been

513
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,010
你们不可能不知道
because there's no way that one of you

514
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,190
到底发生了什么事
did not know what was going on.

515
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,940
除非你们中有人承认
And until one of you admits that,

516
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,750
不然我就会一点一点整垮你们的律所
I'm going to take apart your firm brick by brick.

517
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,780
你要是真想递交那动议  随你
So you want to file that thing? You go ahead.

518
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,040
这根本就阻止不了我
It's not going to stop me for one second.

519
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,890
{\an8}赫里克院长

520
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,650
瑞秋  请
Rachel, please.

521
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,590
-请坐  -谢谢院长
- Have a seat. - Thank you, Dean.

522
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,100
我得说我真的很期待
I have to say I've so been looking forward

523
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,640
我的第一次学生回访
to my first student review.

524
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,400
自你的第一次面试起
And ever since your first interview here,

525
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,150
你就给我留下了很深的印象
you've done nothing but impress me.

526
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,680
这也正是为什么提出这件事我非常遗憾
Which is why I'm sorry to have to bring this up now.

527
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,390
提出什么
Bring what up?

528
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,310
你这次的法学院入学考试分数比之前的
The fact that your last LSAT score was significantly higher

529
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,340
要高出很多
than your previous ones.

530
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,820
那是因为我这次
That is because I studied 

531
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,900
学习得超级努力啊
incredibly hard the last time.

532
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,050
是你努力学习
Did you study hard? 

533
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,410
还是你的未婚夫替你努力学习了
Or did your fiancée study hard for you?

534
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,280
你觉得入学考试是迈克替我考的
You think Mike took the LSAT for me?

535
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,360
我觉得他还得被控
I think he's been indicted

536
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,010
比这更严重的罪名
for more serious crimes than that.

537
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,900
况且还有指控说
And now there are allegations

538
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,360
他有过替考法学院入学考试的前科
that he's taken the LSATs for people.

539
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,480
真是难以置信  那考试是我自己考的
I can't believe this. I took that test myself.

540
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,180
但我有责任保护
And I have a responsibility to protect

541
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,100
这所大学的声誉
the reputation of this university.

542
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,680
那你要怎么做
And how exactly are you proposing

543
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,380
来保护这所谓的声誉
to protect that reputation?

544
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,520
开除任何危及本校名誉的人
By expelling any dangers to it.

545
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,220
当然了  除非  由于某些原因
Unless, of course, for some reason

546
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,530
这些针对他的指控被撤销了
these allegations against him are dropped.

547
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,160
安妮塔・吉布斯找你了  是不是
Anita Gibbs called you, didn't she?

548
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,610
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

549
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,630
我不过是出于礼貌告诉你
I'm simply giving you the courtesy of letting you know

550
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,860
假如我得在你的前程和本校的未来间做出选择
that if I have to choose between your future  and this university's,

551
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,420
我不会选你
I'm not choosing you.

552
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,070
那么拜托  告诉吉布斯女士
Well, then, please, tell Ms. Gibbs

553
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,330
谢谢她的礼貌之举
thank you for the courtesy.

554
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,530
斯科特  你在这里干什么
Scottie, what are you doing here?

555
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,380
我简直不敢相信你派他来找我
I can't believe you sent him to me.

556
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,050
-派谁  -别和我玩那套
- Sent who? - Oh, don't give me that.

557
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,140
上次你来找我
The last time you came to me,

558
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,430
你说是因为迈克让你来的
you said it was because Mike made you.

559
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,140
这一次  就是你让他来的
Well, this time, you made him.

560
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,280
我没让他干任何事
I didn't made him do anything.

561
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,140
那么你把他教得不错  因为他来找我
Well, then, you taught him well, because he came to me

562
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,110
和我玩攻心战
and pulled on my heart strings

563
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,180
以便让我帮你做事
to get me to do something for you,

564
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,200
但这一次  我拒绝
but this time the answer is no.

565
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,090
我不会去对付安妮塔・吉布斯的
I am not going after Anita Gibbs.

566
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,340
斯科特  我绝不对让你去做这种事的
Scottie, I would never ask you to do something like that.

567
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,810
那就有趣了  因为你曾让我放弃一个案子
That's funny, because you asked me to throw a case

568
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,170
以保护迈克不被抓
to keep Mike from getting caught.

569
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,390
放弃一个案子是不会让你成为靶子的
Throwing a case doesn't put a target on your back.

570
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,430
假如你真的不想让我成为靶子
If you really wanted to keep a target off my back,

571
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,730
你一开始就不会告诉我迈克的事
you never would've told me about Mike in the first place.

572
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,060
斯科特  我没让他那么做
Scottie, I didn't tell him to do that.

573
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,650
那我猜你俩之间的问题和我们当初的一样
Well, then, I guess you two are having the same problem we did.

574
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,740
你们互相不沟通
You don't talk to each other.

575
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,150
但既然你弃我选他  那这事就和我无关了
Since you chose him over me it's not my problem anymore.

576
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,880
我没有弃你选他
I didn't chose him over you.

577
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,390
不  你有
Yes, you did.

578
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,780
而且无论你承不承认
And whether you choose to admit it or not,

579
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,410
当初就是迈克的秘密害我们分手的
it was Mike's secret that broke us up in the first place.

580
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,670
你没和我说一声就让她进来了
You let her in here without telling me?

581
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,660
我当时在会议室  翻看调查证据
I was in the conference room, going over discovery.

582
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,220
你打算做什么
What are you going to do?

583
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,810
我不知道我要做什么  但无论做什么
I don't know what I'm gonna do, but whatever it is,

584
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,710
我都打算立刻动手
I'm gonna do it right now.

585
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,730
哈维  冷静点
Harvey, calm down.

586
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,740
我才不打算冷静呢
I'm not gonna calm down,

587
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,120
你让我去对付吉布斯
you told me to go after Gibbs

588
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,480
以防止迈克做出什么傻事  我去了
to stop Mike from doing something stupid, and I did,

589
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,890
但一切就像我说的  都是浪费时间
and all that did was waste our time like I said it would.

590
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,980
哈维  吉布斯在攻击瑞秋
Harvey. Gibbs is attacking Rachel, 

591
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,250
他爱的女人
the woman he loves.

592
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,380
所有人中你最应该能理解那一点
You of all people should be able to understand that.

593
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,500
我才不管
I don't give a shit.

594
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,820
他无权去找我爱的人的麻烦
He had no right to go after someone I love.

595
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,330
好吧  你知道吗  哈维
Okay, you know what, Harvey?

596
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,000
要受审的是迈克  不是斯科特
Mike is the one on trial here, not Scottie.

597
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,630
而他所做的不过是求她办些事
And all he did was ask her to do something.

598
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,650
所以也许你真正生气的是
So maybe the thing that you're really upset about

599
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,050
她说得没错
is that she was right.

600
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,630
怎么样了
Well, how did it go?

601
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,610
我们认识很久了  杰克
We've known each other a long time, Jack,

602
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,640
我也真的很想帮忙
and I'd really like to help, 

603
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,700
但我帮不了
but it's not gonna happen.

604
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,060
你说过假如我能让他们出的钱翻倍...
You said if I could get them double--

605
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,200
我说的是至少得翻倍我才好开口去问
I said it would take at least double just to get me to ask.

606
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,140
我问了  然后他们笑得让我待不下去
I did, and they laughed me out of the room.

607
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,320
假如我能搞来更多钱呢
What if I could get you more?

608
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,350
无论花多少钱都无法让他们
There's no number that's going to get them 

609
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,500
投向皮尔逊-斯佩克特
to come to Pearson Specter

610
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,700
因为他们不相信这家律所能存活下去
because they don't believe there's gonna be a firm to come to.

611
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,050
那你为何还要约我来这里见面
Then why did you ask to meet me here?

612
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,650
因为在我向他们提过你的提议之后
Because after I asked them about your offer,

613
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,770
我还问了他们我的提议
I asked them about mine.

614
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,790
什么意思
What are you talking about?

615
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,600
我告诉他们我有一个前兄弟会兄弟
I told them a former fraternity brother of mine,

616
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,990
他恰好是一名也许想另寻良机的厉害律师
who happens to be a kick-ass lawyer might be looking for a change.

617
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,100
你在给我提供一份工作吗
You're offering me a job?

618
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,730
杰克  皮尔逊-斯佩克特日是艘下沉的船
Jack, Pearson Specter's a sinking ship.

619
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,890
我们是进了些水
We've taken on some water.

620
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,250
你们那是进了一海洋的水
You've taken on an ocean.

621
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,120
你到底是为什么想留在那里
Why the hell would you wanna stay there?

622
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,290
我会告诉你为什么的
I'll tell you why.

623
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,600
因为假如那艘船沉了
Because if that ship sinks,

624
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
我会再找到一份工作
I'll find myself another job.

625
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
但假如它没沉
But if it doesn't,

626
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,010
我就有机会成为船长之一了
I have the chance to be one of the captains.

627
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,290
假如我现在就投奔你
If I come to you now,

628
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,150
我一辈子就只能干这个了
I'll never be more than a lifer.

629
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,910
作为我的朋友  告诉我我错了
As my friend, tell me I'm wrong.

630
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,720
你没错
You're not wrong.

631
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,580
别告诉我他们为我们也特别印了一份晚报
Don't tell me they printed out a special evening edition on us too.

632
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,220
还没
Not yet.

633
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,240
我读了
I read it, 

634
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,800
顺带一提
by the way,

635
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,540
在飞去波士顿的路上
on the flight up to Boston.

636
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,260
你有被那篇文章气到吗
And did it fire you up?

637
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,440
快给气死了
Pissed me the hell off.

638
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,870
你没搞定希拉  是不是
You couldn't get it done with Sheila, could you?

639
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,020
杰西卡  那张单子上的候选人不是她选的
Jessica, she didn't send us the candidates on that list.

640
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,440
而是只有他们三个提交了申请
They were the only three that even asked to be submitted,

641
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,640
就因为那张报纸上的屁话
and it was because of bullshit like that.

642
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,740
-大家都不敢来这里了  -的确
- People are scared to come here. - They are.

643
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,360
我试图说服希拉安抚他们  但我失败了
I tried to get Sheila to make them unafraid, but I couldn't.

644
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,420
没关系
That's all right.

645
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,230
没关系的  路易  这不是你的错
It's all right, Louis. It's not your fault.

646
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,030
一旦迈克的事泄露出去
Once word got out about Mike

647
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,740
这种事注定会发生
this was bound to happen.

648
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,290
从雇用迈克这件事上我学到了一点
What I learned from hiring Mike

649
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,840
那就是并非所有的好律师都上过哈佛
was that not all great lawyers went to Harvard.

650
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,580
你的意思是
What are you saying?

651
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,370
我联系了斯坦福  耶鲁
I contacted Stanford, Yale, 

652
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,040
哥伦比亚  宾大  以及其他所有...
Columbia, Penn, and all the rest...

653
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,170
前20的法学院
top 20 law schools.

654
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,970
我正式打开了皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特的大门
I officially opened up the doors to Pearson Specter Litt.

655
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,410
我知道你有多不情愿这么做  路易
I know how much you hated to do that, Louis,

656
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,990
但有时我们不得不去做一些事...
but sometimes we need to do what we have to...

657
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,380
为了生存
to survive.

658
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,210
-我还能做些别的什么吗  -没有了
- Is there anything else I can do? - No, there isn't.

659
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,690
现如今  我们只需要挺过这场庭审
Right now, we just need to get through this trial,

660
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,680
并向上帝祈祷哈维能帮
and pray to god that Harvey gets

661
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,020
迈克・熊孩子・罗斯脱罪
Mike goddamn Ross off the hook.

662
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,210
你在洗碟子
You're doing dishes.

663
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,040
所以呢
So?

664
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,760
你讨厌洗碟子
So you hate doing dishes,

665
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,940
这意味着出问题了
which means something's wrong.

666
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,170
没什么问题
Nothing's wrong.

667
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,890
发生什么事了
What's going on?

668
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,940
我都不知道自己该不该说
I don't even know if I should say it,

669
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,990
因为上次我说了之后你暴跳如雷
because the last time I did you got so mad.

670
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,330
你以为我要离开你
You thought I was gonna leave you.

671
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,910
你说你想让我向你倾诉
And you say you want me to share things with you,

672
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,190
但我不确定你是不是真心的
but I don't know if you do,

673
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,160
因为当我倾诉了
because when I do

674
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,520
你就也变得特别沮丧  让我...
you seem to get so upset that I--

675
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,060
我懂了  你想说做交易的事
I get it. You want to talk about making a deal.

676
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,080
我不知道我要做什么
I don't know what I wanna do.

677
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,420
我只是...
I just--

678
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,010
她说她能把你弄进哥伦比亚大学
She said that she could get you into Columbia,

679
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,880
而你说得很对
and you're right.

680
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,190
这话说到我心里了
It got into my head.

681
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,610
瑞秋  之前她就这么说了
Rachel, we've been over this.

682
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,010
那是在撒谎
She was lying.

683
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,450
那是在我知道她能指使院长之前
That was before I knew she was able to get to the dean.

684
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,840
你说什么
What are you talking about?

685
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,350
今天我和院长见面了
I had my meeting with him today,

686
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,640
我原本以为他要和我说
And I thought he was going to tell me

687
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,130
我做得有多好  可结果...
how well I've been doing, and instead...

688
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,390
他威胁说要开除我
He threatened to expel me.

689
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,610
好吧
Okay.

690
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,610
好吧  但这并不意味着这是吉布斯干的
Okay, that--that doesn't mean that it was Gibbs.

691
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,340
-你不在那里  -我是不在那里  好吧
- You weren't there. - No, I wasn't there, all right?

692
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,630
但没跟吉布斯沟通过得情况下
But it's not crazy to assume that they would question

693
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,230
就来问你是否认识我也是合理的事
whether or not you knew about me without talking to Gibbs.

694
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,340
那没跟吉布斯沟通过得情况下
Is it crazy for them to mention a crime

695
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,620
他们提到一项你没被指控的罪名算不算合理
you haven't even been accused of without talking to Gibbs?

696
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,850
-什么  -他们说有流言称
- What? - They said there are rumors

697
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,270
你替别人考法学院入学考试
of you taking the LSATs for people

698
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,320
他们说是你替我考试
And they're accusing you of doing that for me.

699
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,420
起码现在我知道该怎么做了
Well...At least now I know what I need to do.

700
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,020
哈维
Harvey.

701
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,000
我知道该怎么阻止吉布斯向瑞秋施压了
I know how we can stop Gibbs from pressuring Rachel.

702
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,330
包括不跟我说一声就跑到斯科特那里吗
Does it involve going to Scottie without telling me?

703
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,880
-哈维  -该死  你无权这么做
- Harvey. - Goddamn it, you had no right.

704
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,840
我当然有这个权力
I had every right, 

705
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,580
因为我知道吉布斯会不断越界
because I knew Gibss would keep crossing lines,

706
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,130
而她之前就是这么做的
and that's exactly what she did.

707
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,960
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

708
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,200
她让哥伦比亚大学的院长
She manipulated the dean of Columbia

709
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,890
威胁瑞秋说要开除她
into threatening to expel Rachel.

710
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,770
证据呢
Where's your proof?

711
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,530
他们跟她说是我替她考的法学院入学考试
They accused her of having me take the LSATs for her,

712
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,120
唯一的问题在于  没有任何记录
and the only problem is, there's no record of me

713
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,800
显示我被控那么做过
ever having being accused of that.

714
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,950
是你在法庭上见到的那个人
The guy you saw in court. 

715
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,350
没错  他叫大卫・格林
Yes, his name is David Green.

716
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,950
他肯定和吉布斯说过这事
He must've told Gibbs about me, 

717
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,790
于是她利用这点
and then she used that

718
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,670
来让院长威胁瑞秋
to get the dean to strong-arm Rachel.

719
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,950
这是在滥用权力
That's abuse of power.

720
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,030
我跟你说过  这个说法唯一的问题在于
I told you, the only problem with that theory is,

721
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,520
只要大卫・格林跟吉布斯说起这事
David Green tells Gibbs about you,

722
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,420
他的事业就完了
and his career is done.

723
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,010
那他肯定是向她匿名举报的
Then he must've told her anonymously.

724
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,570
那也帮不了我们  因为我们还是没有
Which doesn't help us, 'cause we still don't have

725
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,210
她联系过院长的证据
any proof that she contacted the dean.

726
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,910
是没有  但我要找出证据并不难
No, we don't, but it wouldn't be that hard for me to get.

727
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,570
不行  这可能是陷阱  风险太大了
No, it could be a setup. It's too risky.

728
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,390
这整件事的风险都很大
This whole goddamn thing is too risky,

729
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,550
可现在瑞秋的前途危在旦夕
but right now Rachel's future is in jeopardy,

730
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,120
为了她就算多判我几年
And if I have to risk tacking on a few years to save her,

731
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,900
都算不了什么
is not even a close call.

732
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,920
好吧  尽管去做吧
All right. Do what you have to do.

733
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,340
别被抓就行
Just don't get caught.

734
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,300
你敲门了
You're knocking.

735
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,570
这说明如果不是有坏消息就是你别有所求
That means it's either bad news or you want something.

736
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,870
-我搞不定那个部门  -我猜猜
- I couldn't get the department. - Don't tell me.

737
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,810
他们说我们已经没有能挖人的地位了
They said we're in no position to poach anybody.

738
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,890
在给我一份工作之前
That's exactly what they said,

739
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,000
他们就是这么说的
right before they offered me a job.

740
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,210
所以你是来跟我说你接受了吗
So you're here to tell me you took it.

741
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,220
我是来问你想要我接受吗
I'm here to ask you if you want me to take it.

742
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,280
我想不想能有什么区别
What the hell difference does it make what I want?

743
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,990
杰西卡  当我离开波士顿时  别人说我是叛徒
Jessica, when I left Boston, people said I was a traitor

744
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,540
说我觉得我的才华在家乡得不到施展
and that I thought I was too good for my own hometown.

745
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,050
事实并非如此
Well, it wasn't true.

746
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,620
而我明白真正的考验
But I knew the real test for me

747
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,250
并不是在家乡大展身手
wasn't making it in my own hometown.

748
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,600
而是在这座环境最艰险的城市
It was making it in the toughest city

749
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,960
开创事业  就我所知
in the world, and as far as I'm concerned,

750
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,320
我还没做到
I haven't done that yet.

751
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,000
你想成为冠名合伙人
You want to be made name partner.

752
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,890
我想知道你愿不愿意考虑
I wanna know if it'll ever even be on the table.

753
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,410
现在我就能给你肯定的答案
I could say yes to that right now,

754
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,450
可你怎么知道你能相信我
but how would you know you could trust me?

755
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,620
我别无选择
I have no other choice.

756
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,810
我又怎么知道自己能相信你
And how do I know I can trust you?

757
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,470
-这是什么  -你知道是什么
- What's this? - You know what it is.

758
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,280
这是丹尼尔・哈德曼手里关于你的把柄
It's what Daniel Hardman has on you.

759
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,520
现在你也有了
Now you have it too.

760
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,390
大卫・格林
David Green.

761
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,880
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

762
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,120
看来你确实记得我
So you do remember me.

763
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,060
当然记得
Of course I do.

764
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,680
你是我们正在起诉的人
You're the guy we're prosecuting.

765
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,250
那个冒牌律师
The fake lawyer.

766
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,100
我的能耐可不止如此  你懂的
Oh, I'm more than that and you know it.

767
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,730
什么意思
What are you talking about?

768
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,410
你当年雇我是因为我够聪明
You hired me because I'm smart.

769
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,650
可你不知道的是我有过目不忘的能力
What you don't know is that I have a photographic memory,

770
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,090
这意味着我七年前就记住了
which means I have your drivers license number

771
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,130
你的驾驶证号
from seven years ago memorized.

772
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,930
这也算不上什么  因为我有复印件了
Not that it matters, because I also made a copy.

773
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,720
我把所有客户的驾照都复印下来了
Like I made a copy of all my clients' licenses.

774
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,630
那也证明不了什么
That doesn't prove anything.

775
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,080
或许吧  可我同样记得那104个问题
Maybe not, but I also remember every answer I put down

776
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,490
我是如何作答的
on a 104 question test.

777
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,330
如果那都不算证据  世上就没证据了  
If that's not proof, I don't know what is.

778
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:34,980
你想怎样
What do you want?

779
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,340
我想要是安妮塔・吉布斯让哥伦比亚大学的院长
I want proof that Anita Gibbs' pressuring the dean of Columbia

780
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,960
开除瑞秋・赞恩的证据
to expel Rachel Zane.

781
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,820
-我没法这么做  -你可以的
- I can't do that. - Yes, you can.

782
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,420
好吧  他们在法学院是同学
Okay, they went to law school together.

783
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,510
这就是他们的联系
There's your connection.

784
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,180
公共记录这种旁证可没什么用
Circumstantial public record not good enough.

785
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,740
如果被人抓到我帮了你
I do what you're asking and get caught,

786
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,290
那我就没法呆在联邦检察官办公室
and my career at the U.S. Attorney's office is over.

787
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,620
如果我向地方检察官检举此事
I give what I have to the D.A.,

788
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,030
你就连做律师的资格都没了
and your career as a lawyer is over.

789
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,500
这样做只会连累你自己
If you do that, you only implicate yourself.

790
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,930
是啊  可能你还没注意到  混账
Yeah, maybe you didn't notice, asshole,

791
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,770
我已经被审了  如今你们却找
but I'm already on trial, and now you're coming

792
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,180
我爱的女人的麻烦
after the woman I love.

793
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,240
事实就是你不配做律师
And the truth is you don't deserve to practice law.

794
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,330
我或许也不配  但她配
Maybe I don't either, but she does.

795
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,740
相信我  当事关这件事时
And, believe me, when it comes to this,

796
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,490
我才不管你我死活
I really don't give a shit about me or you.

797
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,400
如果我找不到你想要的东西怎么办
And what if I can't find what you're looking for?

798
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,970
这么说吧  大卫
You know what, David?

799
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,060
你或许还没聪明到能在法学院入学考试拿178分
You might not have been smart enough to get 178 on the LSATs,

800
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,690
但我很确定你不会蠢到那事都干不了
but I'm pretty damn sure you're smart enough to do that.

801
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,150
-这是什么  -你要签的东西
- What's this? - That's what you're gonna sign.

802
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,300
上面写了你们要撤销一项
This says you're dropping a charge

803
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,450
对我诬告的诉讼  以交换
of malicious prosecution in exchange for

804
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,100
我承认进行了不当侵权
me admitting a sanctionable offense.

805
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,220
并且放弃传唤瑞秋・赞恩
And for backing the hell off going after Rachel Zane.

806
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,540
-这是开玩笑吗  -不
- Is this a joke? - No.

807
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,310
让哥伦比亚法学院院长来给你做脏事
And neither is getting the Dean of Columbia Law

808
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,830
也不是开玩笑的
to do your dirty work.

809
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,020
我不知道你们在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

810
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,630
你很清楚
You know exactly what we're talking about.

811
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,900
除非你想让我们告诉全世界
And unless you want us to tell the world

812
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,080
你勾结法学院老朋友
that you intimidated a witness

813
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,500
恐吓证人
by colluding with your old law school buddy,

814
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
你就得签了那个
you're going to sign that.

815
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,550
你们没有任何证据
You don't have a shred of proof

816
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,280
证明我让任何人做了任何事
that I had anyone do anything.

817
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,170
我有一份给你的匿名举报的副本
I have a copy of an anonymous tip sent to you,

818
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,680
说我代人考法学院入学考试
saying I took the LSAT for people,

819
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,590
还有一段十分钟后从你办公室打给
and a record of a phone call from your office

820
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,760
哥大院长的电话的录音
to the Dean of Columbia ten minutes later.

821
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,580
那什么也不能证明
That's no proof of anything.

822
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,440
那证据足够我们
It's proof enough for us to sue Dean Herrick

823
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,660
把赫里克院长告到陪尽所有财产了
for every penny he's ever made.

824
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,980
你觉得等我们把他送上证人席
You think when we get him in a deposition

825
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,460
他不会开口吗
he isn't gonna crack?

826
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,410
你们觉得你们很聪明是吗
You think you're pretty smart, don't you?

827
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,930
够赢个联邦检察官了
Smart enough to outwit a U.S. Attorney.

828
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,280
如果我们在这儿能赢你  你凭什么觉得
And if we can do it here, what makes you think

829
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,810
我们没法在法庭上赢呢
we won't be able to do it in court?

830
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,300
因为法庭跟这些废话无关
Because court is not about bullshit like this.

831
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,650
那里要讲事实
It's about facts.

832
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,130
事实是  你不是律师
And the fact is, you're not a goddamn lawyer.

833
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,320
你把事情解决了
You have it done.

834
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,680
-你怎么知道的  -因为你
- How'd you know? - Because you're doing

835
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,800
把胸挺得很高
that puffy chest thing you do

836
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,600
你每次自我感觉特别良好时都那样
when you feel really good about yourself.

837
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,770
我不挺胸的
I do not do a puffy chest thing.

838
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,400
你会的  别紧张
Yes, you do. And relax,

839
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,710
因为我爱你  也爱你的胸
because I love you and your chest.

840
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,890
我也爱你  和你的胸
Well, I love you and your chest.

841
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,790
那句错了
Oh, that came out wrong.

842
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,140
真的  我是想说你的头脑
Seriously, I meant your mind.

843
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,260
你聪慧的法律头脑
Your brilliant legal mind.

844
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,530
如果不是你和你聪慧的法律头脑
Well, if it wasn't for you and your brilliant legal mind,

845
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,630
我现在也不会在法学院里
I might not be in law school right now.

846
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,940
不  我理解他们很多人都已经申请...
No, I-I understand that a lot of them already--

847
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,910
好  如果有人想要
Okay, well, if anyone wants to--

848
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,280
不  我明白  我明白
No, I see. I see.

849
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,600
也许明年吧
Maybe next year.

850
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,640
再见
Bye.

851
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,120
路易
Louis.

852
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,100
我得跟你聊一聊
I need to talk to you for a second.

853
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,370
又是什么事
What now?

854
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,760
杰克・索罗夫想知道
Jack Soloff wants to know

855
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,490
我们会不会有天考虑让他做命名合伙人
if we'll someday consider making him name partner.

856
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,330
我们为什么要那么做
Why the hell would we do that?

857
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,220
因为我让他去挖墙脚
Because I sent him to poach a department

858
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,370
结果对方给了他份工作邀请
and instead they offered him a job.

859
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,120
我明白了
I get it.

860
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,860
没人想来  所以你的办法就是
Nobody wants to come here, so your answer

861
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,740
给我们屋檐下的敌人
is to give our in-house enemy

862
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,210
他梦寐以求的升职
the promotion he's always wanted.

863
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,960
路易  以前是你最想让我这么做
Louis, you're the one who wanted me to do it before.

864
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,630
但你劝住了我
And you talked me out of it.

865
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,890
因为你是对的
Because you were right.

866
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,640
就像你以前总是对的
Just like you used to be right about everything.

867
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,710
可现在你好像总是做错事
But now it seems like you're wrong about everything.

868
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,990
你这话什么意思
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

869
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,880
我刚接到那20所学校里最后一所的消息
I just heard back from the last of those 20 schools.

870
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,370
结果是他们跟哈佛的意见一致性
And it turns out they have a lot more in common

871
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,280
比我们想得要强多了  因为他们
with Harvard that we thought, because none of them

872
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,670
都不想跟我们扯上关系
wants to do anything to do with us

873
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,190
因为我们的领导糟透了
because our leadership sucks.

874
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,000
小心你的语气  路易
You watch yourself, Louis.

875
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,420
我不用小心
I don't need to watch myself.

876
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,060
我需要在你屁股底下点把火
I need to light a fire under your ass.

877
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,920
因为我们的未来要溜走了
because our future is slipping away,

878
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,850
而给杰克命名合伙人地位
and offering Jack name partner

879
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,480
或是跟上帝祈祷哈维
or praying to god that Harvey

880
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,120
能把迈克的案子摆平
just gets Mike off the hook

881
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,040
都没法阻止这事发生
isn't going to stop it from happening.

882
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,140
好  路易
Okay, Louis.

883
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,230
你想做点祈祷之外的事
You want to do something more than pray,

884
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,720
哈维在想办法给迈克脱罪
Harvey gets Mike acquitted,

885
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,510
你现在就滚去哈佛
then you get your ass back up to Harvard

886
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,060
确保希拉不会出现在庭审上
and you make sure Sheila doesn't show up to that trial.

887
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,260
唐娜
Hi, Donna.

888
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,100
有...
Is there, um...

889
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,190
有什么我能帮忙的吗
Is there something I can help you with?

890
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,110
我只是想说我很遗憾
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry

891
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,860
为院长那件事
about what happened with the dean.

892
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,820
我很高兴迈克解决掉它了
And I'm glad that Mike took care of it.

893
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,580
谢谢你
Thank you.

894
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,880
我很抱歉...
I'm sorry that...

895
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,740
我在整个过程中都没来看你
that I didn't come to you with this whole thing,

896
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,540
但我...
But I-I...

897
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,120
他们在给你施压  要你背叛哈维
They were pressuring you to turn on Harvey

898
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,560
而以我们上次对话情况看
and based on our last conversation,

899
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,110
你不认为我是讨论那事的合适人选
you didn't think I was the right person to talk to about that.

900
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,730
一如既往地  你是对的
As usual, you're right.

901
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,260
瑞秋  我生气是因为我不愿去想
Rachel, I got upset because I didn't want to think

902
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,680
我必须在哈维和我爸爸间做选择时
about what I do if I have to choose

903
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,240
会怎么做
between my dad and Harvey.

904
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,240
因为这整个情况都糟透了
Because this whole situation sucks.

905
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,670
我们可能得做很艰难的选择
And we may have to make hard choices,

906
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,390
而我想告诉你无论你做什么
and I want you to know that no matter what you do,

907
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,770
你是我的朋友
you're my friend.

908
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,440
我会永远爱你
And I will always love you.

909
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,980
我也会永远爱你
I will always love you too.

910
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,500
谢谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

911
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,640
我来只是因为我不希望你
I only came here because I don't want you

912
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,770
或迈克・罗斯或者这律所的任何人
or Mike Ross or anyone else from this firm

913
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,840
再出现在我的律所
showing up at my firm ever again.

914
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,660
所以要我帮你做什么
So what can I do for you?

915
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,580
我在想你说的
I was thinking about what you said

916
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,390
我不会跟自己承认真相的话
about me not admitting things to myself

917
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,090
而我想聊聊
and I wanted to talk to you about it.

918
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,640
为什么
Why?

919
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,980
我想让你知道真相
I wanted you to know the truth.

920
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,510
真相又是什么
And what exactly is the truth?

921
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,980
我们分手不是因为迈克
Our relationship didn't end because of Mike.

922
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,590
而是因为我没有准备好
It ended because I wasn't ready to confront

923
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,080
面对自己的问题
what was wrong with me, 

924
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,860
我不知道我是否能准备好  但...
and I don't know if I'll ever be ready, but...

925
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,240
我在见心理医生  我希望告诉你这事
I've been seeing someone, and I wanted to tell you about it.

926
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,310
我知不知道有什么价值呢
And why does it matter that I know that?

927
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,860
因为如果我能安然渡过这件事
Because if I ever get out of this in one piece,

928
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,530
我想知道能不能再联系你
I want to know if is okay to call you again.

929
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,680
哈维  你永远都可以联系我
Harvey, it's always okay to call me.

930
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,490
我自己其实也在见心理医生
I've actually been going to therapy myself,

931
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,120
我也不知道整件事结束后
and I don't know where I'll be

932
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,740
我会走到哪一步
when this whole thing is over.

933
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,980
但我非常希望你能安然渡过
But I do hope that you get out of this thing in one piece.

934
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,650
打扰下
Excuse me.

935
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,020
抱歉  我...
Hi, excuse me. I, uh--

936
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,500
我不确定您是不是认识我
I'm not sure if you know who I am--

937
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,310
我在这里工作过两个月  瑞秋
I worked here for two months, Rachel.

938
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,860
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

939
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,450
我只是  想说我知道
I just--I wanted to say that I know

940
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,370
你被扯进了这场较量
that you got caught in the crossfire.

941
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,040
我知道那种感觉
And I know how that feels.

942
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,550
我想说我很抱歉
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

943
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,770
-谢谢你  -没关系
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

944
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,690
瑞秋
Rachel.

945
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,760
你有想过这一切结束后会怎么样吗
Have you thought about what may happen when this is all over?

946
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,650
你是说如果迈克进了监狱
You mean if Mike goes to jail.

947
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,860
我是说就算他没进
I mean even if he doesn't.

948
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,100
什么意思
What are you talking about?

949
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,440
就算他被判无罪  也有很大可能
Even if he is acquitted, there is an excellent chance

950
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,620
被撤销执照
he will be thrown out of the bar

951
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,160
永远无法执业
and never be able to practice law again.

952
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,450
那不重要  因为迈克已经准备好
It wouldn't matter, because Mike is prepared

953
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,270
永远不再执业了
to never practice law again anyway.

954
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,420
有时人觉得自己准备好了
And sometimes people think they're prepared

955
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,870
但其实他们没有
and they're not.

956
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,260
我不懂
I don't understand.

957
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,900
瑞秋  迈克得看着你去做
Rachel, Mike is going to have to watch you do

958
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,360
他梦想的工作
what he dreams of doing,

959
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,730
如果他跟哈维有一点相像的话
and if he's anything like Harvey,

960
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,850
他可能会觉得他能比你做得好
he probably thinks he can do it better than you.

961
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,270
那就有可能
And there is a possibility

962
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,280
他会为此怨恨你
that he might resent you for it.

963
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,060
我感谢你的建议
I appreciate the advise.

964
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,650
但迈克不是那样的人
But Mike is not like that.

965
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,370
那我很抱歉我说话过界了
Then I'm sorry I overstepped my bounds.

966
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,780
路易
Louis.

967
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,080
你在这里干嘛
What are you doing here?

968
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,920
我们已经谈过了
We've been over this.

969
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,560
我没什么可做的
There's nothing I can do--

970
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,150
我不是为了新律师来的
I'm not here about the associates.

971
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,420
我需要你收下这个
I need you to take this.

972
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,370
-那是什么  -这是去阿根廷的机票
- What's that? - It's a ticket to Argentina.

973
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,280
我需要你去那儿待到审判结束
I need you to go there until the trial is over.

974
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,560
我为什么要那么做
And why would I do that?

975
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,740
因为你在那儿  传票就没效力了
Because the prosecution has no power to subpoena you there.

976
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,030
我来说清楚  你想让我逃出国去
Let me get this straight. You want me to flee the country,

977
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,920
好让你保住你自己
so you can protect yourself.

978
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,430
我想让你逃出国去  保护你自己
I want you to flee the country so you can protect yourself.

979
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,230
-路易  -希拉  你去出庭作证
- Louis-- - Sheila, you take that stand,

980
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,850
就会说出伤害我们的话
and you're gonna say things that hurt us,

981
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,970
就意味着哈维会说伤害你的话
which means Harvey is going to say things that hurt you

982
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,540
而我没法承受那个
and I will not be able to handle that.

983
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,040
事实不会伤害我  路易
The truth isn't gonna hurt me, Louis.

984
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,160
赛斯女士  当你声名
Isn't it true, Ms. Sazs, that while you claim

985
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,220
没人能在未授权状态下进入哈佛档案室
no one had unauthorized access to the Harvard file room,

986
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,050
你是否犯了失职之错
there were times you were derelict in your duties?

987
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,110
我一生从未失职
I've never been derelict in my life.

988
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,610
那怎么解释就在庭上
Then how does that explain the fact that there's a man

989
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,600
就有一名未被授权
in this courtroom that had unauthorized access

990
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,650
却曾进入的人呢
to that very room?

991
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,900
-路易  拜托  -是因为你跟那人
- Louis, please. - Was it because you had

992
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,210
有过一段感情吗
a relationship with that man?

993
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,720
一段最终未能成正果的感情
A relationship that ultimately failed?

994
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,800
-那跟...  -案情无关吗
- That's not-- - relevant?

995
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,710
关系大了
It's more than goddamn relevant!

996
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,460
因为他跟你分手时
Because when he broke up with you,

997
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,110
你开始散布这恶毒的流言来攻击他
you started this vicious rumor to get back at him.

998
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,960
那是谎话  都是谎言
That's a lie. Those are all lies.

999
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,970
你跟他发生性关系
It is a lie that you had sex with that man,

1000
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,670
还把他一个人留在
and left him alone in the supposedly

1001
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,210
本应不许进入的哈佛档案室  也是谎言吗
impenetrable Harvard file room?

1002
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,840
路易  这会让我丢掉工作
Louis, this could cost me my job.

1003
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,710
该死  哈维根本不在乎
Goddamn it! Harvey is not gonna care.

1004
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,210
不
No.

1005
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,270
那不是谎话
It's not a lie.

1006
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,710
如果你让他进去了
And if you did that with him...

1007
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,440
我们为什么要相信
why should we believe

1008
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,930
你不会让别人进去
you didn't do that with others?

1009
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,510
对不起
I'm sorry.

1010
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,970
希拉  我只是想保护你
Sheila, I'm only trying to protect you.

1011
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,950
如果你真想保护我
If you really wanted to protect me,

1012
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,280
就不会告诉哈维这些事
you wouldn't tell Harvey those things in the first place.

1013
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,090
他会希望我告诉他
He's gonna want me to tell him.

1014
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,040
任何我知道的能帮上他忙的事
Anything I know that would help.

1015
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,850
你让我不要逼你说谎
You asked me to not make you lie.

1016
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,020
那求你  不要逼我对他说谎
Please, don't ask me to lie to him.

1017
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,040
好  路易
Okay, louis.

1018
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,290
我走
I'll go.

1019
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,330
你还在这里干什么
What are you still doing here?

1020
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,010
我们还有个审判呢
We've still got a trial coming up.

1021
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,980
我要做好全面的辩护准备
I'm gonna make any headway on my defense,

1022
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,190
我得走了
I need to get going.

1023
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,430
你要辩护
Your defense?

1024
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,360
是的
Yes.

1025
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,740
我来辩护
My defense.

1026
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,980
你是在说我觉得你在说的话吗
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

1027
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,820
因为对这事一直有个评价
Because there's an expression about that.

1028
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,630
就是"你要那么想  那你就是蠢货"
It says, "If you're thinking it, you're a fool."

1029
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,500
你听到了  她说
You heard her. She said,

1030
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,580
"事实就是我不是律师"
"The fact is that I'm not a goddamn lawyer."

1031
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,320
那唯一改变那个事实的办法就是
Well, the only way to change that fact is for a jury

1032
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,940
让陪审团看到我是个律师
to see me being a goddamn lawyer.

1033
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,230
你要那么做  他们看到的就只是
You try that, all they're gonna see

1034
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,700
该进监狱的某人
is someone going to prison.

1035
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,450
那是胡话  我能搞定她
That's bullshit. I can handle her.

1036
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,690
你都没参与过
You've never even gone through

1037
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,050
刑事审判
a criminal trial before.

1038
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,930
是的  那你上次参与是什么时候
Oh, yeah, and when was the last time you did?

1039
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,190
几年前了
How many years ago was it?

1040
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,730
难以置信  你觉得你能比我强
I don't believe it. You think you're better than me?

1041
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,000
跟谁强没关系
This isn't about who's better.

1042
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,140
重点是谁对这案子更有利
It's about who's better for this case.

1043
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,050
是我命悬一线
And my life is on the line.

1044
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,310
如果我因为自己的行为栽了  那我认栽
If I go down because of my call, I can take it.

1045
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,040
如果是你让我栽了  我没法认
If I go down because of yours, I can't.

1046
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,840
这不光是你的命  是我们所有人的
This isn't just your life. This is all of ours.

1047
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,920
那就像我说的
Well, like I said,

1048
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,580
这是我的决定  我要做
it's my call and I'm making it.

1049
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,310
抱歉打扰你们
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1050
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,270
这事还没完
This isn't over.

1051
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,600
我刚看了一遍调查证据
I just finished going through discovery

1052
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,740
我们有麻烦了
and we have a problem.

1053
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,590
什么麻烦
What is it?

1054
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,400
他们找到了特雷弗
They found Trevor.
