{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,840
你的处决日期已经定下来了
Your execution date has been set.

16
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,240
-什么时候  -三十天后
- When? - 30 days.

17
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,260
你说过你会找到玛利亚
You said you were gonna find Maria.

18
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,940
你们有一周时间来找到证人
You have one week to find a witness.

19
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,150
一周后  他的行刑日期就不会再变了
After that, his execution date is set in stone.

20
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,440
我们已经找到那个向萨特提供信息的人了
We found the guy who's been feeding Sutter his information.

21
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,620
菲利普・亚伦  我知道
Phillip Allen. I know.

22
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,290
两个小时前他来找我签协议
He came by to cut a deal two hours ago,

23
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:23,970
我跟他签了
so I gave him one.

24
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,070
-不  你没有  -冷静
- No you goddamn didn't. - Relax.

25
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,270
就证监会而言  迈克直接指向那位证人
As far as the SEC is concerned, Mike lead directly

26
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,910
这将让那个该死的混蛋的余生
to the witness who's gonna put that piece of shit away

27
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,030
都在监狱中悲惨的度过
for the rest of his life.

28
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,440
但你只有一个短暂的机会  可以向证监会自首
You have a small window to come clean with the SEC

29
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,090
以免牢狱之灾
and save yourself.

30
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,460
我不会背叛我父亲
I would never turn on my own father.

31
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,290
我不是为了那个杂种进了监狱
I didn't take this deal for that son of a bitch.

32
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,830
我进来是为了我很爱的妻子
I took it for my wife.

33
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,570
如果你再未经我的允许找她
And if you ever contact her again without my blessing,

34
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,140
我对天发誓我会痛扁你
I swear to God, I will beat the shit out of you.

35
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,460
吉米・罗杰斯找到了你们要找的失踪的证人
Jim Rogers found your missing witness.

36
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,280
她三年前去世了
She died three years ago.

37
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,920
你要告发你的室友
You're informing on your roommate.

38
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,580
我很清楚  你不快点把我弄出去
I know it, and if you don't get me out of here soon,

39
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,250
你的室友也要知道了
your bunkmate's gonna know it, too.

40
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,310
他们取消了与迈克的交易
They pulled Mike's deal.

41
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,140
真该死  是我逼他投向了你们
Goddamn it, I drove that guy to you!

42
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,050
但如果我把事情告诉他们
If I tell them that,

43
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,040
他们就会发现我们动过手脚
they're gonna know what we did.

44
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,300
肖恩  求你了  一定还有
Sean, please, there's got to be

45
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,820
别的办法能达到目的
another way to make this happen.

46
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,680
抱歉  哈维  恐怕没有
I'm sorry, Harvey, there isn't.

47
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,720
杰西卡  我能和你聊两句吗
Jessica, can I talk to you for a second?

48
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,610
哈维  能等等吗
Harvey, can it wait?

49
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,440
我刚得知了一个死刑案的坏消息
I just got some bad news about our death row case.

50
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,700
不行
No, it can't.

51
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,130
-卡荷尔刚刚取消了迈克的协议  -什么
- Cahill just pulled Mike's deal. - What?

52
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,520
我以为他是个言出必行的人
I thought he was a man of his word.

53
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,840
他说不是他
He's saying it wasn't him.

54
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,440
是他的领导干的  但这有什么区别呢
It was his superiors, but what difference does it make?

55
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,790
当然有区别
It makes all the difference in the world,

56
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,710
如果是他做的  那你可以越过他上报
because if it's him, you can go over his head.

57
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,620
如果我越过他
I go over his head,

58
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,370
那所有人都知道我们是串通的了
everybody knows we're in on this thing together.

59
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,470
所以你的意思是
So what you're telling me is,

60
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,670
不仅迈克的协议被取消了
not only are they pulling Mike's deal,

61
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,560
你还毫无意义地输了一个案子
but you're going to lose this case for nothing?

62
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,590
是的
Yeah.

63
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,250
差不多就这个意思
I guess that's what I'm telling you.

64
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,450
那你肯定不想听到我要说的这些话
Then you're not gonna like what I have to say.

65
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,390
如果迈克出不来
But if Mike's not getting out,

66
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,740
-也许你应该赢了案子  -什么
- you might as well win. - What?

67
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,320
哈维  我们现在正在重整旗鼓
Harvey, we're in the middle of building ourselves back up.

68
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,370
如果你输了这场官司  我们就回到起点了
You lose this case, we take it in the knee.

69
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,480
杰西卡  这个人犯罪了
Jessica, the guy is guilty.

70
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,110
但你是他的律师
And you're his goddamn lawyer.

71
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,280
接了这个案子
And you took this case.

72
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,620
如果不是为了救迈克出来
And I never would have taken it

73
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,090
我根本不会接这个案子
if it wasn't to get Mike out.

74
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,950
但你确实接了
Well, you did take it.

75
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,130
这也将把我们打回原点
And if it's just gonna kick us back down the mountain,

76
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,810
我不在乎你用什么手段
then I don't care what it takes.

77
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,040
赢下这场官司
You win that goddamn case.

78
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,760
我们现在开始审理公诉人
We're gathered to hear the United States

79
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,490
对威廉・萨特内幕交易指控的案件
versus William Sutter on the charges of insider trading.

80
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,830
公诉人准备好进行开庭陈述了吗
Is the prosecution prepared to deliver its opening statement?

81
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,630
准备好了  法官大人
We are, Your Honor.

82
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,840
陪审团的各位女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

83
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,970
威廉・萨特近几十年
William Sutter has been earning outrageous returns

84
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,860
赚取了巨额的财富
for decades.

85
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,220
我相信辩方律师会试图
Now, I'm sure the defense is going to try to

86
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,400
说服你们萨特先生是凭借他的勇气
convince you Mr. Sutter trades with his gut

87
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,110
和直觉或是一些无法证实的神秘力量
or his instinct or some mysterious explanation

88
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,530
来进行交易的
that is impossible to verify.

89
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,530
但这并不是他财富的来源
But that isn't how he makes his money.

90
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,480
我们也可以证明这点
And we can prove it.

91
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,480
我们有一位证人记录了
We have a witness that can document giving

92
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,830
近十年他如何对威廉・萨特
inside information to William Sutter time

93
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,950
一次又一次的提供内幕消息
and time again over the last ten years.

94
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,300
当我们把这个证人带到你们面前后
And when we present that witness to you,

95
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,210
你们一定会跳起来
you'll be leaping out of your chair to convict

96
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,670
想要将这个人定罪
that man beyond a reasonable doubt.

97
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,700
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter.

98
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,380
他说的证人是什么意思
What the hell witness is he talking about?

99
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,960
这种事情不是应该要提前告知吗
Didn't it have to be in discovery?

100
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,280
他确实应该那样做
It sure as hell did.

101
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,850
你要怎么做
What're you gonna do about it?

102
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,530
我要阻止他那样做
I'm gonna stop it dead in its tracks.

103
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,450
斯佩克特先生
Mr. Specter,

104
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,730
辩方准备好进行开庭陈述了吗
is the defense ready to deliver its opening statement?

105
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,560
没有  法官大人  但我们准备好要求
No, Your Honor, but we are ready to request

106
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,290
进行三天的延迟了
an immediate three-day delay of these proceedings.

107
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,240
以什么理由
On what grounds?

108
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,880
公诉人知道理由
The prosecution knows what grounds,

109
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,940
因为他刚刚违反了告知原则
because he just violated the rules of discovery.

110
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,810
法官大人  
Your Honor,

111
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,110
我不知道他在说什么
I have absolutely no idea what he's talking about.

112
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,550
你知道  因为你刚刚在开庭陈述中
Yes, you do because you just introduced a witness

113
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,940
引入了一位证人
into your opening statement

114
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,750
我们之前从来没有听说过这个证人
and this is the first I'm hearing about it.

115
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,030
你之所以之前从来没有听说过这个证人
It's the first you're hearing about it

116
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,070
是因为这个证人昨天才出现
because the witness just came forward yesterday.

117
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,250
对不起  难道互联网瘫痪了吗
I'm sorry, did the Internet go down?

118
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,370
你的套餐流量用完了吗
Did you go over the limit on your friends and family plan?

119
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,820
因为你应该通知我们的
Because we're required to be notified

120
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,840
但我现在连这个人的名字都不知道
and I don't even know what this person's name is.

121
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,580
他叫菲利普・亚伦  他准备好
His name is Phillip Allen and he's prepared

122
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,760
要将那个人送到他该在的监狱里了
to put that man behind bars where he belongs.

123
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,300
卡荷尔先生  够了
Mr. Cahill, that's enough.

124
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,230
法官大人  我们需要三天时间对证人取证
Your Honor, we need three days to depose this witness.

125
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,140
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

126
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,390
他们知道自己要输了  这只是在拖延时间
They've lost, they know it, and they're just trying to stall.

127
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,040
那你在我的法庭上抛下这枚重磅炸弹之前
Then you should have thought of that before you decided

128
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,670
就该想到这点
to drop this bomb in my courtroom.

129
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,410
斯佩克特先生  给你三天时间
Mr. Specter, you have three days.

130
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,450
我没想到会这么快再见到你们
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

131
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,190
我们有些消息想当面告诉你
We have some news we wanted to give you in person.

132
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,070
我们找到玛利亚・戈麦斯了
We found Maria Gomez.

133
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,260
伦纳德  她三年前去世了
Leonard, she died three years ago.

134
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,940
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

135
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,710
意思是我们还有五天时间再去
It means that we have five more days to find

136
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,030
找一些有用的信息让你的案子重审
something we can use to get your case re-opened.

137
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,440
听起来像在用一种婉转的方式跟我说三十天后
That sounds like a polite way of telling me that in 30 days,

138
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,120
我就会死
I'm gone.

139
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,970
如果我们能有不止五天时间呢
And what if there was a way to get us more than five days?

140
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,900
那就抓住机会啊
Let's take it.

141
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,820
你在行刑时有权要求
You have the right to have a family member

142
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,410
一位家庭成员到场
present at your execution.

143
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,370
如果你有以为生病的亲属
If you have a relative that's sick,

144
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,900
需要康复以后才能赶来
who needs time to get better to travel,

145
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,060
我们就可以向法院请求延期
we can petition the court for a delay

146
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,850
而且他们必须同意
and they have to grant it.

147
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,580
我姨妈哈莉特  是她把我拉扯大的
The woman who raised me, my Aunt Harriet.

148
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,220
她患有多发性硬化症
She has MS.

149
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,380
但这也没什么用
But that's not gonna do us any good,

150
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,730
因为她不想和我扯上任何关系
because she doesn't want anything to do with me.

151
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,190
她从没来探视过你吗
She never came to visit you?

152
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,760
她觉得我是有罪的
She thinks I'm guilty.

153
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,750
说我让家族蒙羞了
Says I brought shame on the family.

154
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,700
就算这是真的  你如今也需要她
Even if you did, you need her now.

155
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,810
她必须明白这一点
She has to see that.

156
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,450
我联系过她  瑞秋
I reached out to her, Rachel,

157
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,900
我刚进来的那一年里联系了她无数次
a thousand times my first years here.

158
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,070
我写信告诉她  我最最需要的就是
I wrote her that there's nothing I needed

159
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,610
知道她是支持我的
more than to know that I had her support.

160
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,180
可既然她当时就没有支持我...
She didn't give it to me then, and...

161
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,470
现在也不会
she's not gonna give it to me now.

162
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,970
如果她知道
Well, maybe if she could see that

163
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,210
我们这样的人都相信你
two women like us believe in you,

164
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,500
她说不定也就会相信你了
then she'll be able to believe in you, too.

165
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,210
如果你们真能让她相信我
If you can make that happen,

166
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,060
那对我而言比什么都重要
that would mean the world to me.

167
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,640
我们会让她相信你的
Then we'll make that happen.

168
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,540
你刚刚那招很厉害啊
That was nice work in there.

169
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,380
我觉得这足以让我们争取到无效审判了
Think it was good enough to get us a mistrial?

170
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,450
无效审判
Mistrial?

171
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,320
你该庆幸他们刚才没直接判你有罪
You're lucky they didn't find you guilty after that.

172
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,870
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

173
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,350
别再糊弄我了  威廉
Enough bullshit, William.

174
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,390
这次不是证监会问你了  而是我问你
This isn't the SEC asking anymore, this is me.

175
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,690
菲利普・亚伦是谁
Who the hell is Phillip Allen

176
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,220
他又准备告诉他们些什么
and what the hell is he gonna tell them?

177
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,350
他是个投资银行家  曾经在我手下工作
He's an investment banker, used to work for me.

178
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,610
他不会和他们说任何关于我的事的
He's not gonna tell them shit about me

179
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,160
因为他完全不知道我的事
because he doesn't know shit about me.

180
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,110
那在他们说他是证人时你为何如此惊讶
Then why were you so surprised when they said they had him?

181
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,470
因为他能说我女儿的事
Because he can tell them about my daughter.

182
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,320
我明白了
I get it.

183
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,870
他把内部消息透露给她
He gives inside information to her,

184
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,660
所以假如东窗事发了
so if this goes down,

185
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,960
出事的就是她而不是你
she goes down instead of you.

186
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,480
不会有人出事的
No one's going down.

187
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,230
因为他们无法证明
'Cause they can't prove

188
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,810
她把他透露给她的消息告诉了我
she told me what he told her.

189
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,230
也就是说  假如你做好你的工作
Which means, if you do your job,

190
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:01,990
我俩就没事了
we both get off.

191
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,830
威廉  你这是在冒个大险
William, you're taking a huge risk.

192
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,090
你以为我雇你这样一个枪手是干什么用的
What the hell you think I hired a gunslinger like you for?

193
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,620
所以别再告诉我赢不了
So stop telling me I can't win

194
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,660
好好工作  开始赢吧
and go ahead and start winning.

195
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,970
你每早都吃鸡蛋
You keep eating eggs every morning,

196
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,870
会得心脏病的
you're gonna have a heart attack.

197
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,960
你没听说吗
Didn't you hear?

198
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,190
现在鸡蛋又对人体有益了
They're good for you now.

199
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,130
假如五年之后
What happens five years from now

200
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,980
又变成有害了呢
when they become bad for you again?

201
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,430
你是担心我会出事吗
Worried something's gonna happen to me?

202
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,070
我是担心自己得应付个新室友
I'm worried I'm gonna have to deal with another roommate.

203
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,110
我花了好长一段时间才适应了你
Took me long enough to get used to you.

204
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,140
凯文...
Kevin...

205
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,170
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

206
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,260
都过去了
Water under the bridge.

207
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,770
你是为了我着想
All right? You had my best interest in mind.

208
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,880
要培根吗
You want some bacon?

209
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,200
这玩意无论何时都是对人体有益的
Man, that's always gonna be good for you.

210
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,590
同意  老弟
Amen to that, brother.

211
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,340
瞧瞧这是谁  俩基友啊
Look who it is. Frick and Frack.

212
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,810
我们正在谈话呢  加洛
We're in the middle of a conversation, Gallo.

213
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,440
可不是嘛
Oh, I bet you are.

214
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,200
迈克真是一位很棒的倾听者  是不是  凯文
Mike here's an excellent listener, isn't he, Kevin?

215
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,870
-你想要什么  -什么都不要
- What do you want? - Nothing.

216
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,250
就是看你俩关系这么好我心里高兴
It's just nice to see you guys are such good friends.

217
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,510
很高兴看到你俩能相互信任
Nice to know you can trust each other.

218
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,990
我只希望自己能信任
I only wish I could trust that

219
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,960
迈克是真的在帮我争取假释
Mike here was really working on getting me out on parole.

220
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,940
我们在争取
We are working on it.

221
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,970
你们快没时间了
Well, you're running out of time.

222
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,920
你听我说好吗  加洛
Would you listen to me, Gallo?

223
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,770
不  没什么好听的
No, there's no listening!

224
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,300
你今晚六点之前必须把哈维找来这里
You got until 6:00 tonight to get Harvey down here

225
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,930
不然的话
or after that,

226
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,540
我就自己安排一个听证会
I'm gonna schedule a little hearing of my own.

227
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,200
-我能帮到你什么吗  -我希望如此
- Can I help you? - I hope so.

228
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,230
我是瑞秋・赞恩
My name's Rachel Zane.

229
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,370
我是你外甥案子的律师
And I'm a lawyer working on your nephew's case.

230
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,580
我外甥的案子很早以前就结了
My nephew's case was over a long time ago.

231
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,590
谢天谢地
And thank God for that.

232
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,570
女士
Ma'am.

233
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,340
我来这是因为我们相信
I'm here because we believe

234
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,220
伦纳德是被冤枉的
Leonard was wrongly convicted of those murders.

235
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,330
他们都这么狡辩的  不是吗
Well, that's what they all say, isn't it?

236
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,210
但是就因为他愚弄了你
But just because he suckered you,

237
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,520
不意味着他能愚弄我
doesn't mean he's gonna sucker me.

238
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,110
他没有愚弄谁
He didn't sucker anyone.

239
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,800
我看了证据  我逐渐了解了他
I looked at the evidence and I got to know the man.

240
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,950
所以你有证据证明他没杀人吗
So you got proof he didn't do it?

241
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,980
我们正在努力
We're working on it.

242
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,410
但假如我们无法找到办法推后处决
But if we can't find a way to push back the execution,

243
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,020
那么在三十天之后这一切就都没意义了
then in 30 days it won't matter anymore.

244
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,740
你想要我怎么做
What do you want from me?

245
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,000
我希望你能请求法院延期
I want you to ask the court for a delay

246
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,410
好让你在他被处决时陪着他
so you can be with him at his execution.

247
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,600
我不会去看他被处决的
I'm not gonna watch him die.

248
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,430
迪恩女士  求你了
Ms. Deon, please.

249
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,690
是你把他带大的
You raised him.

250
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,780
伦纳德十四岁到十七岁是我带的
I raised Leonard from when he was 14 to 17.

251
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,020
我接纳了他  用心爱他
I took him in, I loved him,

252
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,600
他过去就不是什么好人  现在也不是
He was no good then and he's no good now.

253
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,320
既然如此
Well, if that's the case,

254
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,560
你就不用去看处决了
you don't have to be at the execution.

255
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,020
但假如你能签了这份请愿
But if you could sign this request

256
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,190
表明自己这个月太虚弱  不能长途跋涉
that says you're too infirm to travel this month,

257
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,290
这至少能给他一个机会证明你错了
it will at least give him the chance to prove you wrong.

258
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,850
我会签了这份请愿的
I'll sign your letter.

259
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,160
但我不会去看他被处决的
But I'm not watching him die.

260
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,350
谢谢你
Thank you.

261
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,320
你在这里呢
There you are.

262
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,080
我一早上都坐立不安
I've been on pins and needles all morning.

263
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,160
晚餐如何
How was dinner?

264
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,870
完完全全是一场闹剧  唐娜
It was a complete and total shit show, Donna.

265
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,630
路易  发生什么事了
Louis, what happened?

266
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,570
发生的事情是
What happened was,

267
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,150
我发现我的梦中女神有主了
I found out the woman of my dreams is spoken for.

268
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,510
-她结婚了  -也有可能
- She's married? - She might as well be.

269
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,740
她有个住在加州的长期男友
She has this long-term boyfriend who lives in California

270
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,700
他们互相允许对方和别人约会
and they have this arrangement where they see other people.

271
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,700
即便如此  这也是我一生中最美妙的一晚
And even though it was the most wonderful night of my life,

272
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,390
我要继续前进了
I'm moving on.

273
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,710
我不明白
I don't understand.

274
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,590
你一生中最美妙的一晚
The most wonderful night of your life?

275
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,760
你到底为什么还要留在那里吃完晚餐啊
Why did you even stay through dinner?

276
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,730
因为她说我是唯一一个
Because she gave me some line about being the only person

277
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,500
和她这样做的人
she'd ever done this with.

278
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,270
但如今我回过头来想想
But now that I think about it,

279
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,850
这又能改变什么呢
what the hell difference does that make?

280
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,420
我觉得这能改变一切
I think it makes all the difference in the world.

281
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,690
什么意思
What're you talking about?

282
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,300
路易  假如你真的是唯一一个
Louis, if you're really the only man

283
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,340
和她这样做过的人
she's ever done this with,

284
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,580
那这就意味着你有
then that means you've got something

285
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,200
那个男人没有的东西
that this other man doesn't have.

286
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,120
你怎么知道
How could you know that?

287
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,180
他们在一起三年
They've been together three years.

288
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,160
我比不了
I can't compete with that.

289
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,370
因为人幸福的时候
Because when you're happy,

290
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,280
不会去想别的
you don't go looking somewhere else.

291
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,830
唐娜
Donna--

292
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,460
路易  我告诉过你我跟米歇尔分手
Louis, I told you I broke up with Mitchell,

293
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,120
但是没有告诉你为什么
but I didn't tell you why.

294
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,440
他移情别恋了
He wanted to see other people.

295
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,060
他想搬来跟我一起住
He wanted to move in with me.

296
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,690
当他提出来  我开始想象跟他一起的生活
And when he asked me, I started picturing a life with him.

297
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,500
我就知道他不是我的真命天子
And that's when I knew he wasn't the right one for me.

298
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,160
我怎么知道我是她的命中注定
How can I know I'm the one for her?

299
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,100
你无法知道
You can't.

300
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,740
但是如果你不努力  就永远不会知道
But you'll never know if you don't fight for her.

301
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,560
哈维・斯佩克特办公室
Harvey Specter's office.

302
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,020
丹伯里联邦监狱有人向你致电
You have a call from Danbury Federal Prison.

303
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,840
-你是否愿意  -愿意
- Do you accept-- - Yes.

304
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,170
唐娜  是我  我得跟他谈谈
Donna, it's me, I need to talk to him.

305
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,460
他不在  迈克  他在法庭上
I don't have him, Mike, he's in court.

306
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,710
我不在乎他在哪里
I don't care where he is.

307
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,160
我得知道加洛的保释听证会怎么样了
I need to know what's going on with Gallo's parole hearing.

308
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,870
没怎么样
Nothing's going on.

309
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,750
没怎么样是什么意思
What the hell do you mean "Nothing's going on"?

310
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,860
哈维想着在他去做之前
Harvey was hoping that you were gonna be out of there

311
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,110
你就能出来了
before he had to go through with it.

312
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,930
该死的  唐娜
Goddamn it, Donna,

313
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,460
加洛知道我跟卡荷尔的事了
Gallo knows about me and Cahill.

314
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,200
如果他今天看不到进展
If he doesn't see some progress by the end of the day,

315
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,540
他就会去告诉凯文
he's gonna tell Kevin.

316
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,730
迈克  哈维还不想告诉你  但是
Mike, Harvey didn't want you to know this yet, but...

317
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,070
你跟卡荷尔之间没什么事了
there is no you and Cahill.

318
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,900
-什么  -卡荷尔取消了你的协议
- What? - Cahill pulled your deal.

319
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,790
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

320
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,800
他的上司说
His superiors said

321
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,630
你没有兑现你的承诺
you didn't hold up your end of the bargain.

322
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,900
胡说八道
That is bullshit!

323
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,440
我忙前忙后就是为了实现承诺
I've been busting my ass to hold up my end of the bargain.

324
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,910
我知道  哈维也知道
I know that and Harvey knows that,

325
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,790
他正在努力把你的协议要回来
and he's trying to get your deal back.

326
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,370
你去告诉他
Well, you tell him that while he's getting around

327
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,360
在他想要让卡荷尔说话算话的时候
to making Cahill honor his goddamn word,

328
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,790
或许可以花点时间履行自己做出的承诺
maybe he could take just a minute to honor his word

329
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,930
把加洛该死的保释听证会弄好
and get Gallo his goddamn parole hearing.

330
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,360
-我拿到了  -她签了吗
- I got it. - She signed it?

331
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,540
签了  还有她医生的宣誓证词
She did, and an affidavit from her doctor, too.

332
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,800
好的  我会去法庭把这件事搞定
All right, I'll go to court and make this happen.

333
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,370
你赶紧把我们手上的每一份证据都看一遍
You start going back through every piece of evidence we have

334
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,550
尽管这给了我们一丝喘息的机会去找证据
because this gives us some breathing room

335
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,270
但我们还是得找到才行
to find something, but we have to deliver.

336
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,280
-杰西卡  -听着  瑞秋
- Jessica... - Look, Rachel,

337
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,550
我知道你想跟我一起出庭
I know you want to go to court with me,

338
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,160
但是我们没有时间
but we don't have the time--

339
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,890
-不  我不是想说这个  -那是什么
- No, that's not it. - Well, then what is it?

340
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,050
她虽然签了申请  但是
She signed the request, but...

341
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,740
她并没有真的同意来见他
she wouldn't actually agree to be there with him if--

342
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,470
瑞秋
Rachel.

343
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,090
我们的工作不是当最坏的结果发生时
It's not our job to reunite him with his family

344
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,870
为他重系亲情
if it comes to it.

345
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,600
而是确保不让最坏的情况发生
It is our job to make sure it doesn't come to it.

346
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,650
我是说她不想来
I meant she doesn't want to come

347
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,340
是因为她认为他有罪
because she thinks that he did it.

348
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,070
如果我们没办法让他自己的姨妈相信他无辜
And if we can't convince his own aunt that he's innocent,

349
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,520
我们要怎么说服十二个陌生人
how are we gonna convince 12 strangers?

350
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,740
现在我更看重的是
Right now, I'd rather focus on the fact that

351
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,950
我们多给了他三十天来拯救自己
we're getting the man another 30 days to save his life.

352
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,220
迈克  坐下
Mike, sit down.

353
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,160
我得跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

354
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,600
卡荷尔昨天取消我的协议的时候
You needed to talk to me yesterday

355
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,470
你就该跟我谈谈了
when Cahill decided to pull my deal.

356
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,420
他说是他上面的人
He's saying it was the people above him.

357
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,770
我当时不想
And I didn't want to tell you about it

358
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,300
没有想好解决方案就告诉你
until I figured out how to get it back.

359
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,830
你不告诉我的事情
Yeah, well the amount of things you're not telling me

360
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,130
真的开始越来越多了
are really starting to pile up.

361
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,890
我知道你发现了加洛的事情
I know you found out about Gallo.

362
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,940
对不起
I'm sorry.

363
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,720
但是我向你保证  我已经在解决了
But I give you my word, it's being taken care of.

364
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,380
就像解决我的协议一样吗
Oh, like my deal was being taken care of?

365
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,980
听我说
Listen to me.

366
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,750
我会解决菲利普・亚伦
I'm gonna neutralize Phillip Allen

367
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,370
这样你还是有机会从这里出去
so you still have a chance to walk out of here.

368
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,040
但你要是不能让吉尔・米勒出来指正她爸
But that's not gonna happen if you don't get Jill Miller

369
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,080
这一切都白费了
to testify against her father.

370
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,410
该死的  哈维  我已经试过了
Goddamn it, Harvey, I've been down that road.

371
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,230
吉尔是不会这样做的  凯文也不会
Jill's not gonna go for it and neither is Kevin.

372
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,040
那你最好想办法逼他
Well, then you better figure out a way to make him,

373
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,630
因为一旦我搞定菲利普・亚伦
because once I blow Phillip Allen out of the water,

374
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,770
卡荷尔下一个要找的就是凯文的老婆
the next person up on Cahill's hit list is Kevin's wife.

375
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,780
-你好  -塔拉
- Hello? - Hey, Tara.

376
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,960
是我  路易・利特
It's me, Louis Litt.

377
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,570
我知道你是谁  路易
I know who you are, Louis,

378
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,420
你不用连名带姓一起说
you don't have to use your last name.

379
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,920
我只是不想自以为是
Well, I don't like to be presumptuous.

380
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,340
你可能有另一个男人  我是说
I mean, you can have another man--I mean--

381
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,590
你可能认识其他叫路易的人
you can have another Louis in your life.

382
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,680
说到其他男人  路易
Speaking of other men, Louis.

383
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,410
我很高兴你回了电话
I'm glad you called back.

384
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,690
我那天晚上很开心
I had an amazing time the other night,

385
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,430
不过我不确定你能不能接受
but I wasn't sure you were okay with

386
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,210
我跟你说的我有
what I told you about me having a--

387
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,110
拜托  塔拉  这都2016年了
Oh, please, Tara, it's 2016.

388
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,670
如果一个男人不能接受他的女人跟其他人约会
If a man can't be okay with his woman seeing other men,

389
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,620
那苏珊・安东尼之前的奋斗是为了什么
then what was Susan B. Anthony even fighting for?

390
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,580
如果是这样的话  路易・利特
Well in that case, Louis Litt,

391
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,120
今晚约吗
how'd you like to go out tonight?

392
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,970
今晚
Tonight?

393
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,580
乐意之至
I'd love to.

394
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,380
那你告诉我地点
Then tell me where to be,

395
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,190
我七点准时去找你
and I'll meet you there at 7:00 p.m. sharp.

396
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,670
好的
Okay.

397
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,160
杰西卡・皮尔逊上庭
Jessica Pearson in court.

398
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,530
我可是很久没见到了
I haven't seen that in a while.

399
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,780
我喜欢时不时上场活动一下
I like to get back in the ring from time to time.

400
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,750
那你今天要兼并哪家大公司
So what giant companies are you merging today?

401
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,430
钢铁巨怪和环球万物吗
Behemoth Steel and Global Everything?

402
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,590
那是星期二的事
That was Tuesday.

403
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,790
今天  我是来救人一命的
Today, I am here to save a man's life.

404
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,720
我们接了一个"无罪计划"的案子
We took over an Innocence Project case.

405
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,810
"无罪计划"
Innocence Project?

406
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,460
你是想做什么  重塑你们公司的形象吗
So what're you trying to do, rehabilitate your firm's image?

407
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,210
我想做的事帮助一个人伸张正义
What I'm trying to do is help a man get justice.

408
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,910
如果这样能提升公司形象  那就更好了
And if doing that helps my firm look good, even better.

409
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,790
说得好
Fair enough.

410
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,610
你过得怎么样  杰夫
How have you been, Jeff?

411
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,630
挺好
I've been good.

412
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,440
我知道我说等这件事过去
Listen, I know we talked about me looking you up

413
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,690
我会去看你  但是
when this whole mess was over, but...

414
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,250
-我想告诉你  -没事  杰西卡
- I want you to know-- - It's okay, Jessica.

415
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,540
我理解
I understand.

416
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,230
不
No.

417
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,290
我是说  还没过去
What I mean is, it's not over.

418
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,630
我还在解决中
I'm still in it.

419
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,200
你真的是在努力重塑形象啊
You really are fighting to rehabilitate your image,

420
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,190
对吗
aren't you?

421
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,840
没错
I am.

422
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,100
很高兴见到你  杰西卡
It was good to see you, Jessica.

423
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,270
我也是  杰夫
It's good to see you too, Jeff.

424
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,420
你来干什么  肖恩
What're you doing here, Sean?

425
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,330
我来保护我的主要证人
I'm here to protect my star witness.

426
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,690
他有自己的律师
He's got his own attorney for that.

427
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,670
我不在乎
I don't care.

428
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,070
我们是来这里让你收集证据的
And we're here for you to get your discovery,

429
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,210
不用给我说什么程序
not lecture me on procedure.

430
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,050
我是来演示亚伦先生的
I'm here to demonstrate how Mr. Allen's

431
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,250
盘诘将如何进行的
cross examination's gonna go,

432
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,640
所以给我坐下
now sit the hell down.

433
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,600
亚伦先生  你指证我的委托人
Mr. Allen, what exactly are you getting in return

434
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,410
将得到什么好处
for your testimony against my client?

435
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,380
他将获得自己所犯罪行的豁免权
He's getting immunity for the crimes he committed.

436
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,660
庭上你也打算替他回答吗
Are you gonna answer for him when he's on the stand, too?

437
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,480
你都犯了什么罪
What were those crimes?

438
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,510
我给了威廉・萨特内部交易信息
I gave William Sutter inside information

439
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,710
已经有十余年了
over the course of a decade.

440
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,250
具体是怎么做的
And how, exactly, did you do that?

441
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,710
我的银行得到审查交易的委托
When my bank was hired to review a transaction

442
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,870
我确保交易将发生后
and I determined it was going through,

443
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,890
就电话联系吉尔・米勒
I'd call Jill Miller

444
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,330
告诉她相关方的名字
and I'd give her the relevant names of the parties.

445
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,160
吉尔・米勒  我不明白
Jill Miller? I'm confused.

446
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,110
你跟证监会说
You told the SEC

447
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,650
你是在给威廉・萨特内部信息
that you were feeding William Sutter inside information.

448
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,940
-我们有共识  -和谁
- We had an understanding. - Understood by who?

449
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,140
威廉・萨特
William Sutter.

450
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,880
你和萨特先生有过具体的对话吗
Did you ever have a specific conversation with Mr. Sutter?

451
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,660
你上一次和他见面
I mean, when was the last time

452
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,350
是什么时候
you were even in the same room?

453
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,260
吉尔说他懂的
Jill said that he understood.

454
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,190
胡扯  你根本无法证明威廉知道任何事情
Bullshit, you can't testify William understood anything.

455
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,370
-这叫道听途说  -这是真相
- It's called hearsay. - It's called the truth.

456
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,950
我不管你管它叫什么
I don't give a shit what you call it,

457
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,990
如果你没证据  陪审团就不会采信
if you don't have proof, the jury can never hear it.

458
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,550
你有证据吗
Do you have proof?

459
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,800
我真是不敢相信  你都没有纸面证据吗
Oh, I don't believe this, you don't have a paper trail.

460
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,110
-我有通话记录  -我是说和萨特相关的
- I have the phone records. - I mean to Sutter.

461
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,700
她是他女儿
She's his goddamn daughter!

462
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,740
每个杀人犯也都有父亲
Yeah, and every murderer has a father, too,

463
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,210
但不代表他们父亲就参与了犯罪
doesn't mean they're in on the crime.

464
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,570
你的巧词留到庭上用吧  哈维
Save your metaphors for the trial, Harvey.

465
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,310
现在就免了吧
We don't need them here.

466
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,790
我不需要为上庭留台词
I don't need to save anything for trial

467
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,450
因为你和这个人签的协议是白签了
because you made a deal with this man for nothing,

468
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,120
你给了我个绝好的证人
you handed me my best witness,

469
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,740
这个取证结束了
and this deposition's over.

470
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,460
你个混蛋  你怎么可以这么做
You son of a bitch. How dare you?

471
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,700
做什么  肖恩
How dare I what, Sean?

472
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,180
保护我的委托人吗
Defend my own client?

473
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,830
扯吧  你不是想保护你的委托人
Bullshit, you weren't trying to defend your client.

474
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,920
你是想毁掉我的案子
You were trying to ruin my case

475
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,430
因为你在为迈克的事生气
'cause you're pissed off about Mike.

476
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,460
我当然生气了
I sure as hell am.

477
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,480
我们有协定  你违反了
We had a deal and you broke it.

478
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,380
所以现在我也不打算维护协定了
So now I'm breaking it, too.

479
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,330
我告诉你  哈维
Well, you know what, Harvey?

480
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,110
你要破坏什么协定我都无所谓
I don't care what you're breaking,

481
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,930
因为菲利普・亚伦能让我抓到他女儿
'cause Phillip Allen gets me the daughter

482
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,070
她就能帮我抓到萨特
and that gets me right back to Sutter.

483
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,150
很好  正中我的下怀
Good, 'cause that's exactly what I'd expect you to do.

484
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,120
我理解了
Oh, I get it.

485
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,660
你不是想赢这个案子
You weren't trying to win this thing.

486
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,430
你只是想取消菲利普・亚伦的资格
You just wanted to discredit Phillip Allen

487
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,080
所以我只能再去和迈克交易
so I'd have no choice but to reinstate Mike's deal.

488
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,230
这当然是我希望的了
You're damn right that's what I wanted.

489
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,580
所以与其浪费时间
So instead of getting mad at me

490
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,390
气我做了本该你做的事
for doing what you should have done in the first place,

491
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,080
还不如赶紧加把火
why don't you start turning up the heat

492
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,870
好让迈克逼这个倒霉女人
so Mike can get this goddamn woman

493
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,300
告发她父亲
to turn on her father?

494
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,640
-凯文  -你终于来了
- Kevin. - Oh, good, you're here.

495
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,610
快忙死了
You can help.

496
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,980
我知道你让我保证了不再提起这件事
I know you made me promise not to bring this up again--

497
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,640
-迈克  我说了  -听我说
- Mike, I told you-- - Listen to me.

498
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,540
我跟哈维谈了
I just talked to Harvey.

499
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,840
一个叫菲利普・亚伦的人站出来要作证
A man named Phillip Allen has come forward and he's gonna--

500
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,030
等等  你和哈维说了
Wait, you talked to Harvey?

501
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,250
这个人和卡荷尔做了交易
Listen, this guy cut a deal with Cahill.

502
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,150
懂吗  说明他全都知道
All right? That means he knows all about it.

503
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,070
你要我做什么
What do you want from me?

504
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,300
我要你说服你妻子这事完了
I want you to convince her that this is it.

505
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,190
她只有一个获得赦免权的机会
She has a one-time chance of getting immunity

506
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,100
那就是现在告发她父亲
if she turns on her father now.

507
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,960
你到底怎么知道这个卡荷尔要这么做的
How the hell do you even know this Cahill guy'll do that?

508
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,890
因为我知道他有多想抓萨特
Because I know how bad he wants Sutter,

509
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,840
跟吉尔交易是他的唯一办法
and offering Jill a deal is the best way to make that happen.

510
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,570
但他也有可能保证交易  然后反悔
Or he promises her a deal, then takes it away.

511
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,190
结果就是我的两个孩子在接下来的两年里
And no one's kissing my kids good night

512
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,290
既没有父亲也没有母亲
for the next two years.

513
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,380
哈维不会让这种事发生的
Harvey wouldn't let that happen.

514
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,870
他是威廉的律师
He's William's lawyer.

515
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,430
他不会出卖自己的委托人的
He's not selling out his own client.

516
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,370
你也是他的委托人
You're his client, too.

517
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,030
那不过是为了保护那个给他付账的人
Only to protect the guy who's paying his bills.

518
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,210
他才不在乎我呢
He doesn't give a shit about me.

519
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,310
也许确实如此  但他在乎我
Maybe not, but he does give a shit about me!

520
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,950
你什么  你是什么意思
What're you-- what're you saying?

521
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,890
我是说吉尔要是交易
I'm saying that offering Jill a deal

522
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,250
不止她一个人不用坐牢
doesn't just get her out of prison.

523
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,430
我也能出狱
It gets me out, too.

524
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,220
你在告我的密  迈克
You've been informing on me, Mike?

525
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,710
是的
Yes.

526
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,650
别让我看见你  你这个叛徒
Get the hell out of my sight, you traitor piece of shit.

527
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,170
凯文  听着  我告诉你
Kevin, listen, I'm only telling you this

528
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:07,990
是为了让你明白
so that you'll see--

529
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,790
明白什么  明白你有多混蛋吗
See what? How full of shit you are?

530
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,530
告诉我你小时候就失去了双亲
Telling me you grew up without a mom and dad

531
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,280
也只是为了获取我的信任吧
just to gain my trust--

532
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,720
不是这样的
That is not why I did that.

533
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,840
而且我现在告诉你实话
And I just told you the truth

534
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,120
是为了让你相信我在意你
so that you trust that I care about you.

535
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,570
胡扯  因为你现在
Bullshit, 'cause here you are,

536
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,590
就是要让两个孩子失去双亲
willing to leave two little kids all alone

537
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,890
只为了你自己能出狱
just to get your goddamn freedom.

538
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,450
-凯文  我很抱歉  -还没到你抱歉的时候
- Kevin, I'm sorry-- - No, you're not.

539
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,720
但你马上就会了
But you're about to be.

540
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,800
来啊  还击啊  你个叛徒
Come on, fight! Fight back, you traitor!

541
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,520
-打我啊  -你听我说
- Fight me back! - You have to listen to me!

542
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,480
来啊  打啊
Come on, fight!

543
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,370
-这事没完  迈克  -赶快把他带走
- This isn't done, Mike! - Get him out of here now!

544
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,500
-不  不  不  -单独监禁
- No, no, no-- - Get him to solitary now!

545
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,010
不  不要单独监禁  这是我的错
No, not solitary! It's my fault, it's my fault!

546
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,600
-你们不用这样  -罗斯  罗斯
- You don't have to do this! - Ross, Ross!

547
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,050
再说一个字  你也去单独监禁
Another word, and you're going to solitary, too.

548
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,480
我是哈维・斯佩克特
Harvey Specter.

549
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,900
丹伯里联邦监狱有人向你致电
You have a call from Danbury Federal Prison.

550
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,180
你愿意承担费用吗
Do you accept the charges?

551
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,450
-愿意  -哈维
- Yes. - Harvey.

552
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,310
迈克  太好了
Mike, good.

553
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,200
我完成了我的任务  我解决菲利普・亚伦了
I did my part and I took care of Phillip Allen.

554
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,720
告诉我你完成了你让凯文说服妻子的任务
Tell me you did yours and got Kevin to talk to his wife.

555
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,330
我试过了
I tried.

556
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,890
但我把他弄进单独监禁了
Instead, I got him put in solitary.

557
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,580
什么  到底什么情况
What? How the hell did that happen?

558
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,910
我告诉他我一直在出卖他
I told him I was informing on him

559
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,570
然后他开始玩命揍我
and then he started beating the shit out of me.

560
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,020
你逗我呢  你为什么要告诉他
Are you kidding me? Why would you do that?

561
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,440
因为撒谎解决不了问题
Because lying wasn't getting it done

562
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,710
而我现在没那么多时间
and I'm living on borrowed time,

563
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,190
所以我觉得还是告诉他好了
so I thought I might as well tell him, anyway.

564
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,990
那你最好想办法把他弄出来
Then you better figure out a way to get him out of there,

565
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,910
因为我们得赶在卡荷尔之前
because we need to get Jill to turn on Sutter

566
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,180
说服吉尔告发萨特
before Cahill gets her to.

567
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,580
这就是我打给你的原因
That's why I'm calling you.

568
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,900
我已经有办法了  我只想知道
I already have a way, I just need to know

569
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,750
你完成了另一件你该做的事
you did that other thing you were supposed to do.

570
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,030
给加洛弄到了保释听证会
I need to know you got Gallo his parole hearing.

571
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,600
开始吧
Let's get to it.

572
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,430
情况如何
What happened?

573
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,580
好消息
Good news.

574
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,860
法庭准许了我们的动议
The court granted our motion.

575
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,690
他们把你的处决延后了一个月
They pushed your execution back a month.

576
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,840
我不敢相信
I don't believe it.

577
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,820
你们说服了我伯母我没杀那些人吗
You convinced my aunt I didn't kill those people?

578
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,210
-不  伦纳德  我没说服她  -我不懂
- No, Leonard, I didn't. - I don't understand.

579
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,910
你说她得到场的
You said that she had to agree to be there for me.

580
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,800
她同意签字
She agreed to sign the papers.

581
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,680
但她不会来
But she's not gonna come.

582
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,300
该死
Goddamn it.

583
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,290
伦纳德  别偏离重点
Leonard, don't take your eye off the ball.

584
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,600
这只是为了给我们争取时间
This was about buying us time.

585
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,140
你说我偏离重点
Take my eye off the ball?

586
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,820
你到底在不在乎我
Do you even give a shit about me?

587
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,120
我们当然在乎
Of course we do.

588
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,470
是  我知道你在乎
Yeah, I know you do.

589
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,700
但我想知道她在不在乎
But I want to know if she cares

590
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,010
我的生死
whether I live or die.

591
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,890
我刚把你的处决延后了
I just got your execution pushed back.

592
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,710
我问的不是这个
That's not what I asked you.

593
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,680
你都没去看她  对不对
You didn't even go see her, did you?

594
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,090
我要管理公司
I have a firm to run.

595
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,840
我们两个人中只要一个人拿到她的签名就行
And only one of us needed to get her signature.

596
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,320
但你们两个人本可以说服她
But two of you could've helped convince her

597
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,680
我是无辜的
that I'm innocent.

598
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,410
你不明白吗
Don't you get it?

599
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,870
抚养我长大的女人不想和我有任何瓜葛
The woman who raised me wants nothing to do with me.

600
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,690
伦纳德  我知道你很失望
Leonard, I know you're disappointed.

601
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,440
但我的职责
But it's not my job

602
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,140
不是帮你修复你和你姨妈之间的关系
to repair your relationship with your aunt.

603
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,040
我的职责是把你从这里弄出去
It's my job to get you out of here.

604
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,630
我根本就出不去了
I ain't never getting out of here!

605
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,170
你不明白吗
Don't you understand that?

606
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,790
你去和法庭周旋吧
So you go play your game with the courts.

607
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,360
但不管是三十天还是六十天  都无所谓
But whether it's 30 days or 60 days, it doesn't matter,

608
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,280
因为我会死在这里的  女士
'cause I'm gonna die in here, lady.

609
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,040
我只要求你做一件事  你都没做到
The one thing I asked you to do, you didn't.

610
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,170
你甚至都没有尝试一下
You didn't even care enough to try.

611
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,500
走吧
Just get out.

612
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,150
你最好是来告诉我我有听证会了
You better be here to tell me I have a hearing.

613
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,630
这就是我想跟你说的
That's exactly what I'm here to tell you.

614
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,500
但在你帮我干件事之前
But you're not gonna have anything

615
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,890
你什么都没有
unless you do something for me.

616
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,540
扯淡  我们协议里没这条
Bullshit. Wasn't part of the deal.

617
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,460
我才不管
I don't give a shit.

618
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,860
我受够了你总是威胁我
I'm tired of you threatening me,

619
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,030
如果你想有一丝提前离开这里的机会
so if you even want a chance of getting out of here early,

620
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,540
你得先给我干件事
you're gonna do something for me.

621
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,000
顺便跟你说
And by the way,

622
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,460
现在跟凯文说我告发他有点晚了
it's too late to tell Kevin that I've been informing on him.

623
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,980
我已经告诉他了
I already did.

624
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,610
你想干什么
What do you want?

625
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,070
我要你把他从单独监禁里弄出来
I need you to get him out of solitary.

626
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,900
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding me, right?

627
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,420
-我办不了  -扯淡
- I can't do that - That's bullshit.

628
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,610
我来的第一晚你就能换进我的牢房
You switched into my cell the first night and ever since,

629
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,410
从那时起你就一直吹嘘你在这里能干什么
you've been bragging about everything that you can do in here,

630
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,530
你还是别再跟我说你干不了
so how about you stop telling me that you can't do it,

631
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,520
就告诉我你到底干不干
and just tell me whether or not you will.

632
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,520
好吧  小迈克
All right, Mikey.

633
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,140
我给你搞到离开单独监禁的机会
I'll get your ticket to freedom out of solitary for you.

634
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,110
但如果你离开这里而我没有
But if you get out of here and I don't,

635
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,520
你要知道  在外面和在里面一样
you should know, i can get to you

636
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,590
我都能易如反掌地搞定你
just as easily out there as I can in here.

637
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,170
我说的"搞定你"
And when I say "Get to you,"

638
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,340
你要记得当初我做了什么
You got to remember what I did

639
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,270
才让哈维把我关在这里的
to make Harvey put me away in the first place.

640
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,080
你想谈谈监狱里的事情吗
Do you want to talk about what happened at the prison?

641
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,520
不  瑞秋  我不想
No, Rachel, I don't.

642
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,290
因为不管伦纳德信不信
Because whether Leonard believes me or not,

643
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,460
-我确实要管理公司  -我知道
- I really do have a firm to run. - I know you do.

644
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,030
那你应该知道今晚我离开这里之前
Then you know I have ten other things to do

645
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,530
还有很多其他事要完成
before I get out of here tonight.

646
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,830
那我就不管它了
Then I will leave it alone.

647
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,420
但不管怎样  受害人的父亲对我破口大骂时
But for what it's worth, you were there for me

648
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,230
是你关心我支持我
when the victim's father lashed out at me.

649
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,150
因此
And so,

650
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,500
如果你想找个人谈谈
if you want to talk about it with someone,

651
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,240
我只想告诉你  我也关心你
I just want you to know that I'm here for you, too.

652
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,010
谢谢你  瑞秋
I appreciate that, Rachel.

653
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,000
但现在  我更想让你把时间花在
But right now, I'd rather you spend your time

654
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,070
想办法让伦纳德・贝利出狱上
finding something to get Leonard Bailey out.

655
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,260
我会的
I will.

656
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,410
你好
Hello?

657
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,150
你好  杰夫  是我
Hi, Jeff, it's me.

658
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,060
今天晚上我们吃个饭如何
How would you like to have dinner with me tonight?

659
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,460
乐意奉陪  杰西卡
I would love to, Jessica.

660
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,980
告诉我地点就行
Just name the place.

661
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,190
怎么了
What?

662
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,100
没什么
Nothing.

663
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,000
上次和你来过以后我就再没有来过这里
I just haven't been in this place since I was here with you.

664
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,690
我记得你很喜欢这里
I remembered how much you liked it.

665
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,410
你为什么给我打电话
So how come you decided to call me?

666
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,320
你说你还没准备好
You said you were still in it.

667
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,540
你曾经跟我说过
You told me once

668
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,440
你相信事出皆有因
that you think maybe things happen for a reason.

669
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,210
你是指今天碰到我吗
You mean running into me today?

670
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,780
我是指那之后发生的事
I mean after I ran into you.

671
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,500
我基本上被指责为冷酷
I was pretty much accused of being cold,

672
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,880
无情且漠不关心
heartless, and uncaring.

673
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,750
如果是律师同行这么说我  我倒能接受
And I can take it when it's lawyers saying that about me.

674
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,940
但这个评价却是来自我正在救的人
But this was from the man whose life I'm trying to save.

675
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,270
所以你想跟一个了解
And you wanted to be with someone

676
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,070
你另一面的人待一会儿
who knows a different side of you.

677
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,720
我觉得我想跟某位知道
I thought I wanted to be with someone

678
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,930
那一面完全不是我的人待一会儿
who knows that's not a side of me at all.

679
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,340
杰西卡  我曾跟你说过我爱过你
Jessica, I told you I loved you once.

680
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,110
我说那句话的时候
And when I said that,

681
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,000
我想表达的是我爱你的其中一点
I meant that one of the things that I love about you

682
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,900
就是你那种能把感情放在一边
is your ability to push emotion aside

683
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,100
令对手满地找牙的能力
and knock the shit out of people.

684
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,290
所以你认为我是冷酷  但你却爱我这一点
So you think I'm cold, but you love that about me?

685
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,240
我是说那是我爱你的其中一点
I'm saying that's one of the things that I love about you.

686
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,680
另外一点是  在你的内心
The other thing is that in your heart,

687
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,000
你一点都不冷酷
you're not cold at all.

688
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,220
晚饭后怎么说  你带我回家吗
What do you say after dinner, you take me home?

689
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,370
我想说
I say...

690
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,700
我觉得我们这次应该慢慢来
I think that we should take it slow this time.

691
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,000
听着  我知道你现在很恨我
Listen, I know you hate me right now,

692
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,340
但现在这一刻
but right this second,

693
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,310
我们是同一战线的
we are on the same side.

694
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,060
我知道
I know.

695
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,190
-真的吗  -是的
- You do? - Yeah.

696
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,640
因为他们刚我从单独监禁中放出来
'Cause they just let me out of solitary,

697
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,020
然而我去打电话给吉尔
and I went to call Jill.

698
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,450
我本打算跟她全盘托出的
I was gonna tell her everything,

699
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,300
但在我有机会这么做之前
but before I got a chance to do that...

700
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,130
她跟我说她被起诉了
she told me she was indicted.

701
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,110
-凯文  我很抱歉  -我不需要道歉  迈克
- Kevin, I'm so sorry. - I don't need sorrys, Mike.

702
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,220
我需要找到个办法让我妻子免受牢狱之灾
I need to find a way to keep my wife out of prison.

703
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,310
-那就让我帮你  -你可以帮我
- Then let me help you. - You can help me.

704
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,970
但不能是试图让她指证她父亲的方法
But it can't be by trying to get her to turn on him,

705
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,040
因为我告诉你
because I'm telling you,

706
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,800
她是绝对没有可能会那么做的
there is no way in hell she's gonna do that.

707
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,240
你真的觉得她也愿意为了他进监狱吗
You really think she's willing to go to prison for him, too?

708
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,980
我发现她和她父亲这事的那天晚上
Look, the night I found out about her and her father,

709
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,730
我问她怎么能被卷进
I asked her how she could have gotten involved

710
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,010
这种事情里
in something like this.

711
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,430
原来  她发现他父亲的
Turns out, she found out

712
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,750
整个商业帝国就是场庞氏骗局
his whole place was a Ponzi scheme.

713
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,130
她对他大发雷霆
She flipped out on him

714
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,940
然后他跟她讲了个关于收益
and he gave her some bullshit sob story

715
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,270
是如何日益减少的狗屁悲伤故事
about how the returns were running dry.

716
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,390
他跟她说如果她能弄到内幕消息
He told her that if she got inside information for him,

717
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,570
只要一次  就能让他们免遭失去一切的厄运
one time, it'd keep them from losing eveverything.

718
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,690
而等她回过神来  收手已经来不及了
And the next thing she knew, it was too late to stop.

719
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,060
是的  他欺骗了她
Yeah, he tricked her.

720
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,670
而当我试图跟她说的时候
And when I tried to tell her that,

721
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,820
让她和我一起退出  你知道她说什么吗
get her to quit with me, you know what she said?

722
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,320
她说她绝不会那么做的
She said she'd never do that.

723
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,650
因为不管他在生意场上是怎么做的
Because no matter what he did with the business,

724
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,510
她都知道他会愿意为她赴汤蹈火
she knew he was willing to run into a burning building for her.

725
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,570
所以她也愿意为他做同样的事
So she was willing to do the same for him.

726
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,460
凯文  我需要你把手机给我用一下
Kevin, I need you to let me use your cell phone.

727
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,490
我需要你相信我
I need you to trust me.

728
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,720
-哈维・斯佩克特办公室  -唐娜  是我
- Harvey Specter's office. - Donna, it's me.

729
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,210
我需要你帮忙  我时间不多
I need your help and I don't have much time.

730
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:04,880
你需要我做什么
What do you need?

731
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,760
我觉得我有办法让吉尔说出实情了
I think I have a plan to get Jill to talk.

732
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,810
迈克  你难道不应该跟哈维说吗
Mike, shouldn't you be telling Harvey about this?

733
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,090
我等下就打给他
I'm calling him next.

734
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,760
但无论我们怎么做  除非你能先让她不抗拒
But whatever we do, we are not gonna be able

735
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,550
否则我们都没法让她说出实情的
to get her to talk unless you first get her to listen.

736
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,510
塔拉  我知道我4分钟前才打过电话
Hey Tara, I know I called four minutes ago

737
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,500
我也知道你说七点整
and I know you said 7:00 p.m. sharp,

738
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,780
但我现在觉得你说的是不是七点多
but now I'm thinking you said 7:00 P.M. short.

739
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,980
我不知道为什么会那样
And I don't know exactly why that would be,

740
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,610
但现在7点12分了  我就想
uh, but it's 7:12, and I'm just wondering what--

741
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,470
喂
Hello?

742
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,770
该死
Goddamn it.

743
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,540
路易
Louis.

744
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,350
我刚看到你打了两个电话给我
I just saw you called two times.

745
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,290
-很抱歉我迟到了  -塔拉  不用
- I'm so sorry I'm late. - Tara, please.

746
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,510
无需道歉
There's no need to apologize.

747
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,260
我让他们多保留预订15分钟
I had them hold the reservation for 15 minutes,

748
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,480
现在才13分钟  我相信一定没问题的
and it's only been 13 minutes, so I'm sure it'll be fine.

749
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,770
谢谢  路易
Thank you, Louis.

750
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,360
利特预订那桌的客人到齐了
The Litt party is ready.

751
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,590
好极了  有桌子空出来我就安排你们入座
Awesomeness, I'll have a table for you as soon as one's ready.

752
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,940
有桌子空出来
As soon as one's ready?

753
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,840
我让你保留预订15分钟
I asked you to hold our reservation for 15 minutes

754
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,110
现在才过去13分钟  你这个嬉皮士混蛋
and it's only been 13 minutes, you hipster douche bag.

755
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,170
打扰一下  先生  一切都还好吗
Excuse me, sir, is everything okay?

756
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:56,920
不  一切都不好
No, everything is not okay,

757
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,420
这个混蛋把我订的桌子给了别人
this asshole gave away my table.

758
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,480
哥们  没事的  我再给你安排张桌子
Hey, man, it's all good. I'll get you another table.

759
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,350
"哥们"  非常有事
"Hey, man," it's all bad.

760
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,650
我不要其他桌子  我就要我订的那桌
I don't want another table. I want the one I reserved.

761
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,930
所以你为什么不去告诉那些人
So why don't you tell those people that you gave them

762
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,590
你给了他们属于别人的位置
something that belongs to someone else,

763
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,700
因为我是不会跟另一个男人分享
'cause I'm not going to share the most exquisite table

764
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,060
这个星球上最精美的餐桌的
on the planet with another man.

765
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,810
路易
Louis.

766
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,570
这行不通
This isn't gonna work.

767
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,980
路易  路易  跟我说说
Louis--Louis. Please talk to me.

768
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,210
听着  我知道我说过我能接受这事
Look, I know I said I'd be okay with this,

769
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,400
但事实上我并不能接受
but I'm not okay.

770
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,690
因为我联系不到你的时候
Because the whole time I couldn't reach you,

771
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,320
我就会不停的想你是在和他打电话
I kept thinking that you were on the phone with him

772
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,120
和他有说有笑你侬我侬
and laughing with him and loving him.

773
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,510
而只要你还有其他男人
And as long as you have another man,

774
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,320
我就会一直认为你跟他在一起
I'm always gonna think that you're with him,

775
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,060
你在想着他
thinking about him--

776
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,900
-路易  那  -让我说完
- Louis? That's-- - Let me finish.

777
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,010
你是我这辈子见过最吸引我的女人
You are the most riveting woman I've ever met.

778
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,820
我中了你的魔法
You've cast a spell on me.

779
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,080
我永远不会跟你说你该怎么生活
And I would never tell you how to live your life.

780
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,750
但我不会跟其他男人分享你
But I will not share you with another man.

781
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,320
而且我不理解为什么会有任何男人愿意
And I don't understand why any man would.

782
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,180
我想要你  我想要你的全部
I want you, and I want all of you.

783
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,070
-但如果我不能拥有  -路易
- But if I can't have that-- - Louis?

784
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,750
带我回家
Take me home.

785
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,990
来  让我帮你一把
Here, let me help you with that.

786
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,610
-真的吗  -当然
- Oh, would you? - Of course.

787
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,500
红发女孩必须得团结
Us redheads have to stick together.

788
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,280
-谢谢  -别客气  吉尔
- Thank you. - You're welcome, Jill.

789
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,570
你是谁
Who are you?

790
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,900
我是骗你进丹伯里联邦监狱的女人
I'm the woman who tricked you into going to Danbury.

791
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,350
我跟你无话可说
I have nothing to say to you.

792
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,160
请听我说完  我亲自过来就是因为我不想
Please, I came here in person because I don't want to

793
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,190
再骗你一次
trick you again.

794
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,910
那要说什么就赶紧说吧
Then say whatever it is you're here to say.

795
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,540
我来跟你说我父亲的事
I'm here to tell you about my father.

796
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,650
他好几年前被判有罪  在定罪之前
He committed a crime years ago, and before he did,

797
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,240
他试图拉我跟他一起承担后果
he tried to get me to put my toe in the water with him.

798
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,340
我拒绝了  但我当时差点答应了
I said no, but I almost said yes,

799
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,930
因为我爱他
because I loved him.

800
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,330
我知道他是个好人
And I knew he was a good man.

801
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,280
你想让我怎么做
What do you want from me?

802
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,180
就跟我上次想让你做的一样
Same thing that I wanted the last time.

803
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,460
我希望你明天去监狱看你丈夫
I want you to visit your husband in prison tomorrow.

804
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,460
我希望你能放下心结
And I want you to keep an open mind.

805
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
路易  我知道你很有激情
Louis, I knew you were passionate,

806
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,020
但我没想到你这么有激情
but I had no idea how passionate.

807
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,620
简直太魔幻了
That was magic.

808
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,320
我很为我的成果自豪
Yeah, I take pride in my work.

809
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,140
应该的
Well, you should.

810
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,080
既然这样  过十五分钟马上要上演
Well, in that case, there's another show starting

811
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,670
下一场好戏了
in about 15 minutes.

812
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,740
你知道我是什么意思吧
Okay, you know what that means, don't you?

813
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,910
你会累坏的
You're gonna be exhausted,

814
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,950
也就是说你今天要在我家过夜了
which means you're gonna have to spend the night.

815
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,320
那不如白天也不走了
Well, then what do you say we make the whole day of it, too?

816
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,980
你有什么打算
What exactly do you have in mind?

817
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,400
梅特剧院明天有场《塞维利亚的理发师》彩排
There's a dress rehearsal of the "Barber of Seville"

818
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,550
我能弄到资助商席位
at the Met tomorrow and I could get us in as patrons.

819
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,730
路易
Louis...

820
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,780
我十分乐意
I would love to.

821
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:43,370
-威廉  我们得谈谈  -我不是已经来了
- William, we need to talk. - I'm here, just like you asked.

822
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,850
他们起诉了你的女儿
They indicted your daughter.

823
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,670
我知道  她告诉我了
I know. She told me.

824
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,670
我告诉你  你利用她做挡箭牌
And I told you, you were playing a dangerous game

825
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,230
是在玩火
using her to shield you.

826
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,560
吉尔是大姑娘了
Jill's a big girl.

827
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,290
她能照顾好自己
She can take care of herself.

828
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,780
照顾好自己还是照顾好你
Take care of herself, or take care of you?

829
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,240
你是想说我做了什么坏事吗
Are you accusing me of something?

830
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,910
我不是想  我是在告诉你
I'm not accusing you, I'm telling you,

831
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,790
你应该醒一醒了
you need to wake the hell up.

832
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,110
你说什么
What did you just say to me?

833
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,490
你知道吉尔被传讯后卡荷尔准备干什么吗
Do you know what Cahill's gonna do once Jill's arraigned?

834
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,340
不管需要关她多久他就不会手软的
He's gonna sit her down for as long as it takes

835
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,160
直到她接受协议把你供出来
until she cuts a deal to give you up.

836
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,250
她不会这么做的
She would never do that.

837
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,330
你不知道等他们把她关进那间屋子里后
You have no idea what she'll do when they get her

838
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,050
她会做什么
into that room.

839
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,410
我告诉你  如果我的废物女婿
And I'm telling you, if my loser of

840
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,890
都没有屈服  那吉尔肯定也不会
a son-in-law didn't cave, then Jill sure as hell won't.

841
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,000
听我说  该死
Listen to me, goddamn it.

842
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,390
这跟凯文的情况不一样
This isn't gonna be what it was like it was with Kevin.

843
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,240
你想让我怎么样  哈维
What do you want from me, Harvey?

844
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,900
我想让你允许我
I want you to give me authorization

845
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,480
为你们俩提供协议
to cut you both a deal.

846
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,780
你自首  可能只要关上三年
You turn yourself in, you get maybe three years,

847
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,100
而她也不用入狱
and you keep her out.

848
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,730
我为什么要那么做
Why the hell would I do that?

849
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,740
因为如果她供出你  你的刑期
Because if she turns on you, you're gonna be getting

850
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,550
可不止这么点了
a hell of a lot more.

851
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,950
我不会接受的
I'm not cutting a deal.

852
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,550
你以为你这么对待你的女儿
And you think if you're willing to do this

853
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,700
她就不会这么对你吗
to your own daughter, she won't be willing to do it to you?

854
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,640
吉尔还年轻  我已经老了
Jill's a young woman, I'm an old man.

855
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,050
她坐个几年牢根本没什么损失
She does a few years, it hardly makes a dent.

856
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,960
等她出来  还是可以打网球
When she gets out, she can still play tennis

857
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,570
做普拉提之类花我的钱
and go to Pilates and do all the things

858
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,630
玩的玩意儿
I always gave her the money to do.

859
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,700
你早就知道事情会演变成这样
You knew it might come to this, didn't you?

860
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,930
{\an8}萨特供词

861
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,130
我爱我的女儿  哈维
I love my daughter, Harvey,

862
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,060
但没有我  她什么都不是
but she'd be nothing without me.

863
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,290
她也知道她只要替我坐牢
And she knows if she does this for me,

864
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,830
她下半辈子就不用愁了
she'll be taken care of for the rest of her life.

865
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,730
就这样  你不接受
So that's it? No deal?

866
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,270
不接受
No deal.

867
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,820
我很抱歉  吉尔
I'm sorry, Jill.

868
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,750
我要接受协议
I want to cut a deal.

869
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,160
你确定吗
Are you sure?

870
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,670
是的
Yes.

871
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,040
你能帮我吗
Can you do that for me?

872
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,690
不行
No, I can't.

873
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,660
为什么
Why not?

874
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,740
因为他代表你父亲
Because he represents your father.

875
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,910
但我不是
But I don't.

876
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,950
所以我可以
So I can.

877
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,190
塔拉  今天真是不能更棒了
Tara, I didn't think today could get any better,

878
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,590
我不知道你对水压做了什么
but whatever you did to that water pressure

879
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,480
但感觉太好了  我从来没感觉如此焕然一新
is thing of beauty. I haven't felt this fresh

880
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,270
-干干净净  -路易  我要和你谈谈
- and clean since-- - Louis, I have to talk to you.

881
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,550
-怎么了  -约书亚来了电话
- What is it? - Joshua called.

882
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,340
他明天要来城里住两天
He's coming to town tomorrow for two days.

883
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,890
我以为昨晚过后  你们俩
But after last night, I thought it was over

884
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,070
已经结束了
between the two of you?

885
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,050
路易
Louis...

886
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,030
我们在一起很多年  我不能就这么不见他
we've been together for years. I can't just not see him.

887
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,190
你要跟他分手吗
So you're gonna break up with him?

888
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,040
我不知道
I don't know.

889
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,550
欢迎来到丹伯里  肖恩
Welcome to Danbury, Sean.

890
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,130
你现在可是冒着我会被人认出来
You know you're taking a big risk that someone's gonna

891
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,520
并发现你想干什么的风险
recognize me and figure out that you're up to something.

892
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,980
要是我不亲自把这个交给你
Well, I'd be taking an even bigger risk

893
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,020
我面临的风险更大
if I didn't hand this to you personally.

894
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,070
这次你不能取消我的协议了
You're not gonna weasel out of my deal again.

895
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,030
这是什么
What is this?

896
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,300
这是你的办公和吉尔・米勒
That is an iron clad agreement between your office

897
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,230
定下的协议
and Jill Miller.

898
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,620
-你现在代理吉尔・米勒了  -是的
- You're representing Jill Miller now? - Yes, I am.

899
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,840
她知道你不是律师吗
Does she know that you're not a lawyer?

900
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,770
她知道
She does.

901
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,520
她觉得没关系  因为是我
And she's okay with it because I'm also the guy

902
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,160
让她免除了牢狱之灾
who's keeping her out of prison.

903
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,200
我直接把内容告诉你吧
Let me save you the trouble of reading that.

904
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,380
这上面说她愿意指证她的父亲
It says that she's gonna testify against her father,

905
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,320
接受无争辩答辩  获得完全赦免权
pleads no contest, and receives full immunity.

906
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,380
但这上面也说你承认
But it also says that you acknowledge that

907
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,630
是我把她带来找你的
I brought her to you.

908
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,920
那我就拿回办公室再签字吧
Well, then I better bring it to my office and sign it.

909
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,140
不管你在不在意
Oh, and for what it's worth,

910
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,710
我没有试图取消你的协议
I didn't try to weasel out of your deal.

911
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,840
为了让它不被取消我真的尽力了
I did everything I could to keep it in place.

912
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,290
现在它不会被取消了
Well, now it's back in place.

913
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,990
因为我把你需要的东西都给你了
Because I just gave you everything that you need.

914
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,100
不  迈克  你还什么都没给我
No, Mike, you didn't give me everything yet.

915
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,180
因为我还需要把威廉・萨特关进监狱
Because what I still need is William Sutter behind bars.

916
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,660
你干了什么
What the hell did you do?

917
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,900
很高兴见到你  威廉  想喝点什么吗
Nice to see you, William. Can I get you a drink?

918
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,490
你以为我不会发现你录下了我们的谈话
You think I wouldn't find out that you recorded me

919
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,650
然后放给我女儿听了吗
and played it for my daughter?

920
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,780
我没有放给她听
I didn't play it for her.

921
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,590
我放给了我另一名委托人  凯文・米勒
I played it for my other client, Kevin Miller.

922
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,100
只是我在播放的时候吉尔碰巧也在那
Jill just happened to be there when I did.

923
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,560
她现在要告发我了
And now she's turning on me.

924
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,010
那看来她并像你想的那样愿意等五年
Then I guess it turns out she didn't want to wait five years

925
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,950
再去打网球
to play more tennis like you thought.

926
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,340
真该死
Goddamn it,

927
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,850
你违反了律师与当事人的信息披露豁免权
you broke attorney-client privilege.

928
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,810
我没有违反任何条例  威廉
I didn't break anything, William.

929
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,640
因为我刚跟你说完  凯文也是我的委托人
Because like I just told you, Kevin's my client too,

930
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,500
我有义务让他了解实情
and I had an obligation to share the facts with him.

931
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,450
所以你不但不该攻击我  还应该感谢我
So instead of attacking me, you should be thanking me.

932
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,700
因为我去找了卡荷尔并且帮你达成了
Because I went to Cahill and cut you the best deal

933
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,000
你所能得到的最好的交易
you're ever gonna get.

934
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,400
你为什么要这么对我
Why would you do this to me?

935
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,160
这是你自己一手造成的  威廉
You did this to yourself, William.

936
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,450
你让我同时代理你和凯文
You had me represent both you and Kevin,

937
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,160
这意味着我必须在两名委托人间进行选择
which means I had to choose between two clients.

938
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,540
你自己也说过
And you said it, yourself.

939
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,690
你上了年纪  而他们是一对年轻夫妇
You're an old man, and they're a young couple,

940
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,490
所以我选择了他们而没选你
and I chose them over you.

941
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,990
我没让你代理我们两个人
I didn't have you represent us both.

942
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,740
这主意是你想的
It was your idea.

943
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,100
我想好像是的  不是么
I guess it was, wasn't it?

944
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,500
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

945
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,180
你设计坑我
You set me up!

946
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,190
我保证让这件事人尽皆知
And I'm gonna make sure the world knows it.

947
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,570
你可以告诉任何人任何事  威廉
You can tell the world anything you want, William.

948
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,050
但是你没有证据并且即使要讲
But you've got no proof and you'll be telling it

949
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,470
你也只能在牢里讲
from behind bars.

950
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:50,180
总之  我劝你还是签字同意这笔交易
Either way, I suggest you sign this deal,

951
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,330
因为这对你来说已经是最划算的了
'cause it's the best you're ever gonna get.

952
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,530
杰西卡
Jessica.

953
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,860
你怎么来了
What're you doing here?

954
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,730
我昨晚过得很愉快
I had a great time last night.

955
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:16,150
我本来是要给你打电话约你下周再出来 
And I was going to call you about going out again next week

956
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,740
因为我知道你想慢慢来
because I know you want to take it slow.

957
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,210
但随即我明白了你想要慢慢来
But then I found out that you want to take it slow

958
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,500
其实是因为你可能要走了
because you may not be here much longer.

959
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,280
你怎么知道的
How'd you find out?

960
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,280
他们打电话向我征询意见
They called for a reference.

961
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,950
你怎么跟他们说的
And what'd you tell them?

962
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,940
我说能有你是他们的福气
I said them they'd be lucky to have you.

963
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:32,930
谢谢你
Thank you.

964
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,370
你为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

965
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,040
因为我没确定要不要接受
Because I wasn't sure I was gonna take it.

966
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,030
但现在你确定了
But now you are.

967
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,150
杰西卡  如果我认为还有那么一点机会
Jessica, if I thought there would be a chance

968
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,890
你会跟我一起走  我早就问你了
in the world that you would come with me, I would've asked you.

969
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,050
但我们都知道那是不可能的
But we both know that's not gonna happen.

970
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,570
因为你告诉我事情还没结束
Because you told me it's not over yet,

971
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,810
但你的意思是永远不会结束
but what you meant is that it's never gonna be over.

972
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,410
这可是我的事务所  杰夫
It's my firm, Jeff.

973
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,460
这是我耗尽毕生精力所建立起来的
It's the thing I spent my whole life building.

974
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,450
我没有为此指责你
And I'm not judging you for it.

975
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,730
你一直保持真我
You are who you are,

976
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,430
我爱的也正是这样的你
and I love who you are.

977
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,700
我一直想着要重返芝加哥
But I've been thinking about going back to Chicago

978
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,560
虽然再次和你邂逅
for a long time now, and as much as seeing you again

979
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,340
让我很想留下
makes me want to stay here...

980
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,270
但我不得不这么做
This is something I have to do.

981
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,260
就像我说的
Like I said.

982
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,370
有你是他们的福气
They're lucky to have you.

983
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,750
搞定了
It's done.

984
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,000
萨特接受交易
Sutter took the deal.

985
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,410
吉尔安全了
Jill's safe.

986
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:00,810
谢天谢地
Thank God.

987
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,050
我
I'm, uh...

988
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,590
很抱歉让吉尔听到那段录音
I'm sorry that Jill had to hear what she heard.

989
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,280
那是唯一的办法  伙计
It was the only way, man.

990
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,900
再说  你也没说什么
Besides, you didn't say it.

991
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,030
是啊  但在我同意告发你时
No, but I did know what I was doing

992
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,850
我确实知道接下来我要做什么
when I agreed to inform on you.

993
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,360
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

994
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,410
你不该承受这些
You didn't deserve any of that.

995
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,730
你瞧  我们第一次见面时
Hey, look, when we first met,

996
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,940
我就让加洛进来了
I let Gallo in here.

997
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,680
那和你对我做的事一样都是背叛
And that was as much a betrayal as what you did to me.

998
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,310
但你当时并不认识我
Yeah, but you didn't know me.

999
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,860
而我是认识你的
I knew you.

1000
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,100
干嘛  你是想让我恨你吗
What, are you trying to make me hate you?

1001
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,360
不是
No.

1002
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,290
只是我要出狱了而你却不能
It's just that I'm getting out and you're not.

1003
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,360
是的  我没法出去
No, I'm not.

1004
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,190
但你让我妻子免受牢狱之灾
But you kept my wife out of prison,

1005
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,150
在我看来  我们已经扯平了
and as far as I'm concerned, that makes us square.

1006
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,270
谢谢你凯文
Thank you, Kevin.

1007
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,470
你要去哪
Where you going?

1008
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,610
我吗
Me?

1009
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,870
我要给你几分钟享受下
I'm gonna give you a few minutes to enjoy the fact

1010
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,110
你要出狱的喜悦
that you're getting out.

1011
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,930
然后再打个电话告诉瑞秋
And to call Rachel and tell her.

1012
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,760
唐娜  我想到了一个好主意
Donna, I'm on to something.

1013
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,290
我只需要点时间把东西写下来
I just need one second to write it down.

1014
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,550
怎么了  什么事你这么高兴
What is it? What're you so happy about?

1015
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,780
我想我找到能让
I think I just figured out a way

1016
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,900
伦纳德・贝利的案件得以重审的办法了
to get Leonard Bailey's case reopened.

1017
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,190
瑞秋  这太棒了
Rachel, this is amazing.

1018
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,710
来吧  拿上你的东西
Come on, get your things.

1019
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,700
我们可以路上边走边聊
We can talk about it on the way out.

1020
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,620
因为我们要去庆祝一下
Because we're going to celebrate.

1021
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,010
不了  这是好消息  但还不至于要庆祝
No, it's good news, but I'm not ready to celebrate.

1022
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,860
你当然要庆祝
Yes, you are.

1023
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,450
因为我不是在说你的案子
Because I'm not talking about your case.

1024
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,790
瑞秋  哈维和迈克成功了
Rachel, Harvey and Mike did it.

1025
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,250
迈克就要出狱了
Mike's getting out.

1026
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,690
什么
What?

1027
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,080
你听到的没错
You heard me.

1028
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,720
他们成功了
They did it.

1029
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:08,280
萨特要进监狱了  意味着迈克能回家了
Sutter's going away, which means Mike's coming home.

1030
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,120
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

1031
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,910
天哪
