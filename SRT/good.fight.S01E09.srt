最后一刻有什么忠告吗
Any last-minute advice?

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,920
没有
Nope.

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,280
实话实说就好
Just tell the truth.

24
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,710
你在这儿说的话都不能用来控告你
Anything you admit here can't be used against you,

25
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,310
-好好利用这点  -嗯
- so take advantage of that. - Hmm.

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,780
你当律师的第一年就像这样吗
Was your first year anything like this?

27
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,550
不像
No.

28
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,060
但我想我的第四年应该就是这样了
But my guess is my fourth year will be.

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,740
事情变得越来越诡异
Things are getting weirder.

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,520
确实是  不是吗
They are, aren't they?

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,560
这就是现实
It's the world.

32
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,910
你应对得很好
You're weathering it well.

33
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,370
谢谢
Thanks.

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,370
你们可以进来了
You can go in now.

35
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,140
深呼吸  保持微笑
Breathe and smile.

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,190
不是吧
Oh, come on!

37
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,550
我当事人接受的是自愿面谈
I brought my client in for a voluntary interview,

38
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,370
不是小组审讯
not a group interrogation!

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,720
那和你们没关系  我们到里面
That's not for you. We're in here.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,330
进来吧  他们不咬人的
Come on, they won't bite.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,550
让她们过来  伙计们
Let 'em through, guys.

42
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,060
抱歉  走廊正在进行粉刷
Sorry, they're painting in the hallway,

43
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,530
来这里只能通过第六度空间
and, uh, the only way in is through the sixth degree room.

44
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,570
对此深表歉意
So, sorry about that.

45
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,460
你好  我是卢卡·奎恩
Hi, I'm Lucca Quinn.

46
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,960
-你好  -这是我当事人  玛娅·林德尔
- Hi. - This is my client, Maia Rindell.

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,470
我知道  国安局把你们通讯的邮件发过来了
Hi, yeah, I know, the NSA sent over some of your e-mails.

48
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,460
开个玩笑
That's a joke.

49
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,700
我今天特精神
I'm punchy today.

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,650
我是联邦探员马德琳·斯达克
I'm Federal Agent Madeline Starkey.

51
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,070
我们还是坐着聊聊吧
And, uh, why don't we have a seat and chat?

52
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,420
-坐这里  -谢谢
- There you go. - Thank you.

53
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,550
我有点气喘 
I'm out of breath.

54
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,550
玛娅  非常感谢你今天能来
So, Maia, thank you so much for coming today.

55
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,980
我们很感激你能协助这次调查
Um, we really appreciate your help with this investigation,

56
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,270
我知道这对你来说不容易
I know this has not been easy on you.

57
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,230
你知道玛娅来这里是受到联邦检察院
you understand Maia is here under the terms of the proffer

58
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,220
提出的供证协议保护吧
from the U.S. Attorney's Office? 

59
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,640
当然  这是你们的「一日皇后会谈」  没错
Absolutely, this is your Queen for a Day session, yes.

60
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,420
我当事人说的话都不能用来指控她
Nothing my client says can be used against her.

61
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,840
如果她如实作答
If she answers truthfully,

62
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,650
是这样的  我知道你会这么做的
that is correct and I know you will.

63
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,040
因为向联邦探员说谎可是重罪
Because it's a felony to lie to a, um, federal agent.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,060
「美国法典」第18编第1001条
18 usc 1001.

65
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,170
完全正确
Wow, that's exactly right.

66
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,380
所以  那你清楚如果你说谎的话
So, you understand that the proffer

67
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,140
本供证协议就作废
doesn't immunize you from perjury?

68
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,380
-我知道  -那好
- I do. - Great.

69
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,830
好  那我们开始吧
Good. So, here we are.

70
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,260
天呐
Ooh, my gosh!

71
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,090
你看到刚刚那幕了吗
You see what happened there?

72
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,450
当阳光以某种特定方式
As the light hits the window,

73
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,850
洒向窗户时
you know, in a particular way,

74
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,360
小鸟也会跟着撞上去
the birds fly right into it.

75
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,010
真是悲剧
It's sad, really.

76
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,100
如果律师没有异议
Okay, um, I am going to take some notes,

77
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,570
我得做些笔录
if that's all right with counsel?

78
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,460
没问题
Go for it.

79
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,240
玛娅  我们来谈谈你父母
Maia, let's talk about your parents.

80
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,370
这个庞氏骗局因何而起
How did this Ponzi scheme begin?

81
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,290
玛娅不知道这次庞氏骗局的起因
Uh, Maia doesn't know how this Ponzi scheme began.

82
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,120
对  对  是我的错
Oh, right, right. My apologies.

83
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,210
那我表述范围再大些
Um, let me be a little more discursive.

84
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,320
这样来说吧
Let's look at this as:

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,830
和庞氏骗局相关的记忆
Remembrance of Ponzi Schemes Past, huh?

86
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,330
你想起任何关于
And, um, anything that comes into your mind

87
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,020
与你父母或是贾克斯叔叔相关的
about your parents or your Uncle Jackson,

88
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,570
都可以说出来  好吗
you just spill it, okay?

89
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,860
我就坐在这里  把这些记录下来
And I'll just sit here and I'll write it down.

90
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,150
戴安  我需要你
Diane, I need you.

91
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,950
我们接到法院一通电话
We got a call from the courthouse.

92
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,770
又是一桩暴力执法案
Another brutality case.

93
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,670
现在
Now?

94
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,460
猜猜涉案警察是谁
Guess who the cop is?

95
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,850
我猜不到  阿德里安
I'm bad at this, Adrian.

96
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,440
安德鲁·泰鲁
Andrew Theroux.

97
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,270
-你当真吗  -千真万确
- Seriously? - Seriously.

98
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,650
那桩促使我们联盟的案子
The case that brought us together, hmm?

99
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,950
他因过期车标拦下一名摩托车司机
He stops a motorist for expired tags,

100
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,120
踢了他的头
kicks him in the head.

101
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,610
你怎么知道的
How do you know this?

102
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,420
我在县里安插了眼线
I have somebody down at County.

103
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,400
他每向我通报一件暴力执法事件就会拿到300美元
I pay him $300 if he gives me a heads-up on brutality cases.

104
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,650
我们要把这个黑警永远地踢出警局
So we can get this dirty cop off the force once and for all.

105
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,650
-早上好  -早上好
- Good mornin'. - Mornin'.

106
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,210
有什么消息
What do we got?

107
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,380
这是我近期见过的最恶劣事件之一
This is one of the worst I've seen in a while.

108
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,770
有人来看他吗
Anybody else seen him?

109
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,480
家人  律师  有吗
Uh, the family members? Lawyers? Anybody?

110
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,730
没有  泰鲁昨晚才把他弄进来
No. Theroux brought his load in last night.

111
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,990
他归你管
He's all yours.

112
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,240
好
Good.

113
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,220
给我们半个小时
Give us a half-hour with him.

114
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,030
你们是我的律师吗
Are you my lawyers?

115
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,230
但愿如此  您贵姓
We hope to be, Mr...

116
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,400
努特森  托德·努特森

117
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,990
听我说  不是我干的
Look, I didn't do it.

118
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,360
那警察直接对我的车进行了搜查
The cop just searched my car.

119
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,120
什么时候
When was this?

120
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,420
昨晚  大概午夜时分
Last night, about midnight.

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,710
看来他们把你伤口处理得不错
It looks like they, uh, cleaned up your injuries pretty good.

122
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,720
他踢你哪里了
Wh-Where'd he kick you?

123
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,330
我应该说他踢我了吗
Should I say he kicked me?

124
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,950
你是为何被抓进来的  孩子
What are you in for, son?

125
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,550
私藏毒品
Possession.

126
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,860
警卫
Guard!

127
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,420
哪里有抹布
Ugh, where are the Handi Wipes?

128
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,590
我需要普瑞来洗手液
I need my Purell.

129
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,280
简直在虐待我
This is abuse.

130
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,860
天呐
Oh, dear God.

131
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,250
戴安·洛克哈特
Diane Lockhart.

132
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,730
感谢上帝
Ah... Thank God.

133
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,910
艾丽西娅给你打电话了吗
Did Alicia call you?

134
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,960
她说她不能接我的案子
She said she couldn't take my case.

135
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,500
没有  所以你才是暴力执法的受害者
No. So you're the brutality victim?

136
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,690
这是不是糟透了
Isn't it terrible?

137
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,490
我...  看这里
I... Look at this. Hmm? Hmm?

138
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,920
你知道把血渍从埃及棉面料
Do you have any idea how hard it is

139
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,240
清洗掉得有多难
to get blood out of Egyptian cotton?

140
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,510
而且还没有普瑞来
Oh... And now no Purell.

141
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,760
我载着奈芙塔莉
I was driving down 290

142
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,000
凌晨两点驱车行驶在290公路上
around 2:00 in the morning with Naftali.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,730
-她是谁  -一个朋友

极具冒险精神  以色列人
Adventurous. Israeli.

145
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,630
她父亲以前是将军
Her father was a general.

146
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,080
千万别和她提「六日战争」
Don't get her started on the Six-Day War.

147
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,080
{\an8}第三次中东战争  以色列方面称六日战争

148
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,300
她就喜欢看我受苦
She loves seeing me in pain.

149
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,080
你脸上的淤伤
The bruises on your face.

150
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,160
我们怎么知道不是奈芙塔莉弄的
How do we know those aren't from Naftali?

151
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,470
不  奈芙塔莉绝不会对我的脸动手
No. Naftali knows never to hit me in the face, 

152
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,070
只有背部和大腿
only the back and the thighs.

153
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,780
所以你背部和大腿都有淤伤吗
So you have bruises on your back and your thighs?

154
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,050
很轻的淤伤
Mmm, slight bruises.

155
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,800
大部分是些抓痕
Mostly scratches.

156
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,360
那女人单凭一根回形针就能让人欲仙欲死
What that woman can do with the end of a paper clip...

157
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,510
我知道  我不是一名好的目击者
I know. I'm not a good witness.

158
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,000
和她谈谈...  奈芙塔莉·阿马多
Talk to her... Naftali Amado.

159
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,080
-她和我的口径肯定一致  -好
- She'll say exactly what I said. - Okay.

160
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,770
他们逮捕我的方式
They're out to get me.

161
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,430
和对待罗德尼·金是如出一辙
The same way they did with Rodney King.

162
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,030
{\an8}罗德尼·金：警方暴力执法的受害者  法院判决四名白人警察无罪
从而引发1992年洛杉矶暴动

163
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,980
我们有很多的共同点  他和我
We've got a lot in common, he and I.

164
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,690
我们怎么就不能和平相处呢
Can't we all just get along?

165
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,580
你怎么看
What do you think?

166
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,230
他就是个恶魔
Oh, he's the devil.

167
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,260
不幸的是  这个恶魔是我们将泰鲁
And unfortunately, the devil is our best chance

168
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,060
踢出警局的最好机会
to get Theroux kicked off the force.

169
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,050
我不知道从哪儿说起
I'm not sure how to start.

170
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,740
那不然这样吧
Well, here, let-let's try this.

171
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,890
根据法务会计的报告
From our forensic accounting,

172
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,640
首次出现犯罪行为
the first criminal act...

173
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,180
也即第一次使用新入资金来偿还原先债务
the first one where new funds were used to pay off old debts...

174
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,570
时间是2008年9月15日
was September 15, 2008.

175
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,620
想起什么了吗
Any thoughts?

176
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,460
这过去太久了
That was a long time ago.

177
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,830
2008年吗
Um, 2008?

178
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,380
我那时17岁
I would have been 17.

179
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,220
你记得那天你在做什么吗
And do you remember what you were doing that day?

180
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,840
我大概在学校
I was probably in school.

181
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,070
好吧  那天雷曼兄弟破产了
Okay. Well, it was the day Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

182
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,090
这能帮你回忆起什么吗
Does that help?

183
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,560
突发新闻  全球股票进入暴跌状态
Breaking news. Stocks all around the globe are in a freefall at this point,

184
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,400
-危机产生于...  -我的天呐
- because of the crisis of... - Holy God.

185
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,100
道琼斯工业指数预计会下降300点
The Dow expected to open down over 300 points,

186
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,290
-恐慌的产生... -天呐  什么
- as fears of... - Uh, God... What?

187
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,250
不管能想起什么都行
Anything you remember could help.

188
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,280
如果你记不清  直说记不清就好
If you're not sure of a memory, just say you're not sure.

189
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,250
{\an8}突发新闻  雷曼兄弟已穷途末路

190
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,440
天呐  我们要怎么解释啊
Oh, God. What...uh, uh, what are we gonna say?

191
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,470
-我要怎么办啊  -别慌  别这样
- What am I gonna do? - Stop. Stop it!

192
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,700
我们得联系贾克斯
We just have to get Jax.

193
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,820
我一整天都在打电话
I-I've been all day making calls...

194
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,640
玛娅  你记得这个名字吗
Maia, do you recognize this name?

195
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,630
迈克尔·汉尼根
Michael Hannigan.

196
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,960
他是你父母基金的一位投资人
He was an investor in your parent's fund.

197
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,570
-记得  -他9月15日那天在你家吗
- Yes. - And he was at your house on September 15?

198
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,200
-没错  -好的
- Yes. - Okay.

199
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,540
你父母和他说话了吗
And your parents spoke with him?

200
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,860
是的
Yes.

201
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,620
贾克斯也在
Jax was there, too.

202
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,580
我叔叔贾克斯也在  他们聊了会儿
Um, my Uncle Jax, he was there and-and spoke to him.

203
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,340
是和汉尼根吗  你确定吗
To Hannigan? You're sure?

204
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,110
这只是暂时的  迈克尔
This is temporary, Mike.

205
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,480
你现在撤回投资  就损失了八百万...
You pull your money out now, you're out eight mil...

206
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,840
我确定
Yes.

207
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,340
我妈妈  她给贾克斯打了电话
My mom, she, uh, uh, she called Jax

208
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,700
他过来告诉迈克尔·汉尼根
and he came over to tell Mike Hannigan that

209
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,580
如果他现在从基金里撤回投资
if he pulled his money from the Fund,

210
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,300
他就可能会损失八百万
then he would be out something like $8 million.

211
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,140
最好别把钱提出来
And the best course was to keep his money in.

212
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,380
贾克斯是什么时候过来的
And what time did Jax come by?

213
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,840
我那时还在做作业
I was still doing my homework.

214
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,380
所以...
Uh, so...

215
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,910
大约是下午四点左右
probably about 4:00 in the afternoon.

216
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,050
好的  他呆了多久
Okay. And how long was he there?

217
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,220
我想大概是两小时
I think two hours.

218
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,280
因为他  他晚饭前就走了
Because he was... he was gone before dinner.

219
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,030
你和你父母一起吃的晚饭吗
And you had dinner with your parents?

220
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,630
你不能永远保证说有12%的收益
You can't always be promising 12%.

221
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,440
这和我们保证多少没关系
Well, it's not about what we prom...

222
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,030
是的
Yes.

223
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,550
好的  现在问题是这样的  玛娅
Good. Now, here's the problem, Maia.

224
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,110
我有你母亲的电子日历  然后
I have your mother's computer calendar, and, uh...

225
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,900
抱歉  我还是有些卢德主义
If you'll pardon me, I'm still a bit of a Luddite.

226
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,900
{\an8}卢德主义  指对新技术和新事物的一种盲目冲动反抗

227
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,020
我得把它们打印出来
I need it printed out, and, uh...

228
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,030
"卢德"  我真讨厌这个词  你呢
"Luddite," God, I hate that word, don't you?

229
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,380
我对此没什么看法
I don't think I have an opinion.

230
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,300
就像"模因"一样  就是这些词
It's like "Meme." It's one of those words

231
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,300
{\an8}通过模仿传递行为或思想

232
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,900
让英语显得这么丑陋
that makes the English language so ugly.

233
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,580
-说日历  -好的  你母亲在这天
- The calendar. - Yes. So on this day, your mother

234
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,610
记录说你在下午三点约了妇科医生
says you had a gynecologist appointment at 3:00 p.m.,

235
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,060
和一个叫雷吉娜医生
uh, with a Dr. Regina.

236
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,690
那么问题来了
So here's the problem,

237
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,180
我不知道你是怎么看到
I'm not sure how you could have seen

238
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,510
你叔叔贾克斯在下午四点到你家的
your Uncle Jax at your house at 4:00 p.m.

239
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,820
因为你在下午三点约了医生
when you were at a doctor's appointment at 3:00 p.m.

240
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,050
容我打断一下  你问的可是九年前的事
Excuse me, you're asking about something that happened nine years ago.

241
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,550
我知道  听着  我是站在你这边的
Oh, I know. Look, I'm on your side in this.

242
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,230
我知道记忆可能会有偏差
I know that memory can be faulty.

243
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,020
我只是试图找到真相而已
I'm just trying to get to the truth.

244
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,220
玛娅
Maia.

245
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,800
你有去医生那儿吗
Were you there at the doctor's appointment?

246
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,800
去了
I was.

247
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,610
可能我是后来才看到贾克斯和汉尼根先生的
Uh, maybe I-I saw Jax and Mr. Hannigan later.

248
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,740
或许是另一天的事
Or another day, maybe?

249
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,320
不  我不这么认为
No. No, I don't think so.

250
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,130
-就在那天  -那问题来了
- It... it was on that day. - Well, here's the problem.

251
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,120
雷吉娜医生的办公室
The distance between Dr. Regina's office

252
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,590
和你家的距离是12.4英里
and your house is 12.4 miles,

253
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,850
那天路上还特别的堵
and it was very, very heavy traffic that day.

254
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,720
你是怎么知道的
How do we know that?

255
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,280
我联调局的属下们  他们无所不知
My minions, my FBI minions. They know everything.

256
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,840
还给了我打印稿
And they give me hard copies.

257
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,600
那么你和你母亲回家的时候
So by the time you would get home with your mother

258
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,000
就已经五点半了
it would have been 5:30.

259
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,730
你管家也说她是五点半给你端上的晚餐
And your housekeeper said she served you dinner right at 5:30.

260
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,440
贾克斯怎么说的
What did Jax say?

261
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,210
贾克斯说他那天从没去过你家
Jax... says he was never at your house at all.

262
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,880
他在说谎  他去了
That is not true. He was there.

263
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,110
但你记不清时间
But you can't remember when.

264
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,010
是的  但我...
No. No, but I...

265
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,750
我记得他在那儿
I remember that he was there.

266
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,750
大概在我八岁的时候
You know, when I was, uh, about eight,

267
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,580
我去看了「波索马戏团」
I was on Bozo's Circus.

268
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,580
{\an8}儿童节目

269
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,900
你那时还没到记事的年纪
And, uh... you're too young to remember this...

270
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,130
但那时可是很出名的节目
but it was a really big deal.

271
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,090
我和妈妈坐在观众席里
I was sitting in the audience with my mom,

272
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,260
我被抽中玩特等奖游戏
and I was chosen for the grand prize game,

273
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,160
这更是大事件了
which is another very big deal.

274
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,720
我记得我把球投中了六号框
And I remember as I got that ball into bucket number six,

275
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,330
到处都是彩屑
and the confetti was all over the place,

276
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,400
观众在欢呼
the crowd was roaring.

277
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,880
而到去年
And last year

278
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,070
我妈妈给我看了那天的照片
my mother showed me some pictures from that day.

279
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,720
我没去看「波索马戏团」
I wasn't on the Bozo show.

280
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,520
是我姐姐去了
My older sister was.

281
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,610
你看  人的思维很奇异
See, the mind has an odd way of turning

282
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,470
能把美好想象变成真实记忆
wishful thinking into actual memories.

283
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,800
好吧
Okay...

284
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,780
我觉得我们得暂停一会儿
I think we should take a pause there.

285
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,360
我得和我的当事人商量下
I want to confer with my client.

286
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,740
没问题  请便  请记住
Oh, absolutely. Please. And remember,

287
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,310
这是一日皇后会谈
this is Queen for a Day,

288
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,600
问的问题都没有任何陷阱
so no gotcha questions here.

289
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,030
走那边  走那边
Go around, go around!

290
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,980
油漆工在忙  抱歉
Painters. Sorry.

291
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,860
从那扇门出去
Uh, just go out that door.

292
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,900
你们来的那扇门
Door you came.

293
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,260
抱歉  我们只是...
Uh, sorry. We're just, uh...

294
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,180
那边油漆工不让过  所以...
There's just painters, so...

295
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,730
好了  我的建议是
Okay, here's my advice.

296
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,020
她不是你朋友  她想揪到你的谎言
She is not your friend. She's trying to catch you in lies.

297
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,550
-我没撒谎  -我明白的
- I'm not lying. - I understand.

298
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,430
我知道你想保护你父母
I know you're trying to protect your parents,

299
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,300
但她知道你在试图这样做
but she can see you're doing that.

300
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,430
所以别说贾克斯和汉尼根碰面的事
So don't talk about Jax being with Hannigan

301
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,760
除非你清楚记得是那样
unless you have a specific memory.

302
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,460
我不想害我爸爸
I don't want to hurt my dad.

303
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,130
我明白
I know.

304
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,050
但供证协议的前提是你会说实话
But your proffer only covers you if you don't lie.

305
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,830
如果你为了保护父亲撒谎  他可能会脱罪
If you lie to protect your dad, you might get him off,

306
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,570
但你会进监狱
but you'll end up in jail.

307
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,630
全体起立
All rise.

308
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,750
有请尊敬的法官唐·林登
The Honorable Don Linden presiding.

309
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,890
不  史蒂夫  我能自己来

斯威尼先生又来了  这真是太好了
Mr. Sweeney, how nice of you to join us again.

314

我是无辜的  法官阁下
I am innocent man, Your Honor.

315
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,530
法官阁下
Your Honor,

316
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,200
我们的当事人和这个社区有着很深的渊源
our client has very deep roots in his community...

317
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,300
在奥黑尔机场还有私人飞机
And a private jet on standby at O'Hare.

318
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,020
什么指控
Okay, what is the charge?

319
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,240

322
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,430
等等  什么
Wait, what?

323
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,190
法官阁下  这是轻罪
Your Honor, this is a misdemeanor.

324
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,200
不  重罪
No, a felony.

325
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,880
斯威尼先生殴打警官
Now, Mr. Sweeney struck out at the officer,

326
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,190
重击其头部和面部
striking him in the head and face.

327
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,960
这简直是令人作呕的过度指控
This is gross overcharging.

328
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,190
-众生平等  -别卖乖  先生
- All lives matter. - Don't get cute, sir.

329
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,610
闭嘴  科林  我好不容易站在你这边的
Shut up, Colin. I'm finally on your side.

330
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,950
法官阁下  我们请求
Your Honor, we ask that

331
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,690
在斯威尼先生本人担保下将其释放
Mr. Sweeney be released on his own recognizance.

332
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,340
他是过分控告的受害者
He's a victim of overzealous prosecution.

333
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,420
他被人当成靶子了  法官阁下
He all but has a target on his back, Your Honor.

334
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,340
是吗  我想知道为什么
Oh, gee, I wonder why.

335
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,250
保释金定为三百万美元
Bail is set at three million dollars.

336
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,440

1971年9月9日至13日阿提卡监狱曾发生犯人暴动  死43人

339
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,620
你在笑  为什么
You're smiling. Why?

340
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,810
对警官严重伤害的重罪
Felony aggravated battery against a police officer.

341
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,240
我们可以让泰鲁上证人席吗
We can put Theroux on the stand?

342
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,240
当然
Yup.

343
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,370
如果他们指控轻罪的话  我们就不能
If they kept it a misdemeanor, we couldn't.

344
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,690
科林·斯威尼终于要做件好事了
So Colin Sweeney is gonna do his one good deed:

345
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,630
把坏条子从警察队伍中踢出去
get a dirty cop kicked off the force.

346
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,070
是的  你们错过了一整个鸟群
Yup, you missed an entire flock.

347
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,610
你们两个把要解决的事情都解决好了吗
Did you two get everything settled?

348
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,930
没什么要解决的
There was nothing to settle.

349
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,060
但是我们谈了谈  然后我们回来了
But we talked. And we're back.

350
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,460
好  很好  很好
Good. Good, good, good.

351
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,380
玛娅  我想让你看看你母亲的行程表
So, Maia, I want you to take a look at your mother's calendar, okay?

352
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,590
你会看到
I think you'll see that

353
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,870
列出了过去的几年里你们两人的会面
you two have a few appointments listed over the years, 

354
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,050
而且不止是妇科检查  看到了吗

355
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,630
比如  10月3日那天你有另一个约会
For example, on October 3 you had another appointment

356
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,530
跟雷吉娜医生  还有

357
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
{\an8}2008年10月

358
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,670
然后  10月23日
then, on October 23

359
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,710
你陪你母亲一起去检查了牙齿

362
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,590
你还记得看的是什么吗
Do you remember what you saw?

363
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,790
-不记得  -你好好看一下
- No. - Yeah, well, why don't you take a good look at that and,

364
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,360
在你记得的那些旁边打个勾
put a check mark next to the ones that you remember.

365
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,760
我担心的不是性病
Well, the worry is not STD...

366
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,020
{\an8}2008年10月
3日 玛娅的妇科检查  下午三点
雷吉娜医生

367
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,850

{\an8}19日
玛娅的妇科检查

瑞吉娜医生

369
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,500
医生  我能做些什么呢
What can I do to help, doct...

370
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:25,820
{\an8}17日
玛娅妇科检查
下午三点半
雷吉娜医生

371
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,320
谢谢
Thank you. 

372
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,650
所以这几次你都跟你妈在一起
So you and your mom were together at these times?

373
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,580
是的
Yes.

374
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,510
我记得是这样的
As far as I remember, yes.

375
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,380
好的
Okay. 

376
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,500
有个问题
Well, here's the problem...

377
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,310
如果有问题的时候
It would be easier if you would just

378
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,180
你提前告诉我们会好一些
tell us a problem before there is a problem.

379
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,150
你母亲这几次并没有跟你在一起
Your mother wasn't with you at these appointments.

380
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,090
你什么意思
What do you mean? 

381
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,510
那是她开溜跟你叔叔贾克斯滚床单的日子
That's when she was off sleeping with your Uncle Jax.

382
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,900
她在行程表上把这些预约当做借口
She used as an excuse these appointments in her calendar

383
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,760
这样她就能跟你叔叔贾克斯在他家约会了
so she could meet with your Uncle Jax at his home.

384
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,100
玛娅根本没有可能知道的
Maia had no way to know that. 

385
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,710
是的  就是因为她母亲写进行程表里的
Yes, but just because her mother has it in her calendar

386
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,780
并不一定就是真的
doesn't mean it's true.

387
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,570
如果不是事实的话
And Maia shouldn't confirm it

388
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,870
玛娅就不应该确认
if it's not true.

389
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,350
其中的一些日期是真的
Some of those dates are true.

390
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,200
没有一个是真的  玛娅
None of these dates are true, Maia.

391
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,030
每两周
Every two weeks,

392
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,260
你母亲都会和你叔叔贾克斯在他家约会
your mother met with your Uncle Jax at his home.

393
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,910
从2008年开始
Since 2008.

394
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,920
有没有可能你母亲跟你叔叔联手
Is it possible that your mother is working

395
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,460
陷害你的父亲呢
with your Uncle Jax to set up your Dad?

396
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,730
我的当事人无法回答
My client cannot answer that. 

397
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,650
这就是问题  玛娅
'Cause here's the problem, Maia.

398
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,650
这几年来
You were used as a cover

399
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,580
你都被你母亲当做跟你叔叔鬼混的借口
so your mother could sleep with your uncle for several years.

400
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,250
而你从未起过任何疑心
And you didn't suspect anything?

401
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,230
-没有  -好的
- No. - Okay. 

402
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,020
与此同时
And in that same time frame,

403
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,830
你怀疑过你父母的庞氏骗局吗
did you ever suspect your parents of their Ponzi scheme?

404
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,880
我觉得我们这会儿应该午休一下
I think we should take a break for lunch at this point.

405
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,900
-我想继续问几个小时  -不行
- I'd like to go for a few more hours. - No.

406
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,150
我们休息一下
Let's take a break.

407
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,810
好吧  如果你们执意如此
Sure. If you insist.

408
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,290
{\an8}上午11点16分

409
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,630
纳特  你应该去补补觉
Nat, you need to get some sleep.

410
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,170
是啊  你以为我在干什么
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing?

411
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,690
我们又有一个被警察暴力执法的当事人了
We have another client who was brutalized by a cop.

412
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,160
你们知道我是给平民警察问责办公室工作的
You do know I work for COPA,

413
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,450
-而不是给你们卖命的  -平民警察问责办公室
- not for you? - Civilian Office of Police Accountability.

414
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,290
就怕你没意识到  我们就是平民
Just in case you haven't noticed, we are civilians.

415
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,160
你们不是平民  你们是寄生虫
You're not civilians, you're parasites.

416
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,980
纳特  当时在例行交通管制期间
It was during a routine traffic stop, Nat.

417
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,710
你最好还是拿笔记下来
You'll want to write this down.

418
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,410
你猜警察是谁
Guess who the cop is?

419
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,520
安德鲁·泰鲁
Andrew Theroux.

420
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,240
什么时候的事
And when-when was this?

421
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,090
昨晚
Last night.

422
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,230
-你们要起诉吗  -是的
- You're bringing a suit? - Yup.

423
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,260
-再告六百万  -受害者是谁
- Another six million. - Who's the victim?

424
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,440
每个市民都享有同等的受法律保护的权利吧
All right, every citizen deserves equal protection under the law.

425
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,780
-受害者是谁  -给他个机会
- Who's the victim? - Give him a chance.

426
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,720
-他并没做错什么  -阿德里安
- He hasn't done anything wrong. - Adrian.

427
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,790
科林·斯威尼
Colin Sweeney.

428
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,760
好吧  好吧
All right. Okay, okay.

429
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
这些警察一直跟着人家屁股后面
The cops have been following this guy around,

430
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,160
想找借口报复
looking for some kind of payback.

431
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,410
他把他拽出车外
He dragged him out of the car

432
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,330
踢了他的头
and kicked him in the head. 

433
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,090
平民警察问责办公室得调查
COPA has to investigate.

434
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,630
在这事上科林·斯威尼不是重点
Now, you know it's not about Sweeney,

435
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,710
关键是要把这混蛋踢出去警队  来吧
it's about getting this piece of shit off the force. Come on.

436
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,310
来上庭  我们让泰鲁上证人席
Come to court. We're gonna put Theroux on the stand. -

437
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,370
我就是不想要有成见
All I want is an open mind.

438
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,150
来吧
Come on.

439
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,020
是内务部吗  是平民警察问责办公室
That was Internal Affairs? That was COPA.

440
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,990
而且他们不会调查的
And they're not gonna investigate.

441
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,300
在证人席上把泰鲁问垮
Destroy Theroux on the stand.

442
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,650
他会回来的
He'll be back.

443
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,730
一开始他情绪激动  后来他就开始动手了
At first he was agitated, then he got belligerent.

444
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,210
在我看来他像是嗑药了
It seemed to me that he was on drugs.

445
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,400
我都二十年没嗑过药了
I haven't used drugs in 20 years.

446
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,470
小点声嘀咕  斯威尼先生
Whisper quieter, Mr. Sweeney. 

447
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,190
-我在这都能听见  -对不起法官阁下
- I can hear you up here. - Sorry, Your Honor.

448
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,830
我估计昨晚警官打我的时候
I think my eardrum is damaged

449
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,450
我的耳膜可能受损了
from when the officer hit me last night.

450
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,040
反对  法官阁下
Objection, Your Honor.

451
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,010
反对有效  闭嘴  斯威尼先生
Sustained. Shut up, Mr. Sweeney.

对于他的反抗  你是如何反应的呢  警官

我尽量只用必要的力量
I tried to use only as much force as was necessary

454
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,880
使他屈服
to gain his compliance.

不幸的是  他攻击我

还有我嘴里的伤口
Also cuts inside my mouth

461
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,150
我的医生认为我需要进行一些矫正手术

462
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,860
来重新排齐我的牙齿

463

我都没想到过要说这个  但是我认为
I never thought I'd say this, but I think there's a chance

466
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,440
科林·斯威尼有可能说的是实话

476
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,030
你老公叫什么名字

你没有结婚

481
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,030
被你发现了
You got me.

482

你还协助定了

这样示好对他们也起作用了吗
Did the folksy thing work on them, too?

486
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,170
以前有一位律师  我负责案子的律师...
Well, there was one lawyer, uh, in one of the cases...

487
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,660
我不会指名道姓
and I'm not gonna say who...

488
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,570
我们对他的客户没有兴趣
we weren't interested in his client.

489
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,280
我们只要求他前来做一次惯例询问
We only asked him to come in for a how-do-you-do meeting.

490
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,360
但这位律师非常咄咄逼人
but this lawyer was so aggressive

491
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,300
疑心很重  于是我们就决定
and so suspicious that we decided

492
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,100
进一步调查他的客户
to probe further into his client.

493
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,560
而现在他的客户进了监狱
And that client is now in prison.

494
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,420
-很好的故事  -真人真事

495
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,760
你是在建议我  不要代表我的客户吗
Are you advising me - not to represent my client? 

496
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,050
我完全没有这个意思
Oh, far from it.

497
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,340
我觉得如果玛娅能说出她知道的所有事情
I think it would benefit both of us

498
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,110
对我们都有利
if Maia were to offer all she knows.

499
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,950
毫无保留
Undiluted.

500
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,250
你想知道什么  斯达克女士

是的
Uh, yes.

505
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,850
你...
And you...

506
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,870
上一次董事会是什么时候
When was the last time the board met?

507
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,530
我不知道
I don't know.

508
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,610
几年前吧
a few years ago?

509
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,580
如果你已经知道了请直接告诉她
If you have the answer you can just tell her.

510
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,450
我觉得最后一次董事会
I think the last board meeting

511
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,860
也是仅有的一次董事会
and only board meeting

512
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,550
是在2011年6月18日
was June 18, 2011.

513
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,680
据你所知在其它时间还开过董事会吗
Do you know of any other dates? Any more meetings?

514
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,520
-没有了  -好吧  你不觉得奇怪吗
- No. - Okay. That doesn't bother you?

515
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,730
-请告诉我你是什么意思  -这个基金
- Tell me what you mean. - Well, it's a foundation

516
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,960
资产达到了6500万美元...
with $65 million in assets...

517
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,090
而你们只开过一次会
and you only met once?

518
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,390
建立这个基金并不是我的意思
Well, the foundation wasn't my idea.

519
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,020
-是...  -是你父母的主意  是的
- It was... It was your parents, yeah.

520
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,260
是的  而且是做善事的
Yes, but it was for a good cause.

521
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,490
为了非洲的疟疾预防
For malaria prevention in Africa.

522
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,840
那你们在预防疟疾上投入了多少资金
Oh, and how much did you spend on prevention?

523
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,570
是的  但是...
Yeah, but...

524
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,690
我就是想知道我们给他们送了多少钱
I just want to know how much we're sending.

525
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,460
亲爱的  你知道  挺多钱的  亲爱的
Honey. You know, it's a lot, uh, honey.

526
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,330
我们不会克扣的
I mean, we're not skimping.

527
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,450
-我不知道  -没关系  玛娅
- I don't know. - Oh, well, that's okay, Maia.

528
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,660
你只是有名无实  这不是件坏事
You were a figurehead. That's not a bad thing.

529
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,930
你不会有麻烦的
You're not in trouble.

530
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,030
但是爸  基金有我的名字
Yeah, but Dad, I mean, it's got my name on it.

531
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,030
我有权知道
I have to know.

532
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,130
好吧  我让贾克斯把账目给你看
Okay, I'll-I'll have Jax open the books to you.

533
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,600
给我们几个星期时间
Just give us a few weeks.

534
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,800
-好吧  -好吧
- Okay. - Okay.

535
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,540
你需要休息一会儿吗
Do you need a moment?

536
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,650
不用了
No.

537
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,910
那我们就来谈谈基金成立的日期吧
So let's talk about the day the foundation was formed.

538
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,880
-搞到了吗  -就是这个

你之前也在这里
This is a familiar spot for you...

545
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,430
接受了关于警察施暴案的询问
being questioned about police brutality.

546
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,610
反对  诱导性问题  非常无理
Objection. Argumentative. And rude.

547
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,160
第一项反对有效
Sustained to the first.

548
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,790
第二项反对无效
Overruled to the second.

549
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,950
警官  你是在萨沃伊健身馆锻炼吗
Officer, do you work out at Savoy's Gym?

550
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,810
是的  怎么了
Yes, why?

551
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,850
你记得昨天下午曾与一位名叫

00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,300
赫克托·佩拉萨的19岁的

553
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,740
次中量级拳击手过招吗
named Hector Peraza

554
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,670
根据一位目击证人的证词
who, according to eyewitnesses,

555
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,400
-他曾打败过你  -胡说八道...
- knocked you out? - That's bullshit...

556
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,470
他没打败我
he didn't knock me out.

557
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,800
抱歉  但你与他打过拳击吗
My apologies. But you sparred with him?

558
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,000
是的  我坚持到了最后
Yeah, I held my own. 

559
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,180
这是在你值班之前的事吗
And this was before - you went on duty?

560
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,430
是的  怎么了
Yes. Why?

561
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:43,140
那有没有可能  你脸上的淤青
Well, isn't it possible that these bruises here are the result

562
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,500
是由赫克托·佩拉萨造成的
of punches thrown by Hector Peraza?

563
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,580
-不是  -好吧  这些的你嘴巴内部的
- No. - Well, these are photos

564
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,420
切割和撕裂伤口的照片
of cuts and lacerations inside your mouth,

565
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,710
-泰鲁警官  -反对  不在证据列表中
- Officer Theroux. - Objection. Not in evidence.

566
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,860
这些是警方的照片  法官阁下
These are police photos, Your Honor.

567
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,480
不是我们拍的
We didn't take them.

568
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,980
除非你想把你们所有的照片都剔除出去 
Unless you want to throw out all your photos, 

569
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,100
助理检察官先生  反对无效
Mr. ASA, overruled. 

570
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:04,350
你看见这些伤口了吗  泰鲁警官
Do you see these lacerations, Officer Theroux?

571
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,740
这些撕裂伤和这东西的形状相符
Those lacerations are in the same shape as this.

572
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,680
萨沃伊健身馆的护口器
The mouth guard at Savoy's Gym.

573
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,170
你们太厉害了
You guys are good.

574
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:31,460
*祝你生日快乐*
*Happy birthday to you*

575
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,560
{\an8}*祝你生日快乐...*
*Happy birthday to you...*

576
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,170
是你18岁的生日吗
So this was your 18th birthday?

577
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,670
是的
Yes.

578
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,530
你父母就是在那个时候将林德尔基金送给你的
And that's when your parents gifted you the Rindell Foundation?

579
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,170
是的
Yes.

580
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,720
{\an8}林德尔基金

581
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,030
我爸妈  他们知道我对非洲很感兴趣
My parents, they-they knew I was interested in Africa.

582
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,460
我听说疟疾一年能夺去一百万个孩子的生命
I had read that malaria kills one million kids a year

583
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,940
而蚊帐就能阻止这种疾病蔓延
and that it could be prevented with mosquito netting.

584
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,790
所以他们想我为资助非洲百分之六十的孩子
So they wanted me to run an effort to pay for the netting

585
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,970
买蚊帐出一份力
for 60% of African children.

586
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,610
确实目的很崇高
Well, that is a good cause,

587
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,130
非常感谢你的善举
and thank you so much for doing that.

588
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,340
我能问一下还有谁参加了那场聚会吗
Can I ask you who else was at your party?

589
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,730
很多人
A lot of people.

590
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,520
你的女朋友呢  艾米·布雷斯林
How 'bout your girlfriend, uh, Amy Breslin?

591
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,440
是的  她也在
Yes, she was there.

592
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,240
但她当时不是我的女朋友
But she wasn't my girlfriend at the time.

593
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,350
是贾克斯叔叔介绍我们认识的
Uncle Jax introduced us.

594
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,450
她当时刚进法学院
She was just entering law school.

595
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,620
你男朋友也在吗
And your boyfriend was there, too?

596
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,010
我得回去了
I have to get back.

597
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,430
玛娅  他在场吗
Maia, was he there?

598
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,840
-是的  -好的
- Yes. - Okay.

599
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,350
并没有很复杂
Well, that's not complicated.

600
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,370
好吧
Okay.

601
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,210
还有戴安·洛哈特  她在吗
And Diane Lockhart, was she there?

602
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,180
是的  她也在
Yes, she was there, too.

603
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,460
你确定不想来一块吗  很好吃的
You sure you don't want one? They're delicious.

604
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,740
你老公送的吗
From your husband?

605
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,640
好吧
Okay.

606
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,790
现在你听见过洛哈特女士有给你的父母
Now, did you hear Ms. Lockhart offer any legal advice

607
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,990
任何法律建议吗
to your parents?

608
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,200
好了  我要你就此打住
Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there.

609
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,770
这些内容不在供证协议的范围中
This is not material covered by the proffer. 

610
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,990
所有与庞氏骗局有关的事情
Well, anything that has to do with the Ponzi scheme

611
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,950
都涵盖在了这份供证协议中
is covered by the proffer.

612
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,160
受到律师与当事人的保密特权保护的
Hearsay conversations which, in fact, 

613
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,220
传闻证据对话内容  不能...
may be subject to attorney-client privilege are not...

614
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,910
我现在手头的案子是个谋杀案
Actually, my current case is a homicide.

615
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,520
我的客户被指控杀死了一位
My client is accused of killing a mutual fund manager

616
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,360
与伯尼·麦道夫共事的互惠基金经理
who worked with Bernie Madoff.

617
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,460
真的假的
Really?

618
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,100
你认识他吗
Do you know him?

619
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,760
伯尼  不认识
Bernie? No.

620
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,360
我们认识他吗  丽诺
Do we, Lenore?

621
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,800
也许贾克斯认识吧  我不知道
Maybe Jax... I don't know.

622
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,560
我想问的只是她有没有印象  如果她没有
All I'm asking is if she has a memory. If she doesn't,

623
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,180
-我们可以继续  -我想说的不是这个
- we can move on... - That's not what I'm saying...

624
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,900
我得回去了
I have to get back.

625
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,590
-打电话给我  -等等
- Call me. - Wait, wait, wait.

626
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,450
我想说的只是如果她有印象
All I'm saying is if she has a memory,

627
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,290
{\an8}你这是在进行钓鱼式盘问
This is a fishing expedition on your part.

628
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,960
-我会听的  不然我们  -你在刨根问底
- I will hear it, or we'll... - You are digging.

629
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,610
-不不不  -丽诺  你觉得露丝·麦道夫
- No, no, no, no... - Lenore, do you think that Ruth Madoff knew

630
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,980
知道她丈夫在做什么吗
what her husband was doing?

631
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,100
我觉得不知道  为什么这么问
No. Why? 

632
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,380
是这样的  我觉得她不知道是因为她不想知道
See, I think she didn't know because she didn't want to know.

633
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,250
是啊
Yeah.

634
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,510
她怎么会不知道呢
How could she not know?

635
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,030
-我会听的  不然我们  -你在刨根问底
- ...I will hear it, or we'll... - You are digging.

636
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,830
不不不不  打住  等一下
No, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Just a sec.

637
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,810
问题是这样的  奎因女士
Here's the problem, Ms. Quinn...

638
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,840
我们手上有一大堆问题不是吗
We have a lot of problems here, don't we?

639
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,340
这些基金会的文件是玛娅签署的
...these foundation documents were signed by Maia.

640
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:13,440
{\an8}林德尔基金会

641
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,280
她不仅签了字  而且如她刚刚所承认的
And she signed them, she just admitted,

642
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,610
她是在她18岁生日当晚签的字
on the night of her birthday party, her 18th birthday.

643
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,320
所以她对这个基金会
So she is responsible

644
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,480
产生的所有违法行为负有法律责任
for any crimes committed by this foundation.

645
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,630
我们的供证协议是基于玛娅和基金会的关联
Our proffer is about Maia's involvement with this fund,

646
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,100
而不是戴安·洛哈特的建议
not Diane Lockhart's advice...

647
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,670
我不想做坏人
I hate to be the bad guy here,

648
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,060
但是数百万美元的资金驻留在那个基金会中
but millions of dollars were being parked into that foundation

649
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,410
以躲避证监会的审计
to hide them from an SEC audit.

650
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,640
这可是重罪
That is a felony crime.

651
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,860
那么现在  除非玛娅告诉我们戴安·洛哈特
Now, unless Maia tells us about Diane Lockhart's advice

652
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,930
{\an8}林德尔基金会

653
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,670
给了她父母什么建议  不然我们现在就停止盘问
to her parents, we will stop this questioning now

654
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,700
并对她提起指控
and prosecute.

655
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,430
我需要年满18岁才能让那些文件生效对吗
I need to be 18 for those documents to be official?

656
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,230
是的  而你当时年满18了
Yes. And you were.

657
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,500
你在18岁生日当天签的这些协议
You signed them on your 18th birthday.

658
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,420
我的18岁生日派对是周六举行的
We had my birthday party on a Saturday,

659
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,670
直到下个周二我才年满18岁
and I didn't turn 18 until the following Tuesday.

660
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,190
不是吧
Come on.

661
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,130
你知道吗
You know,

662
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,110
也许我是该尝一颗糖
maybe I will have one of those candies.

663
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,450
手段不错  探员
Nice try, Agent.

664
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,370
你当时对付布拉戈耶维奇也是用的这个手段吗
Is this the kind of finesse you used on Blagojevich?

665
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,410
干得漂亮  玛娅
Nice, Maia.

666
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,510
只是运气好
Lucky.

667
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,040
不  我见过什么叫走好运
No, I've seen lucky.

668
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,600
刚刚那叫聪明
That was smart.

669
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,060
{\an8}下午1点27分

670
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,380
我方还要传唤一位证人  法官阁下
I have another witness, Your Honor.

671
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,680
奈芙塔莉·阿马多
Naftali Amado.

672
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,790
我以为你说她是站在你们这边的
I thought you said she was on your side.

673
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,010
她是站在我们这边
She is.

674
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,280
她曾站在我们这边
She was.

675
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,310
奈芙塔莉
Naftali.

676
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,380
你好  阿马多女士
Hello, Ms. Amado.

677
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,200
你好  汉子
Hello, man.

678
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,570
斯威尼先生被叫住靠边停车的时候你在他车上
You were with Mr. Sweeney when his car was pulled over,

679
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,110
-对吗  -是的
- isn't that correct? - Ken.

680
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,810
我们在法庭上说英语
We speak English here.

681
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,510
-是的  -希伯来语太让我兴奋了
- Yes. - Hebrew makes me so hot.

682
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,160
你们被叫住靠边停车后发生了什么
And what happened after you were pulled over?

683
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,230
那位警官  他走向我们
The policeman, he comes over to us.

684
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,990
他说  我们需要出示
He says, uh, we need to show the...

685
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,410
那个什么
the, um,

686
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,000
-驾  -驾照
- uh, lice? - License?

687
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,760
对  但是斯威尼先生
Yes. But, uh, Mr. Sweeney

688
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,800
当时脾气非常火爆[性感]
is very, very hot.

689
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,560
他下车
He gets out of the car,

690
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,070
打了那位警官
punches the policeman.

691
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,560
真是岂有此理
That is outrageous.

692
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
你才是岂有此理
You are outrageous.

693
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,060
-你  -你给我坐下
- You... - You sit back down.

694
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,660
抱歉  女士  我来说就好
Excuse me, ma'am. That is my job.

695
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,220
请保持克制  斯威尼先生
Please, Mr. Sweeney.

696
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,690
还有别的问题吗  律师
Any more questions, Counselor?

697
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,610
没有了
Nothing further.

698
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,630
粉刷完成了  你们可以从这边进来了
Painting's done. You can come in this way now.

699
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,430
这边请
Here you go.

700
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,970
请坐
Have a seat.

701
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,940
我想先为之前的
I'd like to apologize for the uncomfortable mess...

702
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,100
不愉快道歉
...earlier this afternoon.

703
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,660
都怪我  我的错  抱歉
It was all on me. My bad. I'm sorry.

704
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,170
我不想让我们之间剑拔弩张
I don't want things to be tense between us.

705
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,380
-我们也不想  -很好
- We don't either. - Good.

706
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,700
那么我们重归于好了吗
So we're friends again?

707
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,610
-当然  -好的  很好
- Sure. - Okay. Good.

708
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,060
玛娅  我们来聊聊你是什么时候得知
Maia, um, let's talk about when you did become aware

709
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,520
这场庞氏骗局的
of the Ponzi scheme.

710
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,530
你说是媒体报道时你才得知的
You said it was when the press reported on it.

711
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,450
是的
Yes.

712
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,030
而不是在此之前
And not before?

713
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,600
完全正确
That is correct.

714
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,890
你是2016年从法学院毕业的  对吗
You graduated from law school in 2016, right?

715
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,530
是的
Yes.

716
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,700
那天是不是个大日子
Was it a big day?

717
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,160
我不太明白你的意思
I don't understand.

718
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,650
当天在你父母家有个庆祝会
Well, there was a celebration at your parents' house.

719
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,090
敬美妙的一年
To a fantastic year.

720
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,330
是的  确实有
Yes, there was.

721
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,430
你父母在场吗
Your parents were there?

722
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,890
艾米的父母当时在场吗
Amy's parents were there?

723
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,500
谢谢你们能来  玛娅
Thank you for being here. Oh, Maia...

724
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,360
是的  山姆和康妮
Yes, Sam and Connie.

725
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,490
好的  山姆和康妮
Okay. Sam and Connie.

726
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,310
你当时从法学院
Now, were you living with Amy, uh, 

727
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,210
毕业之时和艾米在同居吗
at the time when you graduated from law school?

728
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,860
-是的  -艾米有没有问起过让她父母
- I was. - Did Amy ever ask you about the possibility

729
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,650
投资你父母管理的基金的可行性
of her parents investing in your parents' fund?

730
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,120
她问过
She asked about it.

731
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,250
我告诉她要开设投资账户
And I told her that to start an account,

732
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,350
最低投资金额是20万美元
it-it was a minimum of $200,000.

733
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,960
她的父母拿不出那么多钱
Her parents didn't have that kind of money.

734
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,520
据我了解到的信息  可能不一定对
According to my information... and I could be wrong...

735
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,460
你父母对那个最低投资金额破过例
your parents did make exceptions to that requirement.

736
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,550
那是个问题吗
Is that a question?

737
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,450
不是
No.

738
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,650
这个才是
This is one.

739
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,140
你有没有请求过你父母能不能
Did you ever ask if an exception could be made

740
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,240
为艾米的父母破个例
in the case of Amy's parents?

741
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:56,950
抱歉
Sorry.

742
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,610
她为什么要撒谎
Why would she lie?

743
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,640
我不知道  她是个调皮的小骚货
I don't know. She's such a naughty minx.

744
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,270
可能她觉得是在开玩笑
It could be her idea of a joke.

745
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,530
斯威尼先生  请认真点
Mr. Sweeney, please take this seriously.

746
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,530
我猜因非法持有毒品
I imagine a felony arrest

747
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,790
导致的被捕会让她被驱逐出境
for drug possession could get her deported.

748
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,770
什么
I'm sorry?

749
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,360
你又是哪位呀
Who are you again?

750
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,830
这间律师的一位合伙人
A partner here.

751
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,410
持有毒品这一说从何而来
Where does the drug possession come in?

752
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,390
犯罪报告里只字未提
There was nothing in the crime report.

753
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,910
那么  合伙人女士
Well, partner,

754
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,410
我就是假设一下
I'm just theorizing here,

755
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,340
但我们当时是在去阿灵顿山庄参加一个
but we were on our way to a chemsex party

756
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,370
-药爱派对的路上  -等等
- in Arlington Heights. - Wait, wait.

757
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,580
我们先打住
We need to stop right there.

758
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,340
你得用假设的语气来说
You need to speak in hypotheticals,

759
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,520
-斯威尼先生  -但是  为什么呢
- Mr. Sweeney. - But... why?

760
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,660
我们不能在明知你会作伪证的情况下让你出庭
We can't put you on the stand knowing you will perjure yourself.

761
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,820
你只能表述真实
You can only relate something that is true

762
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,050
或者潜在真实的事实
or potentially true.

763
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,020
天啊  我爱死法律了
God, I love the law.

764
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,770
每个人都这么认真
And everybody takes it so seriously.

765
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,640
-是你办的派对吗  -没错
- Your party? - Yes.

766
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,040
药爱派对
Chemsex.

767
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,310
药爱  不知道吗
Chemse... No?

768
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,630
兴奋剂鸡尾酒  然后做爱
Drug cocktails, then sex.

769
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,000
极具启发效果
Most enlightening.

770
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,370
-假设来说  -是的
- Hypothetically. - Yes.

771
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,060
假设来说  奈芙塔莉和我
Naftali and I were hypothetically

772
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,350
当时正在去这个派对的途中
on our way to this party, where we were...

773
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,400
而且假设  我们准备吃合成性卡西酮类药物
hypothetically going to supply the synthetic cathinone.

774
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,490
那为什么在警方的报告中
And why was there no mention

775
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,160
没有提到有关毒品的事
of drugs in the police report?

776
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,990
我们停下来的时候
Naftali threw them out the window

777
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,090
奈芙塔莉把药扔出车窗外了
when we were stopped. Uh...

778
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,300
假设来说
Hypothetically.

779
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,410
阿德里安
Adrian.

780
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,530
我想我们有大麻烦了
I think we're in trouble.

781
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,310
我浏览了警察的电话记录  调查泰鲁的活动
I was scanning police calls, following Theroux's movements.

782
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:28,490
他当时申请调用军犬来停车现场调查
He was calling for some K9 units to the scene of the pullover.

783
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,590
靠
Fuck.

784
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,340
-他们找到药了吗  -找到了
- They found them? - Yeah.

785
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,440
你们打算怎么办
What are you gonna do?

786
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,800
我不知道
I don't know.

787
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,340
当证据对你有利时  反复落实证据就好
When the facts are on your side, you pound the facts.

788
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,390
当证据不对你有利时
When the facts are not on your side...

789
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,580
得了吧
Come on.

790
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,450
你在开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

791
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,550
辩方律师  马上坐下
Counselor, sit down right now.

792
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,580
会轮到你的  请继续  助理检察官
You'll get your turn. Continue, Mr. ASA

793
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,820
我再问一遍  泰鲁警官
Again, Officer Theroux,

794
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,820
你今天早晨是否在
did you conduct a search this morning in an area

795
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,250
丹莱恩高速公路的邻接区域进行了搜查
immediately adjacent to the Dan Ryan Expressway?

796
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,040
-是的  -为什么要搜查呢
- I did. - And what occasioned that search?

797
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,350
因为在前一天晚上  我亲眼看到有个东西
The night before, I witnessed an object being thrown

798
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,810
从嫌疑人车的副驾驶座位上扔了出去
from the passenger side of the suspect's car...

799
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,850
他为什么当天晚上没有搜查呢  法官阁下
Come on! Why did he not search the night before, Your Honor?

800
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,160
这就是胡说八道
This is bullshit!

801
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,100
先生  你立刻给我停止
Sir, you will stop right now

802
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,140
不然我就要判你为藐视法庭  继续提问
or we will discuss contempt charges. Go ahead.

803
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,750
事实上  那是个好问题
Well, that is a good question.

804
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,200
你为什么不在前一天晚上就搜查那个区域呢
Why didn't you search the area the night before?

805
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,870
我搜了  但那有茂密的灌木丛还有一个水沟
I did. But there's thick brush there and a gully.

806
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,970
我不可能找到的
I couldn't find anything.

807
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,940
所以我今天早上带着军犬重回那
So I went back with a K9 unit this morning...

808
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,410
引用这种记忆还真是方便
Talk about a convenient memory.

809
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,130
女士  停
Ma'am. No.

810
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,260
谢谢  法官阁下
Thank you, Your Honor.

811
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,960
请你告诉我们
Please, tell the court what,

812
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,960
-你找到了什么东西  -一个白色的塑料袋
- if anything, you found. - A white plastic bag

813
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,840
装有约1.5克的合成性卡西酮类药物
containing approximately 1.5 grams of a synthetic cathinone

814
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,390
-就是常说的毒品浴盐  -没有其它问题了
- commonly known as bath salts. - Nothing further.

815
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,300
他们为什么不把仪表盘的摄像头作为证据呢  
Why aren't they introducing the dashboard cam into evidence? 

816
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,410
博斯曼先生和洛哈特女士
Mr. Boseman, Ms. Lockhart,

817
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,510
你们俩还需要继续捶桌子吗
are you both done pounding your table?

818
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,840
我道歉  法官阁下
I apologize, Your Honor.

819
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,100
但基于警官新证词的重要性
But given the significance of the officer's new testimony,

820
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,670
我很好奇为什么没有看到
I'm curious why we're not seeing

821
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,920
事发时他仪表盘所录下的视频
his dashboard video of the encounter.

822
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,500
好问题  助理检察官
Good question. Mr. ASA?

823
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,830
法官阁下  视频中不包含任何无罪证据
Your Honor, there's nothing exculpatory on that recording.

824
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,190
好吧  这我就放心了  法官阁下
Oh, well, that's a relief, Your Honor.

825
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,770
我猜你还是想要看看这段视频吧
My guess is you would like to see it.

826
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,090
如果不是太麻烦的话
If it's not too much trouble.

827
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,510
控方有三个小时时间
The State has three hours

828
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,140
-给辩方提供仪表盘所录视频  -休庭
- to provide Defense with the dashboard video. - Adjourned.

829
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,980
想租车的话  得跟服务处预约
Hey, you want a rental, you got to talk to the office.

830
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,180
我不租车  想打听个名字
No, I need a name.

831
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,200
昨天晚上  你开车送的某个客人
Uh, last night, you drove someone.

832
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,700
西装男
A man in a suit.

833
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,160
这个人
This man.

834
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,790
-他做什么了  -没什么
- What'd he do? - Nothing.

835
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,480
他是一场车祸的目击证人
He's a witness to a car accident.

836
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,830
-理查德·赫斯  -他当时要去哪
- Richard Hess. - Where was he headed?

837
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,540
阿灵顿山庄的什么派对
Some party in Arlington Heights.

838
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,310
你好吗  小理
How are you, Rich?

839
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,430
我们认识吗
Do I know you?

840
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,980
我们没有正式见过
Uh, I don't think we've officially met,

841
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,810
但我知道你认识科林·斯威尼
but I know you know Colin Sweeney,

842
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,690
而且我想他可能需要你去为他出庭作证
and I think he may need you to testify on his behalf.

843
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,230
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

844
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,110
得了吧  兄弟  他领你去参加了
Come on, man. He was leading you

845
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,250
阿灵顿山庄的派对  药爱派对
to a party in Arlington Heights... the chemsex party...

846
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,900
但他的车被截停了
but his car got pulled over.

847
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,000
仪表盘的摄像头录下了你
This is you on the dashboard videotape.

848
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,380
你停下来等了他们几分钟
You waited a few minutes for them, 

849
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,200
但之后你就让司机开车走了
but then told the driver to keep going.

850
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,530
既然你明显已经蠢到家了
Since you're obviously a little dense,

851
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,200
那我就简单点来告诉你
let me dumb it down for you.

852
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,010
滚开
Fuck off.

853
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,490
这家伙绝对看到了什么  但他不肯作证
This guy definitely saw something, but he won't testify.

854
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,240
-我们可以收买他吗  -斯威尼先生
- Can we pay him? - Mr. Sweeney.

855
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,030
假设来说
Hypothetically.

856
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,700
我们可以把他看做一位敌意证人
We can treat him as a hostile witness.

857
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,710
-他为什么不肯作证  -他不想让大家知道
- Why won't he testify? - He doesn't want it to come out

858
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,520
他曾去过哪里
that he was going where he was going.

859
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,520
-哪里  -斯威尼先生要去的那个性爱派对
- And where was that? - The sex party Mr. Sweeney was going to.

860
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,730
他叫什么
What's his name?

861
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,090
理查德·赫斯  怎么  你认识他吗
Richard Hess. Why? You know him?

862
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,660
不认识  你们不能让他出庭作证
No. You will not put him on the stand.

863
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,220
你们无权这么做
You have no right!

864
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,290
你在说什么  他看到了所发生的事
What are you talking about? He saw what happened.

865
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,700
那可不一定
You don't know that.

866
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,400
我坚决要求你们不再联系他
I insist that you not contact him again,

867
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,260
不然我就另找其他的律师
or I'm hiring other lawyers.

868
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,420
-所以你确实打了那个警察  -没有
- So you did beat up that cop? - No.

869
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,390
什么  没有  
What? No. 

870
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,610
那为什么你不希望我们联系他
Why don't you want us to get this guy?

871
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,940
因为我不需要理由
Because I don't need a reason.

872
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,810
我在你办公室等你  戴安
I'll be in your office, Diane.

873
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,670
我想我明白了
I think I understand.

874
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,910
什么  我不明白
What? I don't.

875
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,480
理查德·赫斯是佛罗里达州的地产大亨 
Richard Hess is a Florida real estate billionaire

876
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,710
他被派到芝加哥来审查
who's been sent to Chicago to vet...

877
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,120
大使人选
ambassadors.

878
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,500
别那么看我
Don't act like that.

879
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,110
如果你不能买标价出售的东西
What's the point of being rich

880
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,950
那成为有钱人还有什么意思
if you can't buy what's for sale?

881
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,210
一个大使的职位
An ambassadorship?

882
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,730
我给他的政治行动委员会资助了一百多万美元
I gave over a million dollars to his campaign PAC.

883
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,670
会员是有特权的
Membership has its privileges.

884
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:52,530
所以施展你们的魔法  让这些控告消失吧
So work your magic and make these charges go away.

885
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,590
我必须看起来身家清白
I need to look clean.

886
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,190
那就让赫斯来为你出庭作证
Then get Hess to testify on your behalf.

887
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,310
泰鲁的毒品证词对你很不利
This drug testimony from Theroux hurts you. 

888
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,220
不行  想其它的办法
No. Find another way.

889
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,830
警察暴力执法案件是你们的专长
Police brutality is your specialty,

890
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,250
而我就是一个货真价实的受害者
and I'm a bona fide victim here!

891
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,730
并不是只有黑人才会被暴力执法的
It's not just the black people who get brutalized.

892
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,980
还有我这样的人  被误解的人
It's people like me... the misunderstood.

893
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,690
白人亿万富翁  众人宣称的杀妻犯
The white billionaire wife-killer, allegedly.

894
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,460
我的神啊
Oh, God.

895
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:28,980
玛娅
Maia.

896
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,820
她在试图暗示你知晓庞氏骗局
She's trying to suggest you knew about the Ponzi Scheme,

897
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,660
所以你才没有让艾米的父母加入基金
and that's why you waived Amy's parents off.

898
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,330
-我明白  -你真知道吗
- Yeah. I know. - Did you?

899
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,290
当然不知道
No.

900
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,490
但你听起来可并不确定
You don't sound definite.

901
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,150
你有告诉他我爸爸的退休账户里有11万美元
Did you tell him my father's IRA comes to $110,000,

902
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,600
而且还有三万美元国债了吗
that he's got another $30,000 in T-Bills?

903
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,410
我不知道  我
I don't know. I...

904
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,690
你不知道你是不是有意不让她父母投资的
You don't know if you waived Amy's parents off?

905
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,190
我知道这很困难
I know this has been hard...

906
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,210
我知道这几个月对你来说很不容易
I know these months have been hard on you, and you feel,

907
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,250
无论对错  你都为你父母的行为而有负罪感
rightly or wrongly, guilty for your parents' actions.

908
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,560
不  这和那些无关
No, that's not what this is.

909
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,320
你自己甚至都不会注意到  玛娅
You don't even need to be conscious of it, Maia.

910
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,890
你的负罪感可能会歪曲你的记忆
Your guilt could just be coloring your memories.

911
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,310
你可能会让自己承担远超于应受的罪责
You could be seeing yourself as more culpable than you are.

912
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,350
这是你的天主教罪恶
It's your Catholic guilt.

913
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,350
{\an8}天主教罪恶  指天主教教徒或堕落者
他们所供认的远超过他们实际应当承担的罪

914
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,570
你在自我谴责
You are condemning yourself.

915
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,970
在忏悔室里这么做没关系
That's fine for the confessional,

916
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,610
但在这里是要承担后果的
but here, it has real repercussions.

917
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,040
他们可以让你坐牢的
They could put you in jail.

918
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,280
你父亲真的会拒绝14万美金吗
Your father'd really turn down $140,000?

919
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,300
他一向如此
Ah. Well, he does it all the time.

920
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,300
你到底有没有告诉你父亲
Did you really tell your dad?

921
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,900
卢卡  我没告诉我父亲
Lucca, I didn't tell my dad.

922
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,140
没告诉他什么
Didn't tell him what?

923
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,670
我没告诉他艾米的父母想投资
About Amy's parents' investment.

924
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,870
我假装告诉他了  但是  我没告诉
I pretended to, but... I never told him.

925
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,230
你什么意思  我当然告诉我父亲了
What do you mean? Of course I told my dad.

926
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,410
我为什么会不说呢
Why wouldn't I?

927
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,800
好吧  情况不妙
Okay, this isn't good.

928
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,100
你是准备承认你闯了大祸
You're ready to admit you killed Biggie.

929
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,850
我一定是不知道从哪儿得知了庞氏骗局
I must have somehow known about the Ponzi scheme.

930
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:18,590
不然为什么我没让艾米的父母投资呢
Otherwise, why wouldn't I have let Amy's parents invest?

931
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,400
-这不能说明什么  -能
- That doesn't mean anything. - It does.

932
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,420
卢卡
Lucca.

933
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,130
我早知道
I knew.

934
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,050
问题在于那些毒品
The problem is the drugs.

935
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,400
除此以外的事法官都会听我们讲理
Judge was listening to us on everything else.

936
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,240
问题在于被扔出窗户的毒品
It's the drugs thrown out the freaking window.

937
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,650
所以我们利用赫斯
So we use Hess.

938
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,940
我们说服斯威尼必须利用他的审查者
We convince Sweeney he has to use his vetter.

939
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,580
不  我们得着手于毒品  戴安
No. We need to go at the drugs, Diane.

940
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,410
这也有助于我们应对平民警察问责办公室
That helps us with COPA, too.

941
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,620
他们想开除泰鲁
They want to kick Theroux off the force.

942
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,630
我们只是...
We just...

943
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,750
我们没有给他们足够的理由这么做
We haven't given 'em enough of a reason to do it.

944
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,090
那么我们就陷入僵局了
Then we're stuck.

945
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,680
戴安
Diane?

946
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,570
你在这里过得开心吗
You happy here?

947
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,090
在你的律所吗
What, at your firm?

948
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,280
是的
Yeah.

949
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,870
-开心啊  怎么了  -我不知道
- Yes. Why? - I don't know.

950
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,850
你本想退休的
You wanted to retire.

951
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,930
是啊
Yes.

952
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:27,300
生活会用它自己的方式告诉你你是谁
Well, life has a way of reminding you of who you are.

953
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,410
我想我不是那种会退休的人
Guess I'm not the retiring type.

954
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,910
你在这里过得开心吗
Are you happy here?

955
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:38,840
问住你了
Gotcha.

956
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,990
我喜欢...
I like...

957
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,360
打败别人和...
getting the better of people, and...

958
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,980
维持某些东西的生命
keeping something alive.

959
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,410
你知道吗  看着这里的这些员工
You know? Look out there

960
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:51,340
想着如果我不能让这家律所继续经营
at all those employees, and realizing

961
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,560
他们就可能会失业
they might not have jobs if I don't keep this going.

962
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,040
是的  这感觉很棒
Yeah. That is a good feeling.

963
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,050
好了
Okay.

964
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:01,900
该回家了
Time to go home.

965
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,150
我们什么时候一起吃个晚饭吧
Let's get dinner sometime.

966
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:06,550
好吗
Okay?

967
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,810
很好啊
That'd be nice.

968
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:09,980
是的
Yeah.

969
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:18,490
非法持有毒品
Possession.

970
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,380
这是非法持有毒品  笨蛋
It was possession! Stupid!

971
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,490
-什么  -我太笨了
- What? - I am so stupid.

972
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,990
它就在我们面前明摆着呢
It was right there in front of our eyes.

973
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,790
-什么明摆着  -他叫什么 
- What was? - What is his name?

974
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,760
托德·努特森
Todd Knutsen.

975
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,930
你认识
Are you familiar with

976
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:38,230
安德鲁·泰鲁警官吗  努特森先生
Officer Andrew Theroux, Mr. Knutsen?

977
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:41,510
认识  他就是几天前让我靠边停车的人
Oh, yeah. He's the one that pulled me over a few nights ago.

978
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:42,870
你能在法庭上讲讲当时发生了什么吗
Would you tell the court what happened?

979
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,170
我正从我母亲的住处开车回家
I was driving home from my mom's house.

980
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:47,700
他让我靠边停车  说我变换车道前
He pulled me over, said I was switching lanes

981
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,050
没有发信号  我发了信号的
without signaling. I wasn't.

982
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,700
他让我下车  这样他就能搜查我的车
He asked me to step out of the car so he could search it.

983
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,120
然后他用手铐拷住我
Then he handcuffs me and says

984
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,370
说我因持有海洛因被捕了
I'm under arrest for possession of heroin.

985
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,340
你持有海洛因吗
Were you in possession of heroin?

986
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,150
没有  是他放进我车里的
No, he planted it.

987
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,650
事实上  指控最终不是被撤销了吗
In fact, weren't the charges eventually dropped?

988
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,590
是的  今天撤销的
Yeah, just today.

989
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,590
其他的警察说他经常做这种事
The other cops say this happens a lot with him.

990
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,650
反对  法官阁下...
Objection, Your Honor...

991
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,450
反对有效  不过你可能要
Yes, sustained. But you might want to 

992
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,810
重新考虑这次起诉了  助理检察官先生
reconsider your charge here, Mr. ASA.

993
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,850
没有其他问题了  法官阁下  谢谢
Nothing further, your Honor. Thank you.

994
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,370
-麦克格拉斯先生  -没有问题了
- Mr. McGrath? - Nothing further.

995
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,700
证人可以离开了
The witness is dismissed.

996
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,680
谢谢你
Thank you.

997
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,160
谢谢
Thanks.

998
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,040
真的没必要这么做
That's really not necessary.

999
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,630
这不是什么大事
It's no big deal.

1000
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:47,930
这是证券交易委员会审查  当然是大事
It's a SEC audit. Of course it's a big deal.

1001
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:50,850
-算了吧 贾克斯  -你们俩能安静点吗
- Come on. Jax. - Would you two be quiet?

1002
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:51,860
亲爱的
Hey, hon.

1003
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,320
我们很快就会出来
We'll be right out.

1004
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,780
我觉得我们不应该
I don't think we should

1005
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,190
把你父母的钱和我父母的钱混在一起
entangle your parents' money with my parents'.

1006
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,420
基金出了什么问题吗
Is there something wrong with the fund?

1007
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,410
你还好吗
Are you good?

1008
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,600
我不知道
I don't know.

1009
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,240
听着  玛娅
Listen, Maia,

1010
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,460
我能想到很多原因解释
I can think of a dozen reasons

1011
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,760
你为什么不让艾米的父母投资
why you didn't let Amy's parents invest.

1012
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,130
首先  你不想把金钱和爱情混为一谈
First and foremost, you didn't want to mix up finances with love.

1013
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,490
我觉得这很有道理
That makes complete sense to me.

1014
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:35,800
你这么认为吗
You think so?

1015
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,480
是的
Yeah, I do.

1016
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,700
这次你准备好了吗
You ready again?

1017
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:42,910
最后一次看牙医
Last dentist visit.

1018
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,770
J.K.
J.K.

1019
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,970
代表"只是开玩笑的"
That's "Just kidding."

1020
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:48,620
小孩子们都这么说
It's what the kids say.

1021
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,940
感谢你的帮忙
I wanted to thank you for you help.

1022
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,500
不用客气
You're welcome.

1023
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,870
我还希望你明白
And I wanted to let you know

1024
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,400
好人没好报
that no good deed goes unpunished.

1025
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,800
大约一小时前  某个亿万富翁被任命为
About an hour ago, some billionaire was named

1026
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,030
下一任驻德国大使了
the next ambassador to Germany.

1027
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:07,360
我输了
I lost it.

1028
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,800
听到这个消息我很遗憾
I'm sorry to hear that.

1029
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,920
我简直不敢相信我浪费了四个月学德语
I can't believe I wasted four months trying to learn German.

1030
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,860
我  不
Ich. Nicht.

1031
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,660
我相信你会撑过去的
Well, I'm sure you'll survive.

1032
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,650
而且  你也不用涉身我们对库克县的诉讼了
Also, it'll free you up for our lawsuit against Cook County.

1033
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,160
泰鲁已经被开除了
Theroux's been kicked off the force,

1034
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,610
但我们正在准备一个600万美元的民事诉讼案
but we've got a six million dollar civil suit in the works.

1035
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,070
不  我不会那么做的
Uh, no, I'm not doing that.

1036
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,140
你会的
Uh, yes, you are.

1037
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,480
不  抱歉
No. Sorry.

1038
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,690
我正努力竞选驻梵蒂冈大使
I'm trying for Ambassador to the Vatican.

1039
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,240
再次感谢
Again, thanks.

1040
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,700
我会再来拜访的
I'll drop by again.

1041
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,270
你准备好结束这事了吗  玛娅
Are you ready to finish this up, Maia?

1042
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:49,720
她准备好了
She is. 

1043
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,430
你问我为什么我不让艾米的父母向基金投资
You asked me why I didn't want Amy's parents to invest in the fund.

1044
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,310
事实是  把家庭和金钱混为一谈
And the truth is, it just seemed like a bad idea

1045
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:59,530
不是个好主意
to mix family and finances.

1046
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,140
据我的经验  玛娅
In my experience, Maia,

1047
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,440
当一个人说"事实是"的时候
whenever somebody says, "The truth is,"

1048
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,170
往往意味着他说的不是事实
that usually means it's not.

1049
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,190
-不是这样的  -我很喜欢你  玛娅
- That's not... - I like you, Maia.

1050
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,830
我觉得你很聪明  又有洞察力
I think you're smart, I think you're perceptive,

1051
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,390
但我认为你犯罪了
and I think you committed a crime here.

1052
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,240
我认为你知道你父母的庞氏骗局
I think you knew about your parents' Ponzi scheme,

1053
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,080
我将向联邦检察官办公室
and I'm going to recommend

1054
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,040
提议起诉你
prosecution by the U.S. Attorney's Office.

1055
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,440
-这是供证协议环节  -是  但她说谎了
- This was a proffer session! - Yes, but she lied.

1056
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,020
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.
