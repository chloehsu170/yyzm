{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,100
杰西卡・皮尔逊上庭
Jessica Pearson in court.

16
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,120
我可是很久没见到了
I haven't seen that in a while.

17
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,890
我们接了一个"无罪计划"的案子
We took over an Innocence Project case.

18
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,000
他杀了我女儿
He killed my girl!

19
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,840
但我相信伦纳德・贝利是无辜的
But I believe that Leonard Bailey is innocent,

20
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,980
我会确保他得到自己本该得到的公正判决
and I'm going to make sure that he gets the fair trial that he never had.

21
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,770
方法就是找些瘾君子来做证人吗
By tracking down some junkie witness?

22
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,480
玛利亚・戈麦斯以前都没有机会说出证词
Maria Gomez never had a chance to be heard.

23
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,620
伦纳德・贝利不在场证明的证人死了
Leonard Bailey's alibi witness is dead.

24
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,080
这不代表她的证词不存在
That doesn't mean her testimony is.

25
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,000
你想让我给她告诉我的事作证吗
You want me to testify to what she told me?

26
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,520
我徒弟冒昧地起草了一份宣誓证明
My protégé took the liberty of drawing up a sword affidavit.

27
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,400
现在你要么签了它
You can either sign it

28
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,420
要么在宣誓后撒谎说这是假的
or you can lie under oath that this isn't true.

29
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,890
你们的意思是本案由于伦纳德・贝利的
Are you saying that this case needs to be re-opened

30
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,700
代理人工作不充分  应予以重审吗
based on Leonard Bailey having inadequate representation?

31
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,930
我们就一定会这样做
It sure as hell is our plan now.

32
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,710
你设计坑我
You set me up.

33
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,010
我保证让这件事人尽皆知
I'm gonna make sure the world knows it.

34
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,160
你可以告诉任何人任何事  威廉
You can tell the world anything you want, William.

35
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,540
但是你没有证据
But you got no proof.

36
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,090
总之  我劝你还是签字同意这笔交易
Either way, I suggest you sign this deal.

37
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,640
-你好  -是我
- Hello? - Hey, it's me.

38
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,910
我可以回家了
I'm coming home.

39
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,990
-我们做到了  -做到了
- We did it. - We did.

40
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,910
天哪  这是有多少人要来啊
Whoa, how many people are joining us?

41
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,750
我不确定你想喝哪种威士忌
Wasn't sure which Scotch you'd want,

42
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,610
所以我干脆全点了
so I went ahead and ordered them all.

43
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,010
那我要是想喝啤酒呢
What if I'm in the mood for a beer?

44
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,920
你刚出狱
You just got out of prison.

45
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,680
不会想喝啤酒的
You're not in the mood for a beer.

46
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,010
好吧  你说对了
Yeah, you're right.

47
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,680
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

48
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,830
真他妈好喝
Oh, damn that tastes good.

49
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,140
那还不是我为你准备的最好的东西
That's not even the best thing I have for ya.

50
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,330
-是一份工作  -看看上面的金额
- It's an offer letter. - Take a look at the number.

51
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,100
这是我做初级合伙人时挣的金额
This is the same money I made as a junior partner.

52
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,640
因为你就是初级合伙人
Because you are a junior partner.

53
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,710
还是当下最好的  我们需要你
The best there is. And we need you.

54
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,050
我才刚出狱  我可不想再进去
I just got out of prison. I'm not trying to go back.

55
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,860
你不会再进去的
You're not going back,

56
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,900
因为你是要干着律师的活儿
because even though you'll be acting as a lawyer,

57
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,150
你的头衔会是"顾问"
your title's gonna be "Consultant."

58
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,520
听着  哈维  谢谢你的邀请  但是
Look, Harvey, I appreciate the gesture, but...

59
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,610
因为我  大家都离开了那家律所
everyone left that firm because of me.

60
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,890
我不会再这样害你了
I'm not gonna do that to you again.

61
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,860
-迈克...  -不  听我说
- Mike-- - No, listen to me.

62
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,620
你做得够多了  你不用再为我做这个
You've done enough, you don't have to do this for me.

63
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,040
我不是为了你  我是为了我自己
I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for me.

64
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,140
我怀念和你共事的感觉
I miss working with you.

65
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,960
我也很怀念
I miss working with you, too.

66
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,490
那就帮帮忙  考虑一下
Then do me a favor: just think about it.

67
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,920
假如几天之后答案还是"不"
If the answer's still "no" in a few days,

68
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,880
我就不会再提起这件事了
I won't bring it up again.

69
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,800
你从来都不在家  这就是原因
Because you're never here, that's why!

70
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,850
我们讨论过这个问题了  芙吉妮娅
We've been over this, Virginia.

71
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,220
-我尽了义务  -这就是问题  亚伦
- I do my part. - That's the problem, Alan.

72
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,780
你以为你的义务就只是挣钱养家
You think your part is just getting a paycheck.

73
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,650
挣钱养家
A paycheck?

74
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,330
我们家的条件比我们认识的任何一家都好
This family lives like no other family we know.

75
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,550
-杰西卡  亲爱的...  -怎么了
- Jessica, honey-- - What's going on?

76
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,480
我们只是在争论
We're just having an argument.

77
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,430
会没事的
It'll be okay.

78
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,150
你没必要在她面前遮遮掩掩  亚伦
You don't need to sugarcoat things for her, Alan.

79
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,960
假如你能在我们身边而不是在外面
And you'd know this if you were ever here

80
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,980
忙你自己的事你就会明白这一点
instead of out doing whatever it is you're doing.

81
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,610
我忙的是救命的事  你知道的
What I'm out doing is saving lives, and you know it.

82
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,350
也许你像尽心对待你的病人一样
Well, maybe if you worked as hard on our relationship

83
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,540
用心对待我们的关系
as you do for your patients,

84
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,650
就不会出现现在这种情况了
what's happening wouldn't be happening.

85
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,290
现在什么情况
What's happening?

86
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,960
你父亲和我要分开一段时间
Your father and I are taking a little break for a while.

87
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,560
多久
How long?

88
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,990
我不知道  宝贝
I don't know, baby.

89
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,480
我不知道
I don't know.

90
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,460
哈维
Harvey?

91
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,550
我很乐意闲聊  但我一小时后要上庭
I'd love to chit chat, but I've got trial in an hour,

92
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,280
所以不是什么要紧的事的话...
so unless it's urgent...

93
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,490
我只是想谢谢你
I just wanted to thank you.

94
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,370
为迈克的事
For Mike.

95
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,490
你不用为了这事谢我
You don't have to thank me for that.

96
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,260
我和你一样想要他出来
I wanted him out as much as you did.

97
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,140
我知道  但萨特的问题上你不必挺我的
I know, but you didn't have to back me when it came to Sutter,

98
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,100
而你挺了我
and you did.

99
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,290
你也会为我做同样的事情的
You would've done the same for me.

100
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,360
如今他出来了
And now that he is out,

101
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,810
我们就好好工作  把律所维护下去吧
let's get back to the business of keeping this firm alive.

102
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,450
如果是我  首先我会保住吉姆・雷诺兹
If I were you, I would start by locking up Jim Reynolds.

103
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,080
-什么  -你在说什么
- Excuse me? - What're you talking about?

104
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,630
我在说你们的第一个客户
I'm talking about the fact that your first client

105
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,700
正在背着你们偷偷想投奔别家
is shopping for another attorney behind your back.

106
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,490
别告诉我你准备出手了
Don't tell me, you're about to pounce.

107
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,240
我没想挖你们的墙脚  哈维
I'm not trying to poach your client, Harvey.

108
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,720
但如果你们留不住他  我就不客气了
But if you can't keep him, I will.

109
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,360
我很感谢你为此前来  罗伯特
I appreciate you coming down here, Robert,

110
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,730
但给对手通风报信这种事
but it's not exactly your style

111
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,990
可不是你的风格啊
to give the competition a heads-up.

112
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,290
我小时候
When I was kid,

113
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,130
洋基队和红袜队是有史以来最棒的对手
the Yankees and the Red Sox were the best damn rivalry ever.

114
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,080
你想说什么
What's your point?

115
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,740
我想说的是
My point is,

116
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,000
自从巴基・登特在78年
after Bucky Dent hit that

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,250
打出了那个完美的全垒打
beautiful home run in '78,

118
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,280
红袜队就没落了
the Sox fell off a cliff.

119
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,880
此后再也没什么乐趣了
It wasn't any fun anymore.

120
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,610
你是说你不想称霸这个领域吗
You're saying you don't want to dominate the division?

121
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,920
我是说你们没落了
I'm saying you fell off a cliff.

122
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,240
如果你们想有机会重返赛场...
And if you want a chance to get back in the game...

123
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,480
我们最好留住吉姆・雷诺兹
We better keep Jim Reynolds.

124
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,990
而且最好立刻行动
And you better get on it right now.

125
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,420
因为我可能不会挖你们墙脚
Because I may not be looking to pounce,

126
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,440
但市里其他的律所会
but every firm in this city is.

127
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,070
该死的
Damn it.

128
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,010
现在最不需要的就是吉姆・雷诺兹的离开
The last thing we need is Jim Reynolds leaving right now.

129
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,690
为什么不打电话呢  就像上次那样
What happened to calling, like he did last time,

130
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,800
而要背着我们行动
instead of going behind our backs?

131
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,660
我告诉你为什么
I'll tell you what happened.

132
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,080
他就像他说的那样被董事会施压了
He's getting pressure from his board like he said he would.

133
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,610
而你说我们会在月底之前回归正轨
And you said we'd get back on our feet by the end of the month

134
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,040
我们确实做到了
and we did.

135
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,550
你就是要去告诉他们这一点
And that's exactly what you're gonna tell them.

136
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,620
为什么是我去
What do you mean me?

137
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,710
你是没听到我五分钟前和你说的话吗
Did you not hear what I just told you five minutes ago?

138
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,420
-我一小时后要上庭  -我不管
- I've got trial in an hour. - I don't care.

139
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,430
一开始你就是他的首席律师
You've been his lead attorney since they got here.

140
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,830
如果你不亲自去  我们就要失去他了
If you don't go over yourself, we're gonna lose him.

141
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,340
-那你带路易去  -杰西卡
- Then take Louis with you. - Jessica--

142
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,580
哈维  你只要跟他们开诚布公
Harvey, all you have to do is open up our books

143
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,700
展现出我们实力依旧就行了
and show them we're standing on solid ground.

144
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,720
或者你可以先处理这件事  庭审申请延期
Or you can make this the priority and get a continuance.

145
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,570
这是个死刑的上诉案  哈维
It's a death row appeal, Harvey.

146
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,100
如果我一开庭就说我的公司比人命还重要
How's it gonna look if I start a trial saying that my business

147
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
别人会怎么看
is more important than a man's life?

148
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,930
你可以不这么说
You don't say that.

149
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,430
就说有其他的原因
You come up with some other reason.

150
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,670
不管我找什么理由
Whatever reason I come up with,

151
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,910
检察官都会说我不在乎人命
that prosecutor's gonna make it look like I don't care.

152
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,200
我不会冒这个险的
And I'm not taking that risk.

153
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,380
-杰西卡  -行了  别说了
- Jessica-- - No, enough.

154
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,640
如果你想谢我在迈克的事上挺了你一把
You want to thank me for having your back with Mike,

155
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,160
那就搞定这件事
then take care of this.

156
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,560
唐娜  格蕾琴在哪
Donna, where the hell is Gretchen?

157
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,190
-我不知道  -你给我把她找来
- I have no idea. - Well, you need to find her.

158
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,100
哈维  怎么了  你找她干什么
Harvey, what's going on? What do you need her for?

159
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,610
我不是找她  我是要找路易
I don't need her, I need Louis,

160
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,680
我不知道他去哪了
and I don't know where he is.

161
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,650
你干吗不早说
Well, why didn't you start with that?

162
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,240
他和客户有个紧急会议  他赶去开会了
He had an emergency meeting with a client and he ran out of here.

163
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,940
-什么时候  -半小时前
- When? - Half an hour ago.

164
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,010
他离开前我看到他进电梯了
I saw him at the elevators before he left.

165
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,090
他一回来你马上告诉他
You tell him the second he gets back

166
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,490
我有事情要跟他谈
I need to talk to him.

167
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,040
哈维  什么事
Harvey, what's going on?

168
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,060
吉姆・雷诺兹威胁我们说要解约
Jim Reynolds is threatening to leave.

169
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,970
什么
What?

170
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,360
哈维  他警告杰西卡的那晚我也在
Harvey, I was there the night he put Jessica on notice.

171
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,270
如果他要离开  那你可没时间等路易
If he's leaving, then you don't have time to wait for Louis.

172
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,320
我知道  但如果我搞不定雷诺兹
I know, but if I can't make it work with Reynolds,

173
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,450
我一回来就需要路易帮忙
I'm gonna need Louis the second I get back.

174
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,620
我这就去
I'm on it.

175
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,380
这是什么玩意
What the hell is this?

176
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,980
你知道这是什么  传票
You know what that is. It's a subpoena.

177
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,530
我签了宣誓书  你已经得到想要的了
I signed your affidavit. You have what you need.

178
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,210
你不会真以为你不用给贝利的
Did you really think you wouldn't have to testify

179
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,510
不在场证明作证吧
that Bailey had an alibi?

180
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,230
我只是没想到你会把我
What I didn't think was that you were going to

181
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,540
定义成不称职
paint me as incompetent.

182
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,060
我们做了12年前你本该做的事
We did what you should've done 12 years ago.

183
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,790
代表好自己的委托人
Represent your client.

184
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,340
我经手这件案子的时候
And you weren't even forming sentences

185
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,360
你还不会说话呢
when I handled this case.

186
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,050
但我现在会说了  所以你不用生气
Well, I'm forming sentences now, so instead of being angry,

187
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,000
你应该谢谢我们没有代表伦纳德
you should be thanking us for not bringing an action

188
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,630
起诉你
against you on Leonard's behalf.

189
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,940
-放马过来  -乔治娜  你犯了错误
- Bring it on. - Georgina, you made a mistake.

190
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,370
不管你是否愿意
We're giving you the chance to fix it

191
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,020
我们是在给你机会改正它
whether you like it or not.

192
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,020
我才不在乎你在做什么
I don't give a shit what you think you're doing.

193
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,710
我不是来改正错误的
I'm not here to fix it.

194
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,530
我来这里是因为这个
I'm here because of this.

195
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,530
那我们法庭见了
Then I'll see you on the stand.

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,220
哈维  你怎么来了
Harvey, what're you doing here?

197
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,190
我是来阻止你食言的
I'm here to stop you from breaking your word.

198
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,080
那我建议
Then I suggest you turn around

199
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,750
你还是向后转赶紧离开这里
and walk out of here as fast as you can.

200
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,150
你先听我说
Look, just hear me out.

201
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,550
你跟杰西卡谈的那晚
The night you spoke to Jessica,

202
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,220
我们是损失了75%的收入来源
we'd lost 75% of our revenue stream.

203
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,240
-但从那天起  -你听我说
- But since then-- - Listen to me.

204
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,820
我的董事会和你们的收入没有关系
My taking meetings has nothing to do with your revenue stream.

205
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,320
那到底是为了什么
Then what the hell's this about?

206
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,600
是关于你故意搞砸了
It's about the rumors that you tanked

207
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,200
威廉・萨特的案子
William Sutter's case.

208
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,370
-我什么都没干  -我也是这么说的
- I didn't tank shit. - I told him that.

209
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,610
我一个字都不相信
I don't believe any of it.

210
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,370
你信不信不重要  吉姆
Well, it doesn't matter what you believe, Jim.

211
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,480
董事会信就够了
Because the board believes it.

212
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,310
让我猜猜看  你是董事会成员
And let me guess, you're the board.

213
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,540
唐纳德・曼尼斯
Donald Mannis.

214
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,430
我可以和你握手  但我不想让你
I'd shake your hand, but I wouldn't want your

215
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,310
阴险的职业道德玷污了我
shady ethics rubbing off on me.

216
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,570
唯一能玷污你的东西  唐纳德
The only thing that's rubbing off on you, Donald,

217
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,060
就是威廉・萨特的一堆屁话
is a load of bullshit from William Sutter.

218
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,770
你的前任助理曾和是他女婿在监狱的室友
Your former associate was in prison with his son-in-law,

219
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,210
萨特倒闭的那天正是你伙计出狱的那天
and the day Sutter goes down, your guy gets out.

220
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,490
你可以说这都是扯淡的
You may call that bullshit,

221
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,270
但我觉得这事听起来合情合理
but his story adds up to me.

222
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,270
我们公司不能有一个
And this company can't have an attorney

223
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,110
会出卖自己客户的律师
who's willing to turn on his own client.

224
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,160
知道我的难处了吗
You see what I'm dealing with?

225
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,390
我开董事会只是
I only took those meetings because I'm being pressured

226
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,330
迫于压力
to take those meetings.

227
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,530
我懂了  这个混蛋要篡你的位
I get it. That asshole wants your job.

228
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,700
他不只是想
He doesn't just want it.

229
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,680
如果我不让你走  他可就要得逞了
If I don't let you go, he's gonna get it.

230
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,950
唯一可能改变局面的就是让杰西卡进来
And the one thing that might've changed that was Jessica

231
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,430
向他展示一下我们对她的重要性
coming in here and showing him how important we are to her.

232
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,400
你对她很重要  吉姆
You are important to her, Jim.

233
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,900
但杰西卡现在正在庭审
But Jessica's in trial right now.

234
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,200
那你应该派路易・利特来
Then you should've sent Louis Litt,

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,910
因为那个混蛋最不想看到的就是
because the last thing that asshole needed to see

236
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,940
看到你出现在这里
when he walked in here was you.

237
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,560
法官大人  请求将证人视为敌意证人
Your Honor, permission to treat the witness as hostile.

238
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,460
什么理由
On what grounds?

239
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,690
证人还一句话没说呢
The witness hasn't even said anything yet.

240
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,110
理由是五分钟前
On the grounds that five minutes ago,

241
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,680
她告诉我她宁愿不让伦纳德・贝利一案
she told me she'd sooner deny Leonard Bailey

242
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,780
重审也不会冒险承认自己失职
a new trial than to risk looking incompetent.

243
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,800
是真的吗
Is this true?

244
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,290
是
Yes.

245
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,630
批准
Then permission granted.

246
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,000
凯西女士  你做伦纳德・贝利的公诉人时
Ms. Casey, when you were Leonard Bailey's public defender,

247
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,540
他有告诉过你案发当时
did he tell you that at the time of the murders,

248
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,450
他在一个名叫玛利亚・戈麦斯女人的公寓里吗
he was in the apartment of a woman named Maria Gomez?

249
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,350
是的
Yes.

250
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,490
也就是说他不但有不在场证明
Which means he not only had an alibi,

251
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,250
还有一个能作证的证人
he had a witness that could testify to it.

252
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,930
-我说的对吗  -对
- Is that correct? - Yes.

253
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,620
那到底为什么这个证人从来没有出庭
Then why in God's name didn't that witness ever take the stand?

254
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,090
因为她在庭审开始前
Because she left town without telling anyone

255
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,800
没通知任何人就离开了
right before the trial started.

256
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,370
-你找过她吗  -我找过
- Did you try to locate her? - Yes, I did.

257
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,190
-你有多努力找她  -尽我所能
- How hard did you look? - I did my best.

258
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,600
事实是  你根本就没有找她  对不对
The truth is, you didn't look for her at all, did you?

259
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,440
并非如此
That's not true.

260
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,360
我尽了所有努力去找她了
I did everything I could to try to find her.

261
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,220
但你并没有找到
But you didn't.

262
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,420
如果你找到了
And if you had,

263
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,710
那就应该有一个不在场证人
there would have been an alibi witness

264
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,590
向陪审团证明他根本
that would've told the jury that he couldn't have possibly

265
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,490
没有作案的可能
have committed those murders.

266
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,880
那个证人是个有前科的瘾君子
That witness was a drug addict with a prior conviction,

267
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,630
就算上庭会作证也会被检方驳斥到死
and she would have been eviscerated on the stand.

268
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,050
所以你又何必去找她呢
Then why did you try to find her at all?

269
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,040
我来设想一下吧
Let me suggest an answer.

270
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,080
你去找了她  因为你知道如果你找了
You did try to find her, because you knew if you did,

271
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,920
伦纳德・贝利就会被判无罪
Leonard Bailey would be found innocent.

272
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,400
但你没有做到
But you dropped the ball.

273
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,790
伦纳德・贝利成了死囚
Leonard Bailey went to death row.

274
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,080
而你宁愿他不被平反
And you'd rather let him stay there

275
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,960
也不愿承认事实
than to admit the truth.

276
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,600
凯西小姐  在你眼里
Ms. Casey, in your estimation,

277
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,300
伦纳德・贝利是无辜的吗
was Leonard Bailey innocent?

278
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,600
反对  法官大人  这是提出结论
Objection, Your Honor, calls for a conclusion.

279
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,120
法官大人
Your Honor,

280
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,910
她们让她作证就是为了证明他是否无辜
they opened the door to this when they put her on the stand,

281
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,590
没有人比他自己的律师更有资格做结论
and no one is more qualified to answer than his own attorney.

282
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,250
我允许了  凯西小姐请回答
I'll allow it. Ms. Casey?

283
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,720
我当时认为伦纳德・贝利是有罪的
I thought Leonard Bailey was guilty.

284
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,370
现在也这么认为
And I still do.

285
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,900
路易  下次你有什么紧急会议
Louis, the next time you have an emergency meeting,

286
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,170
给我提前说一声
you better clear it with me.

287
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,990
我会记住的  哈维
I'll keep that in mind for the future, Harvey.

288
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,410
但我有紧急会议就是因为你
But the reason I had an emergency meeting was you.

289
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,430
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

290
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,290
詹森交易团听说你故意打输萨特的案子
Jensen Analytics heard a rumor you tanked Sutter's case

291
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,660
威胁说要解约
and they're threatening to walk.

292
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,850
该死  你怎么说的
Shit. What'd you tell them?

293
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,490
你觉得我还能怎么说
What do you think I told them?

294
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,230
我说威廉・萨特是个满口谎话的混蛋
I told them William Sutter's a lying son of a bitch

295
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,660
为达目的不择手段口不择言
who'll do or say anything to get what he wants.

296
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,440
他们怎么说
What did they say?

297
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,080
他们说如果杰西卡最老的委托人都离开
They said if Jessica's oldest client's leaving,

298
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,240
他们又有什么理由留下
why should they stay?

299
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,670
该死
Goddamn it.

300
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,540
哈维  如果他们这么想了  那我们
Harvey, if they think that, then it's just a matter of time

301
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,450
其他委托人会这么想也只是时间问题
until all our clients think that.

302
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,860
也就是说我们必须保住吉姆・雷诺兹
Which means we need to get Jim Reynolds to stay.

303
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,960
怎么跟杰西卡说
What're we gonna tell Jessica?

304
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,330
我们跟她说如果她再不处理雷诺兹的事
We're gonna tell her if she doesn't do something

305
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,510
她很快也就没有一个公司
about Reynolds soon, she's not gonna have a firm

306
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,030
可以回了
to come back to.

307
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,330
瑞秋  听着  这已经是最好的结果了
Rachel, listen to me, it went as well as it could've.

308
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,090
你不用这么忧虑
You don't have to look so worried.

309
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,460
我怎么可能不忧虑
How can I not look worried?

310
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,160
迈克  那个女人直接说认为他有罪
Mike, that woman said that she thought he was guilty

311
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,950
而且这句话还成了检方证据
and the prosecutor got it on record.

312
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,240
杰西卡在这之前就证明了
And Jessica got it on record that she was incompetent

313
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,470
她的失职
before he did that.

314
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,320
陪审团知道的
The jury heard it.

315
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,230
是啊  但是你也看到了陪审团的样子
Yeah, but you saw the jury as well as I did.

316
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,950
他们并不信
They're not convinced.

317
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,050
让伦纳德作证
Put Leonard on the stand.

318
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,700
迈克  我们还没教他对答呢
Mike, we haven't prepped him yet.

319
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,430
-他还没准备  -瑞秋  听我说
- He's not ready. - Rachel, just listen to me.

320
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,340
我上庭时
When I was on trial,

321
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,690
不仅是给了陪审团一个释放我的理由
I didn't just give the jury a reason to let me go.

322
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,270
而是给了他们一个想释放你的理由
You gave them a reason to want to let you go.

323
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,290
没错  而且他们也如我所愿了
Exactly, and it turns out, they were going to.

324
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,320
而且我还是有罪的
And I was guilty.

325
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,400
那你觉得他们面对一个本身就无罪的人
What do you think they're gonna do for a man

326
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,280
会怎么做呢
who's actually innocent?

327
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,860
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

328
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,790
我需要见你
I needed to see you.

329
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,560
我也是
Me too.

330
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,180
今天过得真糟
Had a rough day.

331
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,080
还得到了坏消息
Got some bad news.

332
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,970
见到你真是让人心情好转
You're a sight for sore eyes.

333
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,470
路易
Louis...

334
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,090
怎么了
What's wrong?

335
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,420
我今天去看了医生
I had a doctor's appointment this morning.

336
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,850
不管什么病  我们都共同面对
Well, whatever it is, we can deal with it together.

337
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,210
现代医学很厉害的
Modern medicine is a wonder.

338
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,650
-基本没有无法治愈的  -我怀孕了
- There's almost nothing that they can't-- - I'm pregnant.

339
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,470
天哪
Oh, my God.

340
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,990
我虽然知道自己很厉害
I mean, I knew the Litt sperm were powerful,

341
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,580
-但是这也太快了  -路易
- but this has to be some kind of record. - Louis.

342
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,250
不会吧
Don't tell me.

343
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,210
-是他的  -路易  我真的很抱歉
- It's his. - Louis, I'm so sorry.

344
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,360
我并不想这样的
I didn't mean for this to happen.

345
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,500
-我一向很谨慎  -我不在乎
- I'm usually so careful. - I don't care.

346
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,920
路易  我觉得你不知道自己在说什么
Louis, I don't think you know what you're saying.

347
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,740
不  我很清楚自己在说什么
No, I know exactly what I'm saying.

348
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,840
我爱你
I love you.

349
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,670
如果跟你在一起意味着要养别人的孩子
And if being with you means raising another man's child,

350
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,170
那我就养个别人的孩子
then I'll raise another man's child.

351
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,620
你现在是这么说了  但你会后悔的
You say that now, but it hasn't sunk in yet.

352
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,510
不会的
That's not true.

353
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,940
我明天也会这么说
I'm gonna say the same thing tomorrow

354
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,540
后天大后天还会这么说
and the day after that and the day after that.

355
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,780
到了那时候你再说吧
Then say it to me then.

356
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,910
但今天我们都很累了
But it has been a long day for both of us,

357
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,640
我想我们都需要休息
and I think we should both just get some sleep.

358
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,650
塔拉  跟我回家吧
Tara, please come home with me.

359
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,360
晚安  路易
Good night, Louis.

360
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,280
杰西卡  我们有麻烦了
Jessica, we have a problem.

361
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,150
马上要下班我可不想听到这句话  哈维
Not what I want to hear on my way out, Harvey.

362
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,880
那你肯定不想知道你必须出席
Then you're not gonna want to hear that you need to be at

363
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,760
吉姆・雷诺兹的下场董事会
Jim Reynolds' next board meeting.

364
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,310
听起来你好像没解决问题
That doesn't sound like you put out the fire.

365
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,030
我没解决的是关于我们故意损害
What I couldn't put out were the rumors

366
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,120
萨特的案子以交换迈克的流言
that we threw Sutter's case to get Mike out.

367
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,760
逗我呢吗  原来是因为这个
Are you kidding me? That's what this is about?

368
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,260
杰西卡  不是吉姆想解约
Jessica, it's not Jim.

369
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,910
他很忠诚  一直如此
He's loyal and always has been.

370
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,420
我猜猜  是唐纳德・曼尼斯
Don't tell me. It's Donald Mannis

371
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,840
利用此事挤兑对手
using this shit as a power play.

372
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,690
没错  而且我直接中招了
Exactly. And I walked right into it,

373
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,350
因为你没有跟我一起去
because I showed up without you.

374
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,180
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

375
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,090
杰西卡  现在我们只能保住雷诺兹
Jessica, the only thing we can do is hold onto Reynolds

376
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,310
然后祈祷其他人不解约
and hope the others fall in line.

377
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,590
好吧  安排周二的会议
All right, set up a meeting for Tuesday morning.

378
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,290
那时候案子应该会结了
The trial should be over by then.

379
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,970
但是哈维  如果萨特继续这样散播谣言
But Harvey, it won't make a bit of difference

380
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,370
说我们是故意损害案子的律师
if Sutter's out there telling the world

381
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,750
那开会也不会有多大改变的
we're the kind of lawyers that throw cases.

382
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,070
不管怎么做  你想办法让他闭嘴
You do what you have to-- you shut that man the hell up.

383
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,160
他是谁
Who's he?

384
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,870
伦纳德  这是我未婚夫  迈克
Leonard, this is my fiancé, Mike.

385
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,530
他曾在我们公司工作  现在他有个主意
He used to work at the firm and he has an idea.

386
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,910
让伦纳德说出自己的故事
Let Leonard tell his story.

387
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,900
太冒险
That's risky.

388
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,290
我们这是在给他们机会把他粉饰成
We're giving them the chance to paint him

389
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,070
一位瘾君子和罪犯
as a drug user and a criminal.

390
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,410
他们已经在这么做了
They're already doing that.

391
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,970
而且他们不会就此停止
And they're not gonna stop.

392
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,380
伦纳德  你和我们有同样的决定权
Leonard, this is as much your call as it is ours.

393
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,750
你希望怎么做
What do you want to do?

394
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,470
我上次就想说出自己的心里话
I wanted to say my piece last time,

395
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,590
但那位女士不让我说  所以拜托了
but that lady didn't let me, so please,

396
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,840
让我出庭  给我个说出来的机会吧
put me on that stand and give me a chance to say it now.

397
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,580
好的
Okay.

398
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,900
辩方准备好传唤下一位证人了吗
Is the defense ready to call their next witness?

399
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,270
辩方传唤伦纳德・贝利作证  法官大人
The defense calls Leonard Bailey, Your Honor.

400
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,280
我们同时请求准许赞恩小姐
We'd also like to request that Ms. Zane

401
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,000
对证人进行提问
be permitted to question the witness.

402
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,120
反对  赞恩小姐是位法学院的学生
Objection, Ms. Zane is a law student,

403
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,670
并不是律师协会的一员
not an admitted member of the bar.

404
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,140
她同时也当了八年的
She's also been a practicing paralegal

405
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,270
法律助理
for the last eight years.

406
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,030
就算她是美国总统我也不在乎
I don't care if she was the President of the United States.

407
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,100
她并不是一位律师
She's not a lawyer

408
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,820
而且他们这是在设法促成无效审判
and they're laying grounds for a mistrial.

409
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,290
法官大人  贝利先生的第一位律师
Your Honor, it's obvious Mr. Bailey's first attorney

410
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,000
显然并不在乎他的死活
didn't care about him at all.

411
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,490
但赞恩小姐苦苦争取到了这个案子的重审
But Ms. Zane fought to have this case taken on,

412
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,480
如果不是她我们今天甚至都不会在这里
and she's the reason we're even here today.

413
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,090
正因如此  贝利先生仅仅希望
Which is why Mr. Bailey is simply asking

414
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,810
现在可以由她来为他进行辩护
that she be with him now.

415
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,420
所以除非检方对自己太缺乏自信
So unless the prosecution is so unsure of its case

416
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,500
以至于都搞不定一位法学院学生
that he can't handle a law student,

417
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,150
我们请求准许她对证人进行提问
we ask that she be allowed to question the witness.

418
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,360
检方撤回反对
Prosecution withdraws its objection.

419
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,180
那么你的请求被允许了
Then your request is granted.

420
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,700
哈维
Harvey.

421
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,440
我就觉得你或许会来拜访我
I thought I might get a visit from you.

422
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,390
我不是跟你说过叫你不要多嘴了吗
And I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut.

423
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,640
你出卖我之时我就不再听从你的意见了
Well, I stopped taking advice from you when you sold me out.

424
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,080
在我报警前  立刻从我的地盘上滚出去
Now get the hell off my property before I call the police.

425
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,020
不过这有个问题  威廉
There's only one problem with that, William.

426
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,630
这里不再是你的地盘了
This isn't your property anymore.

427
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,740
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

428
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,360
明早8点
At 8:00 A.M. tomorrow morning,

429
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,150
这处房产就将被政府收走了
it's being seized by the government.

430
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,090
放屁
Bullshit.

431
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,600
这里是宅地状态
This is a homestead state.

432
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,920
实际上呢  我做了些调查
Turns out, I did a little checking,

433
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,500
在你卖掉上一处房产前你就买下了这里
and you closed on this house before you sold the last one,

434
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,620
也就意味着他们能  也会收走这处房产
which means they can take it and they're going to.

435
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,670
你想怎么样
What do you want?

436
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,280
你得恢复我的声誉
You're gonna repair my reputation.

437
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,080
而你的第一步是
And you're gonna start by

438
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,870
给吉姆・雷诺兹的每一位董事会成员
calling every member of Jim Reynolds' board

439
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,420
打电话告知他们  你之所以造谣我
and telling them that you spread those rumors about me

440
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,380
是因为你是个满嘴谎言的混蛋
because you're a lying son of a bitch.

441
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,930
你为什么觉得他们会相信我
And what makes you think they'll believe me?

442
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,570
因为当你有动力的时候  威廉
Because you're a hell of a salesman, William,

443
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,400
你可是个超棒的销售
when you're motivated,

444
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,180
而我相当确定当你刑满出狱
and I'm pretty sure that when you get out of prison,

445
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,470
你会非常有动力不让自己露宿街头的
you're gonna be motivated not to live on the street.

446
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,700
我当时和我朋友玛利亚嗑药嗑嗨了
I was getting high with my friend Maria.

447
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,270
我并不否认
I won't deny that.

448
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,310
但我对那些孩子们  只有帮助的心
But all I did to those kids was try and help them.

449
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,490
帮他们什么
Help them how?

450
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,030
当时我和玛利亚饿了  所以出去找吃的
Me and Maria got hungry so we went to get something to eat.

451
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,450
就在那个时候我们看到了他们
That's when we saw them.

452
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,380
躺在人行道上
Lying there on the sidewalk...

453
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,860
全身都是血
with blood all over 'em.

454
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,810
玛利亚  她  她吓坏了
Maria, she, uh... she freaked out,

455
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,690
但我当时想都没想  所以我就跑上前去
but I wasn't thinking, so I just ran up.

456
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,350
我是说  他们是孩子啊  你知道吗
I mean, they were kids, you know?

457
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,800
他们  他们有麻烦了
They--they were in trouble.

458
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,670
然后发生了什么
So then what happened?

459
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,560
我叫玛利亚去找人来帮忙
Well, I yelled for Maria to get help.

460
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,350
但那个男孩
But the boy...

461
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,890
他已经断气了
he was already gone.

462
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,030
而那个女孩  一直在不停地喊救命
And the girl, she just kept asking for help,

463
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,270
一遍又一遍
over and over.

464
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,510
我留在那里陪她
I stayed with her.

465
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,980
然后警察就来了
And then the police came.

466
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,500
紧接着
And the next thing you know,

467
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,420
我就被控犯下了谋杀罪
I was being charged with murder.

468
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,460
伦纳德
Leonard...

469
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,000
你入狱前已经结婚了  对吗
you were married before you went to prison, weren't you?

470
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,600
我妻子  在我入狱两年后离开了我
My wife, she left me two years after I went away.

471
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,250
她说她再也忍受不了了
She said she couldn't handle it anymore.

472
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,440
那你的孩子们呢
And what about your children?

473
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,810
你还能见到他们吗
Do you still see them?

474
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,610
我已经十年多没见过我儿子了
I haven't seen my son in over ten years.

475
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,790
而直到你找到我女儿  告诉她我是无辜的
And I hadn't seen Maya until you found her

476
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,460
并且你会证明这一点
and told her I was innocent

477
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,930
我才见到了玛雅
and you were going to prove it.

478
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,100
她就坐在那边
That's her right there.

479
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,770
伦纳德  你有什么话想对她说的吗
Leonard, is there something that you would like to say to her?

480
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,050
我因未行之罪失去了12年的时光
I lost 12 years for a crime I didn't commit.

481
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,810
但如果最终我能
But I won't regret any of it

482
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,130
洗脱罪名并和你团聚的话
if it ends up being the thing

483
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,430
我对之前的一切一点都不后悔
that got me clean and reunited with you.

484
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,850
因为如果我
Because if I died

485
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,140
在你相信你父亲犯了这样的罪的情况下死去
with you believing your father did this...

486
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,420
她不这么想的
She doesn't think that.

487
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,170
她知道你没有伤害那些孩子
She knows that you didn't hurt those kids.

488
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,780
我没有问题了  法官大人
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

489
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,970
法官大人  我们保留
Your Honor, we reserve the right

490
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,820
盘诘被告的权利
to cross examine the defendant.

491
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,190
但现在  既然他声称他知道
But for now, since he's claiming he knows

492
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,390
作为一位悲伤的父亲是什么样的心情
what it feels like to be an aggrieved father,

493
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,010
我希望传唤维克托・福雷斯特出庭作证
I'd like to call Victor Forrest to the stand.

494
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,130
感谢你愿意作证  福雷斯特先生
Thank you for agreeing to do this, Mr. Forrest.

495
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,840
我知道这对于你来说一定很不容易
I know how difficult it must be for you.

496
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,280
你能跟我们说说你女儿吗
Would you mind telling us a little bit about your daughter?

497
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,500
我该怎么说呢
What can I say?

498
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,890
金是我们的一切  她可爱  善良
Kim was our everything-- she was sweet, kind.

499
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,430
很有幽默感
Incredible sense of humor.

500
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,120
她还踢足球  对吗
She played soccer, didn't she?

501
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,390
我以前常去看着她在球场上奔跑
Used to watch her run up and down the field.

502
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,820
乐此不疲  她就一直奔跑着
Never got tired, she just kept running,

503
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,340
大大的笑容写在她脸上
big smile on her face.

504
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,860
她的笑容是如此美丽
She had such a beautiful smile.

505
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,200
显然你非常爱她
It's obvious you loved her very much.

506
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,680
我不仅仅爱她  我试图保护她
I didn't just love her. I tried to protect her.

507
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,620
我警告她要小心那些男孩子
I warned her about boys.

508
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,690
以及毒品
Drugs.

509
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,800
而且我跟她说"有任何麻烦
And I said, "If you're ever in trouble,

510
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,950
打电话给我"
you call me."

511
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,690
而最让我难过的是
And the thing that gets me is,

512
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,750
她那晚确实打电话给我了
she did call that night.

513
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,380
并非因为她碰到了麻烦
Not to say she was in trouble.

514
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,710
而是告诉我她就要回来了
To say she was coming home.

515
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,610
但她最终没能回来
But she never did make it home.

516
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,230
是  而且我也不管那瘾君子作证要说什么
No, and I don't care what some junkie witness was gonna say.

517
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,120
他们发现那个畜生就站在我女儿的身边
They found that animal standing over my little girl's body.

518
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,870
他身上满是我女儿的鲜血
Her blood all over him.

519
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,830
他一夜之间夺走了我的一切
He took away my everything in one night.

520
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,680
而他这么做不过是为了换钱嗑更多药
And he did it for money to buy more drugs.

521
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,510
那你对他对陪审团说的那番话有什么感想
And how do you feel about the speech he gave to the jury?

522
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,020
他说希望能给他和他家人第二次机会
He talked about getting a second chance with his family.

523
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,750
那我的家人呢
What about my family?

524
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,390
我们的生活在那晚彻底崩塌
Our lives were ruined that night.

525
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,660
我的女儿连第一次机会都没有
My little girl never even got a first chance.

526
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,240
我没有问题了  法官大人
No further questions, Your Honor.

527
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,500
福雷斯特先生
Mr. Forrest...

528
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,380
你亲眼看到伦纳德・贝利杀死你女儿了吗
Did you actually see Leonard Bailey kill your daughter?

529
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,730
没有  但这并不代表
Of course I didn't, but that doesn't mean--

530
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,890
我没有问题了  法官大人
No further questions, Your Honor.

531
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,910
唐娜  能给我一分钟吗
Donna, can I talk to you for a second?

532
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,200
既然你那么诚恳
Well, since you asked so nicely,

533
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,510
我可以给你两分钟
I'll even give you two.

534
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,120
我要告诉路易一个坏消息
I have some bad news I have to give Louis,

535
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,910
然而我和他好不容易和好
and since he and I are finally in a good place...

536
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,060
你想知道怎么做才能又告诉他消息
You want to know how to break it to him

537
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,590
又不会再次和他闹翻
without blowing things up again.

538
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,490
知我莫若你
Yeah.

539
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,410
坏消息是有多坏
How bad is it?

540
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,000
很不好
It's not good.

541
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,810
那就和你刚刚和我说的那样说给他
Then do what you just did with me.

542
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,510
带着诚意去找他  开门见山直白的说
Approach him with respect, pull the Band-Aid off,

543
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,200
并且如果你那时的表情和现在
and if you have that same look on your face

544
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,490
一模一样的话
as you do right now,

545
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,560
他会以礼相待的
he'll send you on your way with a handshake.

546
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,840
感谢建议  唐纳
Thanks, Donna.

547
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,730
斯图
Stu?

548
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,790
很高兴和你们公用办公室
It was nice having you here.

549
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,550
怎么了
What?

550
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,920
你真该看看你今天吓跑肯迪克的威武样子
You should've seen yourself thunder away at Kendrick today.

551
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,610
你太帅啦
You were amazing.

552
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,870
而且如果我是道森或者唐尼的话
And if I were Dawson or Downey

553
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,260
而且我必须在你和你父亲之间
and I had to choose between you and your father

554
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,860
选择一个为我辩护的话
to represent me on this,

555
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,230
一周的每天我都会选你
I'd choose you any day of the week

556
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,980
周日更会加倍想选你
and twice on Sunday.

557
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,340
你到底在说啥
What're you talking about?

558
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,520
《义海雄风》啊
I'm talking about "A Few Good Men."

559
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,790
迈克  我现在没空和你扯电影梗
Mike, I don't have time for movie quotes right now.

560
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,710
瑞秋  我不是要和你逗趣扯电影梗
I'm not trying to quote a movie, Rachel,

561
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,180
我只是想告诉你无论那女生的父亲说什么
I'm trying to tell you that it doesn't matter

562
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,580
都不用理
what that girl's father said.

563
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,790
你还在这个案子里
You're still in this,

564
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,540
而且你在庭上的表现好赞
and you were great up there.

565
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,410
等下  你说她父亲
Wait a minute, her father.

566
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,420
他怎么了
What about him?

567
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,000
他说玛利亚是个瘾君子证人
He called Maria a junkie witness.

568
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,470
他怎么会连她嗑药的事情都知道呢
How would he even know that she was a drug user?

569
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,790
你在说什么呀  跟我一样啊
What do you mean? The same way I would know.

570
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,040
伦纳德和他的公诉人在法庭上都这么说了
Leonard and his public defender said so on the stand.

571
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,780
不是  当他找我说让我别再管这件事时
No, but he used those exact words when he came at me

572
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,170
用了一模一样的词
trying to get me to drop this whole thing.

573
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,940
-他找过你  -没事  我对付过去了
- He came at you? - It's fine, I handled it.

574
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,960
但他确实试图恐吓我来着
But he did try to intimidate me.

575
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,590
而一个恐吓了你的人
And a man who would intimidate you

576
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,490
很可能也对玛丽亚做过同样的事
might do the same thing to Maria Gomez.

577
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,150
是  但我觉得他没有恐吓他
Yeah, but I don't think he intimidated her.

578
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,720
我想他应该是做了相反的举动
I think he did the opposite.

579
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,570
你在说什么
What're you saying?

580
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,930
我是说我觉得我们去拜访一下他吧
I'm saying I think we need to pay that man a visit.

581
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,290
路易  有时间吗
Louis, do you have a minute?

582
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,170
实话实说  斯图
Tell you the truth, Stu,

583
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,550
我现在很忙
I kind of have a full plate right now,

584
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,210
所以除非事关生死
so unless it's a matter of life and death,

585
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,330
不然你就等等吧
I'd rather it wait.

586
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,280
这事不能等
This can't wait.

587
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,100
我们得搬走了
We have to move out.

588
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,670
你说的搬走是什么意思
What do you mean, "Move out"?

589
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,770
就是我们要搬迁办公室了
We're relocating.

590
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,300
我想亲自和你讲
I wanted to tell you in person

591
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,470
免得伤害感情
so there's no hard feelings.

592
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,910
扯淡  你不能搬走啊
Oh, bullshit, you can't do this.

593
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,180
路易  我别无选择
Louis, I don't have a choice.

594
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,390
萨特两天前破产了
Sutter went bankrupt two days ago,

595
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,220
而法律上我们公司是属于他们的
and they owed us under their contract.

596
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
他们要我们搬到他们的办公室减轻债务
They're offering us their space to cover their obligations

597
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,330
而明天之前我必须答应他们
and I have to say yes by tomorrow.

598
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,220
如果不是我们你们都不会有这义务
You wouldn't even have those obligations, Stu,

599
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,380
斯图
if it weren't for us.

600
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,750
我知道  但我不能和我的老板们说
I know that, but I can't tell my bosses

601
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,420
就因为你们帮了我个忙
I'm passing on a fortune in free rent

602
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,490
我就要拒绝免费办公室
'cause you guys did me a solid.

603
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,530
那你告诉他们你都签了租赁协议了
Well, then you tell them you have a lease

604
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,450
中途退租我就告你
and I'm gonna sue your goddamn ass.

605
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,370
路易  租赁协议有个条款是
Louis, there's a clause in the lease

606
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,890
30天内可退租  你知道的
that gives me a 30-day out and you know it.

607
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,930
斯图  拜托了
Stu, please.

608
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,580
你现在不能这么做啊
You cannot do this to us now.

609
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,550
-至少今晚不行  -抱歉  路易
- Not tonight. - I'm sorry, Louis.

610
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,640
我真的不想害你们  如果
I hate to hang you out to dry

611
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,400
我有别的办法帮忙  我一定会的
and if I could help you in another way, I would.

612
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,050
但是我们真的不能再租这个地方了
But we can't rent this space.

613
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,860
我们没什么好讲
I have nothing to say to you.

614
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,760
拜托  福勒斯特  我不想跟你说话时
Please, Mr. Forrest, you confronted me

615
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,780
你还是质问了我
when I didn't want to talk to you,

616
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,970
而且我也尊重你  听你说完了话
and I gave you the respect to hear what you had to say.

617
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,990
至少您也给予相同的尊重听我们把话说完
You can at least hear what we have to say.

618
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,930
给你们60秒  然后我就叫警察了
You got 60 seconds, then I'm calling the police.

619
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,940
尽管报警  当他们到的时候
Go ahead, but when they get here,

620
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,050
我们就告诉他们你送走了玛利亚・戈麦斯
we'll tell them all about how you sent Maria Gomez away

621
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,550
导致她无法作证
so that she couldn't testify.

622
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,190
-你们在说什么胡话  -是乱讲吗
- That's insane. - Is it?

623
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,800
因为一个从未被法庭记录为瘾君子的证人
Because a woman who was never in the court record as a drug user

624
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,100
去了她绝无可能负担得起的戒毒所
went to a rehab facility she could never afford

625
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,030
而你对她熟悉到1个月前
and you know enough about her

626
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,280
就当我面叫她吸毒者
to call her a druggie to my face a month ago.

627
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,590
这无法证明任何事情
That's not proof of anything.

628
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,500
如果你是无辜的也不会这么接我们的话
And that's not the answer of an innocent man.

629
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,360
福雷斯特先生
Look, Mr. Forrest,

630
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,790
您所承担的巨大痛苦我都无法想象
I can't begin to understand what you've been through,

631
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,490
但现在因为您的所做作为
but right now, the wrong man is sitting on death row

632
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,750
一个无辜的人成了死囚
because of what you did.

633
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,470
-我什么也没做  -拜托你了
- I didn't do shit. - Please.

634
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,680
你就不能想想伦纳德・贝利经历了什么吗
Can't you imagine what this has been like for Leonard Bailey,

635
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,830
他过去的12年里所遭受的吗
what his life has looked like for the past 12 years?

636
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,790
我唯一想去想象的
The only thing I want to imagine

637
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,820
就是那个男人咽下他最后一口气之后
is what my life's gonna be like

638
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,950
我的生活该有的样子
after that man takes his final breath.

639
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,640
你们的时间到了
Your time is up.

640
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,540
路易  你没事吧
Louis, is everything okay?

641
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,120
什么意思
What do you mean?

642
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,670
我的意思是我知道斯图的事了
I mean, I saw what happened with Stu.

643
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,670
我知道他要离开  但一切都会好起来的
I know he's leaving, but it's gonna be okay.

644
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,310
哈维会搞定吉姆・雷诺兹的事
Harvey's gonna fix things with Jim Reynolds,

645
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,230
我们会找到更多的客户
we're gonna get more clients--

646
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,360
塔拉怀孕了
Tara's pregnant.

647
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,680
孩子不是我的
It's not mine.

648
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,960
那你跟她说了什么
What did you tell her?

649
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,260
我告诉她我要和她在一起
I told her I'm going to stay with her

650
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,860
并且尽力支持她
and support her every way I can,

651
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,350
因为我爱她
because I'm in love with her.

652
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,280
她怎么说的
And what did she say?

653
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,390
她说我们需要先冷静一下
She said we need to sleep on it

654
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,960
因为我会后悔
because it hasn't sunk in for me.

655
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,600
那你为什么这么沮丧呢
Then what were you so upset about?

656
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,480
要是她说这些话
What if she's saying that

657
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,500
是因为她不知道该做什么那怎么办呢
because she can't decided what she's gonna do?

658
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,450
-路易  -我怎么知道她不会一早起来
- Louis-- - How do I know she didn't wake up this morning

659
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,880
就决定回去找他呢
and decide to run back to him?

660
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,200
事情不是这样的
That's not what's going on.

661
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,720
这是一个重大决定
This is a huge decision

662
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,560
她想要确定
and she wants to make sure

663
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,940
你这样决定不是一时冲动
that you're in it for the long haul.

664
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,520
唐娜  我言出必行不会反悔的
Donna, I would never go back on my word.

665
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,030
你以前没少反悔而且你也清楚
That's not true and you know it.

666
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,340
你总是喜欢冲动之下
You make impulsive decisions

667
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,930
做出决定然后又反悔
and you go back on them all the time.

668
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,960
-那不一样  -怎么不一样
- This is different. - How?

669
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,230
因为这事关孩子
Because it's a baby.

670
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,510
我不会这么对待孩子的
I would never do that to a baby.

671
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,100
我相信你  但我的意思是
I hear you, but all I'm saying is,

672
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,670
不要匆忙决定
don't do something rash.

673
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,240
因为这种事不是你想反悔就可以反悔的
Because this isn't something you can change your mind about.

674
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,570
你们逗我呢吧
You got to be kidding.

675
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,930
你们瞒着我去见受害人的父亲
You went to see the victim's father without telling me?

676
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,360
杰西卡  这件事不能等我们必须弄清楚
Jessica, we didn't have time and we had to know.

677
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,290
就像你教给哈维  哈维又教给我的那样
And like you taught Harvey and Harvey taught me,

678
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,100
事后求原谅比事前求允许要好的多
it's better to ask forgiveness than permission.

679
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,540
你不是要求我这些
You're not asking for either one.

680
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,650
你是在要求我在公开法庭
You're asking me to accuse the man

681
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,800
控告这个男人妨碍司法公正
of obstruction of justice in open court.

682
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,430
杰西卡  我们在他的眼神里看到了真相
Jessica, we looked the man in the eye,

683
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,180
我发誓  就是他做的
and I'm telling you, he did it.

684
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,290
我不在乎他有没有做过
I don't give a shit if he did it or not.

685
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,070
我们根本无法证明他做过
There's no way on the planet we can prove it.

686
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,020
只要你在出庭时戳穿他就不需要证明
We don't have to prove it if you can break him on the stand.

687
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,400
你是不是疯了呀
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

688
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,870
-这是唯一的办法  -这不是
- It's the only way-- - It's not the only way.

689
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,230
-我也不打算如此  -你到底在怕什么
- And I'm not doing it. - What're you so afraid of?

690
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,400
你居然敢对我说这句话
Don't you dare say that to me.

691
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,290
那个男人的命掌握在我的手里
That man's life is in my hands

692
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,680
而且就是因为你未婚妻告诉他不要交易
because your fiancée told him not to take the deal.

693
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,550
要是我们攻击受害人父亲又适得其反
And if we attack the father and it backfires,

694
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,440
我们会完全失去陪审团的信任而他也就完了
we lose the jury for good and his life is over.

695
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,280
杰西卡  这个家伙想告诉人们真相
Jessica, this guy wants to tell everyone the truth

696
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,970
因为他为此骄傲
because he's proud of it.

697
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,980
你只需要引导他说出他想说的话
You just need to lead him right where he's dying to go.

698
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,570
如果我做不到呢
And what if I can't do that?

699
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,260
迈克有个主意
Mike has something that might help.

700
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,120
你说的是什么
What're you talking about?

701
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,510
我想问你看过《义海雄风》吗
I'm asking if you've seen the movie "A Few Good Men."

702
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,250
唐娜  你在这做什么
Donna, what're you doing here?

703
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,140
等你啊
Waiting for you.

704
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,520
因为我给你打了电话发了短信
Because I've been calling you and texting you

705
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,030
很明显你就没看手机
and you obviously haven't checked your phone.

706
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,990
我没看手机
I haven't checked my phone

707
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,110
是因为我去拜访了我们的每一位客户
because I've been going to every client

708
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,440
向他们保证
we have reassuring them

709
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,950
萨特会收回他说的胡话
that Sutter's gonna recant his bullshit

710
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,140
并且吉姆・雷诺兹不会离开
and Jim Reynolds isn't going anywhere.

711
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,460
如果你不尽快采取措施
Yeah, well, if you don't do something soon,

712
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,510
你就得收回你刚说的话了
you're gonna have to recant that.

713
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,550
你到底在说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

714
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,490
吉姆・雷诺兹之前打来电话
Jim Reynolds called.

715
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,340
他们把董事会改到明天了
They moved his board meeting to tomorrow.

716
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,470
-我们需要谈谈  -真是难以置信
- We need to talk. - I don't believe this.

717
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,370
我马上要进行我人生中最重要的盘诘
I'm about to give the most important cross examination in my life

718
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,440
你们居然选这个时刻突然出现
and you're showing up now?

719
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,240
杰西卡  我们给你留了十几条留言
Jessica, we left you a dozen messages.

720
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,790
吉姆・雷诺兹的董事提前了董事会
Jim Reynolds' board moved up the meeting.

721
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,200
那就告诉他们延后因为我现在去不了
Then tell them to push it back because I can't go right now.

722
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,420
该死  你还不明白吗
Goddamn it, don't you get it?

723
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,060
他们提前开会就是为了能尽快结束
They moved it up so they can get it over with.

724
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,940
他们要炒掉雷诺兹还有我们
They're gonna fire Reynolds and they're fire us.

725
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,580
而他说的很清楚你一定要出席
And he made it clear that you need to be there.

726
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,930
杰西卡  路易说的没错
Jessica, Louis is right.

727
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,880
如果你不和我们一起出席
If we show up without you,

728
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,890
那我们去了也是白去
we may as well not show up at all.

729
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,730
辩方律师准备好发问了吗
Is the defense ready to proceed?

730
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,320
法官大人  我想申请半天的延期审理
Your Honor, I'd like to ask for a half-day continuance.

731
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,410
基于什么理由
On what grounds?

732
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,480
事关我律所的生死存亡
It has to do with my law firm's survival.

733
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,580
那就让她的同事接管半天
Then let her associate take the reins for half a day.

734
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,660
她还没做好这个准备
She's not ready for this.

735
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,880
她倒是为别的事准备的挺好
Well, she was ready for the other thing.

736
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,170
那并不一样  检方也很清楚
That was different and the prosecution knows it.

737
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,320
我知道的是你的律所发生的事
What I know is whatever's happening with your firm

738
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,670
不是我该管的
is not my concern.

739
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,330
所以要么让你的助手盘诘
So either let your associate handle this

740
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,500
要么你来
or handle it yourself.

741
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,570
但案子要照常审理
But this case is moving forward.

742
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,730
你们尽力办吧
Do whatever you can.

743
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:59,300
我不能为了他们的权力斗争而放弃伦纳德
I'm not abandoning Leonard to some corporate power struggle.

744
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,140
这不是什么权力斗争
This isn't a goddamn power struggle.

745
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,650
我们的公司要倒闭了
We're gonna go out of business.

746
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,220
我现在没空想这些  路易
I can't think about that right now, Louis.

747
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,090
那个男人命悬一线
That man's life is on the line,

748
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,710
我不能袖手旁观
and I'm not hanging him out to dry.

749
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,470
皮尔逊女士  你准备好开始了吗
Ms. Pearson, are you ready to proceed?

750
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,750
准备好了  法官大人
We are, Your Honor.

751
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,770
辩方律师想传唤维克多・福雷斯特出庭
Defense would like to recall Victor Forrest to the stand.

752
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,550
杰西卡  真让人意外
Jessica, what a surprise.

753
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,430
你从来没来过我的办公室
You never come to my office.

754
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,320
你什么时候从学校到家的
When did you get home from school?

755
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,400
今天早上
This morning.

756
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,370
我要是早知道你会过来
Oh, if I'd known you were coming--

757
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,380
我不想让你知道  爸爸
I didn't want you to know, Dad.

758
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,000
-我有大消息告诉你  -什么消息
- I have some news. - What is it?

759
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,910
一切还好吗
Is everything okay?

760
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,810
我拿到了明年去哈佛法学院的通知书
I got into Harvard Law next year.

761
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,930
-而且我也想要去  -什么
- And I'm going. - What?

762
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,730
我想成为一名律师
I'm going to be a lawyer.

763
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,100
那你当医生的计划呢
What happened to our plan of you becoming surgeon?

764
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,410
那不是我们的计划  爸爸  只是你的
That was never our plan, Dad. It was always yours.

765
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,890
不许这么跟我说话
Don't you speak to me like that.

766
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,510
我没怎么跟你说话
I'm not speaking to you like anything.

767
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,650
我只是在说事实
I'm telling you the truth.

768
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,940
你想要事实
You want the truth?

769
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,950
医生可以治病救人  而律师不过是
Doctors save lives and lawyers are nothing but

770
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,330
渴望权力的底层
power-hungry bottom-feeders.

771
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,040
律师不一定就如此  而且我绝不会如此
They don't have to be and I'm not going to be.

772
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,750
-我教给你的东西更好  -不  爸爸
- And I raised you better. - No, Dad.

773
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,020
你教我做能激励我的事
You raised me to do what inspires me.

774
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,440
而能激励我的事情  就是做名律师
And what inspires me is to be a lawyer.

775
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,050
你去那所学校
You go to that school,

776
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,950
就会染上他们的律师思维
you're gonna get infected with their lawyer mind-set

777
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,620
等你出来
and when you come out,

778
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,060
就会不在乎自己的同胞
you're not gonna give a shit about your fellow man.

779
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,250
如果你真这么想
If you think that,

780
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,810
那你应该再多花点时间跟我相处
then you should've spent more time with me.

781
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,230
因为你一点都不了解我
Because you don't know me at all.

782
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,240
皮尔逊女士
Ms. Pearson?

783
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,390
皮尔逊女士  你准备好了吗
Ms. Pearson, are you ready?

784
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,410
福雷斯特先生
Mr. Forrest...

785
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,340
那一晚许多人的生活都被毁掉了
so many lives were ruined that night.

786
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,830
你女儿的  她男友的  还有你的
Your daughter's, her boyfriend's, yours.

787
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,900
这是个问题吗
Is there a question?

788
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,760
总得有人为其付出代价  不是吗
Someone had to pay for that, didn't they?

789
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,260
该付出代价的人也付了
Yeah, they sure as hell did.

790
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,880
所以你付钱给玛利亚・戈麦斯
Is that why you paid for Maria Gomez

791
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,210
让她去戒毒所  致使她无法出庭
to go to rehab to keep her from testifying

792
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,930
为贝利先生的审判作证吗
at Mr. Bailey's trial?

793
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,600
-什么  -反对  法官大人
- What? - Objection, Your Honor,

794
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,270
她在让受害者受审
she's putting the victim on trial.

795
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,220
我当事人才是受害者
My client is the victim here.

796
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,820
皮尔逊女士  你最好尽快提出证据
Ms. Pearson, you better back this up fast.

797
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,470
那就让证人回答我的问题
Then ask the witness to answer my question.

798
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,520
我昨天之前都没听说过那女人的名字
I never even heard of that woman until yesterday.

799
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,850
法官大人  辩方申请提交证据
Your Honor, the defense would like to admit into evidence

800
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,230
是艾莉森・多布森12年前
the admissions form for an Allison Dobsen

801
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,330
进入路径康复中心的申请表
into the Pathways Rehabilitation Center from 12 years ago.

802
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,240
那是...谁
Wha--who is that?

803
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,690
她是玛利亚・戈麦斯的室友
She was Maria Gomez's roommate.

804
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,990
我会让她出庭作证
And I'm gonna put her on the stand.

805
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,890
不  你不能那么做
No, that's can't be. No--you can't do that.

806
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,030
她会作证玛利亚曾告诉她
And she's going to say that Maria told her

807
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,520
自己为抛弃朋友感到羞愧
that she felt terrible about abandoning her friend.

808
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,370
-反对  传闻证据  -不  她不会的
- Objection, hearsay. - No, she won't.

809
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,090
-反对无效  -她还会作证说
- Overruled. - And she's going to testify

810
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,820
是你付钱让玛利亚去那里的
that you paid for Maria to be there.

811
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,020
我什么都没有做
I had nothing to do with anything.

812
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,130
她可不会这么说
That's not what she's going to say.

813
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,900
-我不在乎  她说谎  -她为什么说谎
- I don't care, she's lying. - Why would she lie?

814
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,290
她只想让真相大白
She just wants to put the record straight.

815
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,350
-真相已经大白了  -她室友可不同意
- The record is straight. - Not according to her roommate.

816
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,490
-她在说谎  -反对  纠缠证人
- She's lying! - Objection, badgering.

817
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,750
你怎么知道的呢
How could you know?

818
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,410
因为玛利亚・戈麦斯就没有室友
Because Maria Gomez didn't have a roommate!

819
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,230
你刚刚说什么
What did you just say?

820
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,860
是  我给她钱了
Yes, I paid for her.

821
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,250
因为她是个瘾君子  只要能让他脱罪
Because she's a junkie who'd say anything

822
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,300
她什么话都能说  所以我把她弄走了
to get him out of what he did, so I got her out of the way

823
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,100
因为就是他干的
'cause he did it.

824
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,200
-福雷斯特先生  -就是他干的
- Mr. Forrest-- - He did it!

825
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,360
法官大人
Your Honor...

826
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,340
辩方请求判决贝利先生无罪
the defense asks that Mr. Bailey be exonerated

827
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,250
立即撤销他所有刑期
and his sentence be commuted immediately.

828
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,150
马斯登先生
Mr. Marsden?

829
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,220
我们没有意见  法官大人
We have no objections, Your Honor.

830
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,080
那么陪审团可以解散了
Then the jury may be excused.

831
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,930
贝利先生
And Mr. Bailey...

832
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,740
你自由了
you're free.

833
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,160
我不敢相信
I can't believe it.

834
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,260
我们做到了
We did it.

835
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,950
我们做到了
We did it.

836
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,370
我真的感激不尽
I can't thank you enough.

837
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,670
你不用感激我  伦纳德
You don't have to thank me, Leonard.

838
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,520
你只需要走出那扇门
You just have to walk out that door.

839
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,170
真是次漂亮的盘诘
That was one hell of a cross.

840
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,950
我很想谦虚一下说没什么
Well, I'd like to say it was no big deal,

841
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,730
我一定是在说谎  如果我说这不是
but I'd be lying if I didn't say

842
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,790
我整个职业生涯中最满意的时刻
it was the most satisfying moment of my entire career.

843
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,980
这是什么
What's this?

844
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,090
我接到了吉姆・雷诺兹的电话
Got a call from Jim Reynolds.

845
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,860
她说如果你今天不到场
He said that if you didn't show today,

846
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,470
他们就会跟我签约
they were gonna sign with me.

847
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,240
我们都知道你没出现
And we both know you didn't show.

848
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,210
你想合并
You want to merge?

849
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,140
我说那些关于希望有对手的话
I said all that stuff about rivals

850
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,630
是因为我不想当哈维的面说这些
because I didn't want to say this in front of Harvey.

851
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,440
但我知道你们故意输掉萨特的案子是为了迈克
But I know you tanked the Sutter case for Mike

852
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,060
你为瑞秋做的事我也都看在眼里
and I can see what you've been doing for Rachel.

853
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,520
这不只是职业行为
So this isn't just professional.

854
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,850
对我来说  这是个人恩情
For me, it's personal.

855
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:19,960
-罗伯特  -杰西卡
- Robert-- - Jessica,

856
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,510
你面前有座山要搬
you got to knock down the mountain.

857
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,240
没有帮助  你没法重新站起来
Without help, you're not gonna be able get back up.

858
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,640
拜托你  接受我的帮助吧
Please, take my hand.

859
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,500
我很感谢你的提议
I appreciate your offer

860
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,160
比你想的还要感激  罗伯特
more than you know, Robert.

861
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,700
但我做首席命名合伙人太久了
But I've had my name first for too long.

862
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,020
不能接受我的名字列于他人之后
I can't go back to having it last.

863
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,140
杰西卡  你不这么做
Jessica, if you don't do this,

864
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,750
你的名字就哪里都不存在了
you're not gonna have it anywhere.

865
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,000
那就不在吧
Then so be it.

866
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,470
再说我们都知道  律师不过是
Besides, we both know lawyers are nothing but

867
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,980
渴望权力的底层
power-hungry bottom-feeders, anyway.

868
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,080
你俩谁都不像杰西卡・皮尔逊
You two don't look like Jessica Pearson.

869
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,590
不过这也不重要了
Then again, it doesn't really matter,

870
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,380
因为15分钟后  你们律所就不再
because in 15 minutes, your firm is no longer going to be

871
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,560
受雇于这家公司了
in the employ of this company.

872
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,320
或许是
Maybe not.

873
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,830
但在我们还受雇于它之时
But while we are,

874
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,790
我认为你需要加把椅子
I think you're gonna need one more chair.

875
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,810
你们在说什么
What're you talking about?

876
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,720
我们在说你们最新的股权人
We're talking about your brand new largest shareholder.

877
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,030
什么股权人
What shareholder?

878
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,120
各位  我是斯图・布齐尼
Hey, guy. Stu Buzzini.

879
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,310
这个最头上的椅子看起来挺适合我的
This one at the head of the table looks good to me.

880
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,130
我不管你是谁
Look, I don't care who you are

881
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,380
你买了多少股份
or how many shares you bought.

882
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,930
但你不是这个董事会的成员
You're not a member of this board.

883
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,800
对  但下个季度  我就是了
No, but as of next quarter, I will be.

884
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,630
所以要么你们留下他俩做你们的律师
So either you keep these two as your lawyers

885
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,430
吉姆・雷诺兹做首席执行官
and Jim Reynolds as your CEO,

886
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,620
要么下次会议  你就不是董事了
or at our next meeting, you'll be out on your ass.

887
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,990
你不能这么对我
You can't do this to me.

888
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,180
你错了  唐纳德
That's where you're wrong, Donald.

889
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,900
我们可以  而且已经做了
We can and we did.

890
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,580
因为他刚刚买下了你的公司
Because he just bought up your company

891
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,850
而你惹错了一个大人物
and you messed with the wrong goddamn Marine.

892
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,280
你在说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

893
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,230
是呀  你说什么呢
Yeah, what are you talkin' about?

894
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,090
-他在引用《义海雄风》  -知己啊
- He's quoting "A Few Good Men." - Finally, somebody gets me.

895
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:50,800
我支持你  兄弟
I got your back, bro.

896
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,900
别跟我称兄道弟  伙计
Don't bro me, dude.

897
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,990
-没问题  长官  -我能加入吗
- You got it, Chief. - Hey, can I get in on this?

898
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,170
不行
No.

899
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,720
我给你带了礼物
I got you a present.

900
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,130
你不用这样的
You didn't have to do that.

901
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,170
我知道
I know.

902
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,350
我知道我们不该在那儿拍照
I know we're not supposed to take pictures in there,

903
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,350
但我没忍住
but I couldn't help myself.

904
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,880
太不可思议了
This is unbelievable.

905
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,870
不
No.

906
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,480
你为那个人做的才叫不可思议
What you did for that man is unbelievable.

907
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,040
哈维给了我份工作
Harvey offered me a job.

908
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,040
回律所去
Back to the firm...

909
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,010
做顾问
as a consultant.

910
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,250
你打算怎么做
What are you gonna do?

911
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,460
我不知道
I don't know.

912
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,870
那是什么  茶吗
What is that, a cup of tea?

913
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,400
安静一小会儿  思考一下
Just a moment of quiet reflection.

914
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,630
让安静去死吧
Well, to hell with that.

915
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,350
这是庆祝时刻
This is a moment for celebration.

916
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,470
没错
That's right.

917
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,380
因为今天我们不仅救下一个人的命
'Cause a man's life wasn't the only thing saved today.

918
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,630
我猜猜
Don't tell me.

919
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,250
你们想办法留住了吉姆・雷诺兹
You managed to lock down Jim Reynolds after all.

920
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,340
是的
We did.

921
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,780
律所保住了  杰西卡
The firm is safe, Jessica.

922
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,020
谢谢你们
Thank you.

923
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,980
但这不再是我的律所了
But it's not my firm anymore.

924
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,090
是你们的
It's yours.

925
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,540
什么叫"我们的"
What do you mean, "Ours"?

926
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,840
意思是我已经决定退职了
I mean, I've decided to step down.

927
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,750
-什么  -杰西卡
- What? - Jessica--

928
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,310
这一路走过来
Listen, somewhere along the way,

929
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,210
我已经忘记了自己做律师的初衷
I forgot why I became a lawyer in the first place.

930
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,960
我不是要追求金钱和权力
And it wasn't just to fight for money and power.

931
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,730
而是要为更重要的事奋斗的
It was to fight for something more.

932
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,100
胡说  你这不是要为更重要的东西奋斗
Bullshit, you're not fighting for something more,

933
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,870
你是要逃跑
you're running away.

934
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,490
-路易  -不
- Louis-- - No.

935
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,540
我们累得四脚朝天才救下这家律所
We bust our ass to save this goddamn place,

936
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,730
她就决定放弃然后走人吗
she decides to up and leave?

937
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,930
我们为公司投入了心血的
We committed to this.

938
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,610
路易  她没有对不起你
Louis, she isn't doing this to you.

939
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,820
她是为了对得起自己
She's doing it for herself.

940
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,660
我不管她为什么
I don't give a shit why she's doing it.

941
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,790
这是极度自私的行为  这不能发生
It's selfish and self-serving and it's not gonna happen.

942
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,090
你以为我想这么做吗  路易
Do you think I want to goddamn want do this, Louis?

943
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,370
我别无选择
I have to do this.

944
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,790
我们刚把它们救回来
You can't just throw this all away

945
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,240
你不能就这么抛下一切
after we gave everything to save it.

946
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,460
够了
That's enough.

947
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,970
路易  在合伙人离开前
Louis, after the partners left,

948
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,700
我们发誓要贡献最后一点力量
we swore we were gonna dedicate every ounce of blood, sweat,

949
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,590
无论是血液汗水还是泪水  投入这里
and tears we had to this place.

950
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,910
但我们没有
But we didn't.

951
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,260
哈维和我一直专注于救出迈克
Harvey and I focused on getting Mike out,

952
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,570
杰西卡和瑞秋专注于伦纳德・贝利
Jessica and Rachel focused on Leonard Bailey,

953
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,530
而你则在一心寻找真爱
and you focused on finding love in your life.

954
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,990
-不是这样的  -就是这样的
- That's not true. - Yes it is.

955
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,980
我还没准备好放弃律所
I'm not ready to give up the firm.

956
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,150
没人说你要放弃律所  路易
No one's saying you have to give up the firm, Louis.

957
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,120
你只需要放我走
You just have to let me go.

958
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,250
你确定吗
You sure about this?

959
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,650
跟你说实话
Tell you the truth,

960
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,570
这是我人生第一次
for first time in my life,

961
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,280
完全充满了未知
I'm not sure about anything,

962
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,850
这一点真的让我怕得要死
and it scares the shit out of me.

963
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,970
但我确定我要这么做
But I'm sure I have to do this.

964
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,970
敬皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特
To Pearson Specter Litt.

965
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,170
敬皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特
To Pearson Specter Litt.

966
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,130
你忙吗
You busy?

967
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,400
当然不忙
Of course not.

968
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,200
我知道你跟我说要花点时间思考
I know you told me to sleep on it.

969
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:13,650
但我不知道那意思是一天还是两天
I didn't know if that meant take a day, two days.

970
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,960
我真的没经历过这种情况
I've never really been in this position before.

971
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,180
-路易  对不起  -我要说的是
- Louis, I'm sorry-- - Here's the thing.

972
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,100
我思考了
I tried to sleep on it,

973
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,260
但我只能想象到没有你  和你
and all I could do was picture a life without you

974
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,370
还未出世的漂亮孩子的生活
and your beautiful unborn baby

975
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,180
只是想想以后我的生活里没有你
and it just made me crazy to think

976
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,100
都快要把我折磨疯了
I wouldn't be part a of it.

977
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,970
塔拉  你要知道我不会今天说好
But Tara, you need to know that I am not gonna say yes

978
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,270
明天就变卦
today and change my mind tomorrow.

979
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,210
我不知道在问你一个问题之前
And I don't know how to give you that reassurance

980
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,400
怎么给你保证
without asking you something first.

981
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,560
天呐  路易
Oh, my God, Louis.

982
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,540
塔拉・梅瑟
Tara Messer.

983
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,340
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

984
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,610
愿意  路易  我愿意
Yes, Louis. I'll marry you.

985
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,470
杰西卡
Jessica.

986
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,110
你怎么来了
What're you doing here?

987
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,810
我想在你去芝加哥之前跟你聊聊
I wanted to talk to you before you left for Chicago.

988
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:33,710
我很高兴  但我不会不说再见就离开的
I'm glad, but I wouldn't have left without saying good-bye.

989
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,240
我不是来说再见的
I didn't just come here to say good-bye.

990
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,160
我来问你  我跟你走怎么样
I came to see what you think about me coming with you.

991
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,310
律所怎么办
What about the firm?

992
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,970
我要离开律所
I'm leaving the firm.

993
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,020
杰西卡  如果你要为了我放弃一切
Jessica, if you're walking away from everything for me--

994
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,060
不  我不单是为你
No, I'm not doing this just for you.

995
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,910
我是为了我自己
I'm doing this for me.

996
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,630
我不想再做企业律师了
I don't want to be a co-operate lawyer any more.

997
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,860
如果你不想让我跟你一起去芝加哥
So, if you don't want me to come to Chicago with you,

998
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,640
我就不去
I won't.

999
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,170
但我要放弃律所了
But I'm walking away

1000
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,260
无论如何
no matter what.

1001
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,560
那就放下跟我走
Then walk away with me.

1002
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,310
你会好起来的对吧
You gonna be okay?

1003
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,600
她是我的导师
She was my mentor.

1004
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,000
但是的  我会好起来
But yeah, I'm gonna be okay.

1005
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,590
你想单独待会儿吗
You want to be alone?

1006
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,750
不想
No.
