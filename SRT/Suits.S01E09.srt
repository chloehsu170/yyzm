迈克  小心
No, Mike, stop.

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,740
-抱歉  -稳住
- Sorry - Smooth.

11
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,780
你有跳芭蕾舞的潜质
You would made a nice ballerina.

12
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,030
我的身体柔韧性确实比较好
I'm not gonna apologize for my lithe physique, okay?

13
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,210
而且  我高中的时候
And, by the way, I was on the wrestling team

14
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,930
是摔跤队的  所以...
in high school, so...

15
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,130
好笑吗
Is something funny?

16
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,420
我只是在想象你跟别人摔跤的情景
I'm just trying to imagine you fighting someone.

17
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,870
我能弄死你
I would kill you.

18
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,450
-你根本碰不到我  -为什么
- You wouldn't touch me. - Why not?

19
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,920
因为你只会盯着我的紧身裤
Because you'd be too busy staring at me in tights.

20
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,900
我哪有
No, I wouldn't.

21
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,290
你刚才就盯着呢
You're doing it right now.

22
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,440
你又没穿紧身裤
You're not wearing any tights.

23
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,240
我还没穿内裤呢
I'm not wearing any underwear.

24
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,490
我...  你...
I'm--you--

25
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,610
好了  威廉姆斯太太
Okay, so, Mrs. Williams,

26
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,780
等肯尼・沃达斯科那边一结束
We're gonna take you to the deposition

27
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,870
我就带您去取证  好吗
as soon as Kenny Verdasco's finished, all right?

28
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,630
你们真是倒霉
You two draw the short straw?

29
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,070
您说什么
I'm sorry?

30
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,120
你们要把癌症病人聚在一起
You're in charge of corralling the cancer patients.

31
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,070
这可不是什么好差事
It's not the most glamorous duty in the world.

32
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,190
我感觉你们俩配合挺默契的
I supposed you two don't mind working together.

33
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,810
你们在一起多久了
How long you been dating?

34
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,250
不  我有女朋友了
No, no, I'm sort of seeing someone--

35
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,610
你们迟早会在一起的
It's gonna happen sooner or later.

36
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,900
-打扰一下  -抱歉  请稍等
- Excuse me. - Excuse me for a moment.

37
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,800
有什么事吗
Yes?

38
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,610
不好意思  我想我走错了
I'm sorry, I think I'm in the wrong place.

39
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,410
你是来为爱默生石油公司的案子作证的吗
Are you here for the Emerson Petroleum deposition?

40
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,360
不  我是哈维・斯佩克特的老朋友
No, no, I'm an old friend of Harvey Specter's.

41
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,560
这地方太大了  搞得我晕头转向
This place is huge. I just get turned around.

42
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,760
能告诉我怎么走吗
Maybe you can point me in the right direction.

43
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,480
没问题
No problem.

44
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,870
看到那边的门了吗
You just see those doors right there?

45
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,330
穿过去乘电梯
Go through to the elevators,

46
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,350
上两层
Then up two floors,

47
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,350
然后向右转
and then you're gonna take a right,

48
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,050
走到大厅  你就会看到唐娜了
and down the hall, and you'll see Donna.

49

把我在军队挣的钱都攒了下来

56
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,060
六年前  我们从纽约的苹果溪
and we moved here from Apple Creek, New York,

57
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,250
搬到这里
six years ago.

我们买了一栋砂石房
We bought a brownstone,

and planted a tomato garden.

和邻居一起吃烧烤
We had barbecues with the neighbors.

61
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,070
梦想已然成真
It was--it was a dream come true.

62
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,270
但被诊断出肺癌之后
After being diagnosed with lung cancer,

63
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,880
我就无法工作了
I couldn't work anymore.

64
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,400
有时候甚至上楼
I mean, there's times I have difficulty

65
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,640
去看看我女儿都很困难
even going up the stairs to my daughter's room.

66
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,790
你在苹果溪高中念过书  是吧
You attended Apple Creek High School, is that right?

67
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,210
四年都在那里念的

68
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,940
你的高中是1985年建的
You high school was built in 1985.

69
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,280
那里以前是做什么的
What was there before?

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,660
一座油井
An oil well,

71
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,150
是爱默生石油公司旗下运营的
Owned and operated by Emerson Petroleum.

72
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,640
肯尼  为什么那所高中被关闭了
Now, Kenny, why was the high school shut down?

73
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,820
因为有200个曾经
Because 200 people who taught at

74
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,750
在苹果溪高中任教或上学的人
or attended Apple Creek High were diagnosed

75

抱歉打断一下
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

77
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,150

是的  有何贵干
Yeah, can I help you?

83
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,620
迈克・罗斯让我来找你
Yeah, Mike Ross told me to find you.

84
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,670
图书室里有个原告晕倒了
We were in the library and one of the plaintiffs fainted,

85
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,880
-他们不知所措了  -天呐

不客气
You're welcome.

88
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,150
你走错了
Wrong office.

89
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,280
哈维  不得不承认  让肯尼・沃达斯科
Harvey, I have to admit, great job making Kenny Verdasco

90
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,080
作为集体诉讼的代表是对的
the face of your class action suit.

91
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,840
我不认识什么肯尼・沃达斯科
I don't know who Kenny Verdasco is.

92
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,210
那你最好弄清楚
Oh, well, you better find out.

93
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,280
你还是先做个自我介绍吧
How about for starters you introduce yourself

94
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,920
不然我就叫保安了  唐娜
or I'm calling security. Donna!

95
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,180
别紧张  我叫特拉维斯・坦纳
Relax, relax. Name's Travis Tanner.

96
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,570
你就是特拉维斯・坦纳
You're Travis Tanner?

97
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,020
你听说过我
You've heard of me.

98
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,410
没有
No.

99
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,050
我是克莱德・麦克菲律所的资深合伙人
I'm a senior partner with Clyde-Macphee.

100
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,190
-我们律所在波士顿  -就算是红袜队
- We're based in Boston. - So are the Red Sox.

101
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,190
波士顿红袜队是美国职棒老牌强队

102
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,520
我也一样不待见
I don't give a shit about them either.

103
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,380
真有趣
That's funny.

104
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,020
可发生在肯尼・沃达斯科身上的事情  
You know what's not funny, is what's happening

105
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,210
就没那么有趣了
to Kenny Verdasco.

106
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,070
现在  他们正在问及他的父母
At this moment, they're asking him about his parents,

107
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,410
他们都是重度烟民  不良嗜好啊
both heavy smokers. Nasty habit.

108
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,480
是的  他们每天抽一包
Yes, a pack a day each.

109
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,090
我18岁之前都和他们住在一起
I lived with them till I was 18.

110
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,000
然后他们会问他在服役期间
And then they'll ask how in the army

111
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,140
怎么会接触镍  铬和碳氢化合物
he was exposed to Nickel, Chromium, and hydrocarbons.

112
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
我是一名步兵
I was an infantry soldier.

113
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,370
这种事情我别无选择
I didn't have much choice in the matter.

114
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,580
更不用说他在十年前
Not to mention the frivolous lawsuit

115
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,270
对施莱沃连锁杂货店的恶意诉讼
he filed ten years ago against the Shriver Grocery Chain.

116
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,370
我不是恶意的
It wasn't frivolous.

117
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,270
我滑倒时把手肘骨摔碎了
I slipped and shattered my elbow.

118
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,390
他们的工作都做得这么到位了
If they're doing such a great job down there,

119
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,140
那你来找我干什么
what are you doing up here in my office?

120
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,560
因为那些材料是我提供的
'cause I gave them all that.

121
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,850
等他们出来的时候
And when they walk out that door,

122
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,750
我就会来个落井下石
I'm gonna be the one who fires their asses.

123
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,450
那你是来给我打气的吗
So you coming to me for a pep talk?

124
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,660
你很有前途啊  老兄
You're gonna do great, kiddo.

125
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,250
不  爱默生石油公司
No, you see, Emerson Petroleum

126
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,770
马上就要输了
was gonna lose this case.

127
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,910
所以他们来找我挽救局面
So they called me in to fix the situation.

128
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,230
当我打败皮尔逊・哈德曼律所时
And when I beat Pearson Hardman,

129
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,660
不希望有人说  
I don't want anyone saying

130
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,470
那是因为他们未派出强将
it was because they didn't send in their best.

131
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,830
抱歉让你失望了
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,

132
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,410
这案子是杰西卡・皮尔逊亲自接手的
but Jessica Pearson's handling this case herself.

133
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,020
如果你觉得她还算不上强将
And if you think that she's not the best,

134
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,730
为什么不去找她较量较量呢
why don't you take a run at her and find out?

135
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,030
好了  我明白你的意思
All right, look, I hear what you're saying,

136
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,140
但事情是这样的
But here's the thing.

137
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,880
我知道你清楚我是谁
I know that you know who I am.

138
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,530
我还知道你在大四的时候
And I also know that during your senior year

139
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,370
因为肩伤而无法参加
you missed out on playing in the state championship

140
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,630
州锦标赛
because of your shoulder.

141
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,530
你因为肩伤而无法投球
You can't pitch with a bad shoulder.

142
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,640
结果后来呢
And what do you know,

143
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,780
没有你  他们还是赢了  哈维
they won without you, Harvey.

144
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,790
现在你扪心自问
Now ask yourself something.

145
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,690
你会让杰西卡・皮尔逊
Are you gonna let Jessica Pearson

146
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,510
替你冲锋陷阵吗
play the big game for you, hmm?

147
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,880
有什么好笑的
What's so funny?

148
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,750
我只是在想象
I'm just thinking about

149
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,940
把你打得落花流水的感觉
how I'm gonna enjoy kicking your ass.

150
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,640
那咱们法庭上见
I'll see you in court.

151
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,600
这对我的过去  我的家人  以及所有
It was an attack on my history, my family,

152
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,850
我在乎的事情都是一种打击
everything I care about.

153
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,070
我事先提醒过你
I told you this was coming.

154
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,590
他们在试图激怒你
They're just trying to rattle you.

155
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,100
是啊  他们干得太棒了
Yeah, well, they're doing a hell of a good job.

156
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,550
肯尼  你是我们的主要原告
Kenny, you're our lead plaintiff.

157
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,210
你得保持冷静
You've got to keep your composure.

158
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,570
我不管什么冷静不冷静的
I don't care about composure.

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,840
我只想达成和解
I want to make a settlement.

160
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,060
那正是他们想要的
That's exactly what they want.

161
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,750
肯尼  这位是哈维・斯佩克特
Kenny, I'd like you to meet Harvey Specter.

162
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,930
是我的得力助手
He's my right hand.

163
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,180
能不能请你的得力助手告诉我
Can your right hand please tell me why

164
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,250
为什么我们不能请求和解
we shouldn't ask for a settlement?

165
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,880
我并不反对适当地和解
I'm not against settling one bit.

166
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,400
但如果我们主动求和  就处于劣势了
But if we go to them, we're weak.

167
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,780
而他们来找我们的话  我们就有优势
They come to us, we're strong.

168
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,650
哈维说得对
Harvey's right.

169
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,490
他们慢你一步  是因为他们小心谨慎
They came after you because they're running scared.

170
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,860
相信我  他们很快就会来找我们的
Trust me, they'll come to us soon enough.

171
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,000
好吧
Okay.

172
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,080
还有件事
One more thing,

173
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,040
余下的取证工作我会延期进行
I'm gonna postpone the rest of the depositions.

174
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,370
别对其他原告说这些事
Don't tell the rest of the plaintiffs what happened.

175
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,500
这是怎么回事啊
What the hell was that?

176
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,080
请让我接手这件案子
I need you to let me take over this case.

177
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,210
是因为那个打断取证的人吧
The guy that came into my deposition.

178
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,050
-他让你出马  -是的
- He called you out? - Yeah.

179
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,390
-他挺厉害的  -是啊
- He's good. - Yeah.

180
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,950
你觉得我应付不了他吗
You think I can't take him?

181
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,630
他提起了州锦标赛的事
He brought up the state championship.

182
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,160
-你的肩膀  -没错
- Oh, shoulder. - Yeah.

183
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,550
搞定他
Take him.

184
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,030
-小心点  -我会的
- Be careful. - I will.

185
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,960
提起州锦标赛的事
Bringing up state championships,

186
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,790
那真是太坏了  
that's just-- that's wrong.

187
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,080
我当时也无能为力
Nothing I wouldn't have done.

188
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,270
谢了
Thanks.

189
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,100
我要你查一下特拉维斯・坦纳的底细
I need you to dig into Travis Tanner.

190
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,210
在哪里就职  就读过哪所学校
Find out where he's worked, where he's gone to school,

191
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,260
打赢过哪些案子
what cases he's won.

192
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,620
这是干嘛  准备为他建个维基百科的词条吗
Why, you thinking about starting a Wikipedia page for him?

193
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,950
这家伙处理案子的方式  我一无所知
I don't know anything about how this guy operates.

194
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,190
在我发起进攻之前  我得彻底了解
And before I make a move, I need to know everything

195
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,690
他是怎么处理案子的
about how this guy operates.

196
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,700
是啊  就为了给他建个维基词条
Right, for his Wikipedia page.

197
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,600
你以为在打热身赛之前  达拉斯小牛队
You think the Mavericks didn't watch game film

198
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,860
不会研究勒布朗的防守进攻方式吗
on LeBron before they played the heat?

199
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,860
勒布朗・詹姆斯: 效力于克里夫兰骑士队

200
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,630
你是哈维・斯佩克特
You're harvey specter.

201
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,830
你不必事先摸清对手底细
You don't need to watch game film.

202
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,040
知道谁会将对手的情况摸得一清二楚吗
Do you know who's watched more game film than anybody?

203
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,270
-不知道  谁  -迈克尔・乔丹
- No. Who? - Michael Jordan.

204
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,130
什么  你怎么知道的
What? How do you know that?

205
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,620
你不信吗  打电话问他
You don't believe me? Let's call him.

206
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,580
-你有迈克尔・乔丹的手机号  -是的
- You have Michael Jordan's phone number. - Yep.

207
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,120
如果我按下了这个按键
If I hit this button right here,

208
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,260
我就打给迈克尔・乔丹了吗
I call Michael Jordan?

209
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,780
电话不就这功能吗
That's kinda how a phone works.

210
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,500
快速拨号按23
Speed dial 23.

211
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,470
-我打了  -打吧
- I'm doing it. - Go for it.

212
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,010
我要问他棒球问题
I'm gonna ask him about baseball.

213
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,820
别问他棒球问题
Do not ask him about baseball.

214
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,310
打...打错了
Wrong--wrong number.

215
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,400
你耍我呢
You're kidding me.

216
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,400
我的天
Oh, my god.

217
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,610
你到底是谁
Who are you?

218
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,660
各位  停下手上的工作
Everybody stop what you're doing,

219
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,020
起立  跟我去图书室
stand up, and follow me in the library.

220
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,760
迈克  你也一样  跟我走
Mike, that goes for you too, up and at 'em.

221
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,640
好的  路易  我很乐意
Yeah, Louis, I'd love to,

222
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,660
但我有些工作要做
but I have some work to do for--

223
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,430
杰西卡陛下不等人
His majesty can't wait.

224
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,880
所有助手现在都跟我去图书室
All associates in the library now.

225
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,750
走吧
Let's go.

226
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,250
走吧
Let's go.

227
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,200
有传言说要提前给我们加薪
Rumor is we're getting our annual raises early.

228
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,550
大家都很兴奋
People are freaking out.

229
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,120
很好  哈罗德
That's great, Harold.

230
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,040
我想去弄个纹身
I'm thinking about getting a tattoo.

231
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,110
不加薪你没钱纹吗
You need a raise for that?

232
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,970
我的房租太高了
I'm really overpaying for my apartment.

233
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,290
大家早上好
Good morning, everyone.

234
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,120
大家也许认为召集你们
Many of you seem to think

235
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,110
是要给你们提前加薪
this is about getting your raises early.

236
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,140
-不是  -郁闷
- It isn't. - Suck.

237
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,270
我们发现公司里有违规现象
We've discovered a breach at the firm.

238
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,530
高度机密的证人名录外泄给了我们的对手
A confidential witness list was leaked to a rival firm,

239
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,800
韦克菲尔德・凯蒂律所
Wakefield-Cady.

240
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,420
也很有可能
Now it's entirely possible

241
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,440
这只是无心之过
that this was an honest mistake.

242
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,510
如果是那样  我们希望当事人
If so, we urge the responsible party

243
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,550
能主动坦白
to come forward.

244
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,630
如果不是  我们很快会彻查清楚
If not, we'll find out soon enough.

245
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,730
不管怎样  
Either way,

246
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,590
我们会把这件事查个水落石出
we will get to the bottom of this.

247
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,100
路易
Louis.

248
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,400
杰西卡觉得这只是犯错
Jessica seems to think a mistake's been made.

249
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,120
我不觉得
I don't believe so.

250
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,390
我也不认为这关乎道德
I also don't believe this is a matter of ethics.

251
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,440
而是忠诚与否
It's a matter of loyalty.

252
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,210
这个房间里的某个人背叛了我们大家
Someone in this room has betrayed us all,

253
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,590
我对此人深痛恶觉
and it makes me sick.

254
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,240
而消息走漏给了韦克菲尔德・凯蒂律所那些小人
The fact that it went to those holier-than-thou pricks

255
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,970
你们知道吗  这使我更加痛恨此人
at Wakefield-Cady, you know what, that makes me sicker.

256
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,030
你们在一起工作
Now, you all work together,

257
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,250
在同一战线  并肩作战
in the trenches, shoulder-to-shoulder,

258
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,120
你们当中肯定有人知道是谁干的
which means one of you must know who did this.

259
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,180
如果你们知道是谁走漏的消息
Now if y'all harbor knowledge of the perpetrator

260
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,450
而不揭发的话
and do not turn him in,

261
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,900
你们就和他一样可恶
You're as bad as the perpetrator himself,

262
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,880
最终你们将一同卷铺盖走人
you along with the perpetrator will be fired.

263
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,830
他在模仿小布什
He's doing George W. Bush.

264
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,350
各位  与我们为敌或为友  就在一念之间
You're either with us or against us, folks.

265
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,530
他说话像小布什  但看起来像切尼
He sounds like bush, but he looks just like Cheney.

266

理查德・布鲁斯・切尼:美国前副总统

267
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,130
你有话要说吗  哈罗德
You got something to tell me, Harold?

268
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,700
没有吗
No?

269
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,190
不想谈一下你在我办公室里
Not that dermatological problem

270
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,800
谈过的皮肤病的问题吗
that you were talking about earlier in my office?

271
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,490
-不想谈那个吗  -不
- No, not that one? - No.

272
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,330
为了表示我的决心
To show you how serious I am,

273
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,430
我有奖励政策
I have an incentive.

274
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,710
揭发背叛者的人
Whoever turns this traitor in

275
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,560
将得到一万美元作为奖励
receives $10,000.

276
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,670
不客气
You're welcome.

277
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,790
回去继续工作吧
Feel free to go back to work.

278
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,450
一万美元  能纹好大一个纹身了吧
$10,000, that's a big tattoo.

279
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,940
是啊  巨大无比
Yeah, it'd be huge.

280
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,990
什么事
Why?

281
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,640
-路易说有个...  -不关我的事
- Louis, there was a-- - I don't care.

282
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,410
关于特拉维斯・坦纳  告诉我你都查到些什么
Tell me what you learned about Travis Tanner.

283
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,700

It's all in there.

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,680
特拉维斯・坦纳曾就读耶鲁大学
Travis Tanner went to Yale,

285
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,770
法学本科  成绩优异

286
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,560
他还是青年网球冠军
He was a junior tennis champion.

287
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,340
网球啊  就和路易一样
Tennis. Just like Louis.

288
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,940
是啊  他在大学也打网球的
Yeah, he played in college too.

289
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,920
-天呐  -更重要的是
- Oh, my god. - More importantly,

290
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,290
他是克莱德・麦克菲律所史上最年轻的资深合伙人
he was the youngest senior partner at Clyde-Macphee.

291
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,500
这家伙的履历无懈可击
This guy's record is off the charts.

292
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,390
是吗
Really?

293
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,020
他擅长代理集体诉讼案

296
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,200
那我怎么从未听说过他
How come I've never heard of him?

297
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,580
很显然  他不愿接受大众关注 
Evidently, he doesn't like to take public credit.

298
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,680
为人低调  也不接受采访
Stays off the radar, he avoids the press.

299
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,230
我也是查看法庭记录才知道这些的
I only found this stuff by looking through court records.

300
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,400
那就说得通了
Now it makes sense.

301
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,750
什么
What?

302
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,200
他觉得我应该认识他
Why he thinks I know him.

303
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,140
他以为其他律师
I know those other attorneys.

304
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,030
会向我提起他
He thinks they've told me about him.

305
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,290
-他们没提起过吗  -没有
- They never did? - No.

306
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,860
-为什么  -因为他们全都败诉于他
- Why not? - Because he beat them.

307
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,590
这家伙挺难对付的嘛
This guy's kind of a badass.

308
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,080
要我帮你要他的签名吗
You want me to get you an autograph?

309
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,590
不用  只是对我们的敌人表示下崇敬
No, I'm just respecting our foe.

310
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,820
-敌人  -《孙子兵法》里说的
- Foe? - It's from The Art of War.

311
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,880
不是吗
No?

312
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,690
不是  听着  我得知道
No, look, I need to know

313
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,340
他打赢的那些案子和我们这起案子的区别
how those other cases are different from ours.

314
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,190
他打赢的那些案子分布在不同地区
Those other cases were spread out

315
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,550
经济基础和社会背景均不相同
geographically, economically, socially.

316
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,070
而我们的案子发生在一个小镇的一所学校里  
Ours is in a single town, a single school

317
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,250
外加一群弱势的原告
with a single cluster of plaintiffs.

318
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,360
很好
That's good.

319
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,860
那个网球混账特拉维斯・坦纳来电
That tennis-playing douchebag Travis Tanner's on the phone.

320
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,700
你知道我一直在听你说话
You know I listen.

321
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,960
特拉维斯  有什么能为你效劳吗
Travis, what can I do for you?

322
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,260
我很乐意谈一下案子的事
Yeah, I'm happy to discuss the case,

323
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,500
不过有个条件
on one condition.

324
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,470
我们得在苹果溪高中碰个头
You're gonna meet me at Apple Creek High School.

325
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,080
一小时候后见
See you in an hour.

326
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,900
为什么要在那见面
Why do you want to meet there?

327
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,340
因为那里是事发地
Because that's ground zero.

328
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,950
我要在谈判时  利用那所学校的遭遇
And I want the emotion of that school under my feet

329
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,010
掌握谈判全局
when I negotiate.

330
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,790
我还以为你反对打情感牌
I thought you were against emotions.

331
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,310
我反对抒发情感
I'm against having emotions,

332
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,690
而不是利用情感
not against using them.

333
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,060
我还以为我们是哥们
Come on, I thought we were homies.

334
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,950
吉米  我没泄露过情报
Jimmy, I didn't leak anything.

335
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,270
我记得你说过
You know, I remember you said

336
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,310
你讨厌路易・利特  而且对于你是否
you hated Louis Litt and you were second-guessing

337
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,560
要继续干律师这一行也犹豫不决
your decision to become a lawyer.

338
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,050
那是在六杯甜酒下肚的情况下私下告诉你的
I told you that in confidence over six cosmopolitans.

339
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,580
那也不代表你不是叛徒啊
It doesn't mean you're not the guy.

340
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,270
哈罗德  不是吧  你喝甜酒吗
Harold, really? You drink cosmopolitans?

341
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,380
别再喝了  除非你和女孩们在一块
Stop doing that unless you're with girls,

342
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,810
而你也没那机会了  还有  吉米
which you never are. And, Jimmy,

343
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,300
你没搞错吧  竟然冲着哈罗德来了
are you kidding me, going after Harold?

344
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,490
你怎么知道不是他干的
What, how do you know he didn't do it?

345
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,730
我们怎么知道不是你干的呢
How do we know you didn't do it?

346
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,680
也许你才是始作俑者吧
Maybe you're the guy.

347
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,970
我的天  各位  这太荒谬了
Oh, my god, guys, this is ridiculous.

348
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,610
你们难道就不认为
All right, has it occurred to any of you

349
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,480
这也许是对我们的考验吗
that maybe this is all just a big test?

350
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,580
有所隐瞒的人才会这么说吧
Spoken like a person with something to hide.

351
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,960
路易强调的是忠诚
Louis was talking about loyalty.

352
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,260
也许只是检验我们忠诚与否的一个测试
Maybe this is just some test to see how loyal we are

353
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,700
我们不必自相残杀  
by not turning on each other.

354
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,180
你开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

355
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,910
杰西卡从来都不会用这招的
Jessica would never play along with something like that.

356
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,190
就算这不是要检验我们
Even if it's not a test,

357
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,130
这是律师办公室  不是自相残杀的世界
this is a law office, not Lord of the Flies.

358
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,540
大家继续工作吧
Everybody get back to work.

359
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,800
这些是加路斯卡一案的摘要吗
Are these the Galusska briefs?

360
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,320
伙计们  路易一直在问我们要这个
You guys, Louis has been hounding us for these.

361
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,740
为什么没人拿去给他
Why hasn't anyone taken them to him?

362
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,640
你们当真吗
Are you serious?

363
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,150
你们怕他
Wow. You're scared of him.

364
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,780
他是路易・利特  他又不是达斯・维德
He's Louis Litt, he's not Darth Vader.

365
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,680
达斯・维德: 《星球大战》中西斯黑暗尊主

366
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,520
这才叫勇气可嘉  吉米  学着点
This is what courage looks like. Jimmy, pay attention.

367
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,680
拜托
Please.

368
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,170
路易  加路斯卡一案的摘要
Louis, the Galusska briefs.

369
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,250
抱歉  送晚了
Sorry they're late.

370
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,700
谢谢了  迈克・罗斯
Hmm, Thank you, Mr. Mike Ross.

371
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,440
-确定你准备好了吗  -我不是已经来了嘛
- Sure you're ready for this? - I'm here, aren't I?

372
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,860
我查过你的底细  你很难捉摸啊
I've been looking into you. You're an elusive man.

373
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,230
你要是行业里的老大
Yeah, well, when you're number one,

374
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,180
就不需要再到处宣传你的战绩了  哈维
you don't need to broadcast your victories, Harvey.

375
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,210
真有意思  在我家乡
That's funny. Where I come from,

376
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,230
老大通常不会去挑战老二
number one doesn't usually challenge number two to a fight.

377
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,080
这个学校是苹果溪的骄傲
This school was Apple Creek's pride.

378
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,460
家长们放心将孩子送到这里
Parents felt safe sending their children here,

379
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,400
老师们安心在这里教书
and teachers felt safe teaching here.

380
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,350
你知道苹果溪高中现在是什么样子吗
You know what Apple Creek High School is now?

381
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,570
小镇郊区的几辆拖车
A bunch of trailers on the outskirts of town.

382
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,560
这都是因为三十年前你的客户
All because 30 years ago your clients

383
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,210
未能封住油井  导致镇民全都得了癌症
failed to cap an oil well and gave them all cancer.

384
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,820
你看到周围的输电线了吗
You see all these power lines around here?

385
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,550
它们在整个小镇纵横交错
They crisscross the entire town.

386
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,710
那条路往前两公里  是油漆厂
Two miles down that road, paint factory.

387
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,200
这里还有微波发射塔
You got a microwave tower.

388
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,740
而眼前这片草地
And all this grass that you see?

389
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,260
近二十年内  每周都会喷洒杀虫剂
It's been treated with pesticide every week for 20 years.

390
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,510
你说是我们的过错  我说你们错了
You say it's our fault. I say you're wrong.

391
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,530
那个办公室的主人  米奇・罗斯沃尔
That office, Mitch Rosewall,

392
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,060
足球教练  得了脑癌
soccer coach, brain cancer.

393
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,440
图书馆的莫尼卡・多德  志愿者
Library, Monica Dodd, volunteer.

394
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,060
她在这里好多年了  得了胃癌
She ran it for years. Stomach cancer.

395
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,650
他们上个月都死了
They both died last month,

396
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,500
而显然他们不是因为杀虫剂而死的
and they sure as hell didn't die from pesticide.

397
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,650
-你有证据吗  -如果上庭
- Can you prove it? - If we go to trial,

398
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,540
就不是提供证据那么简单了
it won't be about proving anything.

399
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,850
那将会牵涉到莫妮卡  米奇和肯尼
It'll be about Monica, Mitch, and Kenny,

400
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,650
到时你绝无胜算
and you won't stand a chance.

401
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,830
太有趣了  哈维
Ah, this is fun, Harvey.

402
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,380
我只能满怀歉意地说  不得不在法庭见了
I'm just sorry to say that we won't get to do this in court.

403
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,610
虽然违背我意  但是爱默生想要和解
Against my advice, Emerson wants to settle.

404
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,430
你耍我吧
You're kidding me.

405
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,650
说了这么多  你却想要和解
After all this, you want to settle.

406
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,280
没耍你  刚刚那些话算是我的说明
No, I don't, but those are my instructions.

407
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,310
到此为止
Call it a draw.

408
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,410
去你的

409
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,970
迈克  到肯尼家去
Mike, get over to Kenny's house.

410
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,160
坦纳想要逼他妥协
Tanner's gonna try and make him cave.

411
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,630
我一收到消息就来了
I came as soon as I got the message.

412
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,830
肯尼
Kenny.

413
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,100
我是哈维・斯佩克特
It's Harvey Specter.

414
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,560
特拉维斯・坦纳在吗  我刚刚还和他在一起
Was Travis Tanner here? I was just with him.

415
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,150
他不会比我先到太久
He couldn't have beaten me by much.

416
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,380
宝贝  你先进屋好吗
Sweetie, why don't you go inside, okay, baby?

417
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,360
来的不是他
No, it wasn't him.

418
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,540
是其他人  他不肯说自己的名字
It was someone else. He wouldn't tell me his name.

419
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,340
他说是皮尔逊・哈德曼律所的  我就让他进屋了
He said he was with Pearson-Hardman, so I let him in.

420
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,760
他提到坦纳的名字了吗
Did he mention Tanner's name?

421
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,860
没有  但是显然他为那人工作
No, but it was obvious that's who he worked for.

422
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,260
他说很快会给我和其他原告
He said me and the other plaintiffs

423
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,510
提供和解条件
were gonna get a settlement offer soon.

424
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,440
-还有吗  -他说如果我们不接受
- What else? - He said if we don't take it,

425
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,790
他们不会放过我们的
that they're gonna go after us.

426
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,300
他们有我们的把柄
That they have dirt on everyone.

427
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,230
他提到伊娃・威廉一家
He mentioned Eva Williams'

428
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,720
因公共场所醉酒闹事而被捕
arrest for public intoxication,

429
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,410
伯尼・拉瑟福德在大学时
Bernie Rutherford's shoplifting arrest

430
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,600
-因入店盗窃而被捕  -那是刑事恐吓
- when he was in college. - That's criminal intimidation.

431
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,360
如果他们想要跟我过不去  没关系
If they want to go after me, that's fine.

432
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,240
我可以应付
I can handle it.

433
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,180
但是其他人  我不知道他们行不行
But the others, I don't know if they can.

434
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,710
你必须要坚强  肯尼
You have to stay strong, Kenny.

435
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
你一旦放弃  一切都会分崩离析
You cave, everything falls apart.

436
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,620
还有一个问题  那家伙长什么样
One more thing, what did this guy look like?

437
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,620
大概是中等身材
I don't know, he was average height,

438
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,940
棕发褐眼
brown hair, brown eyes.

439
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,850
谢了
Thanks.

440
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,620
知道那家伙是谁吗
So figuring out who this guy is?

441
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,910
不知道  我们找不到他的
No. We'll never find him.

442
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,600
你怎么知道坦纳会对肯尼下手
How'd you know  was going after Kenny?

443
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,630
如果我是那种不择手段的人
'Cause if I was the type to go out of bounds,

444
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,000
我一定会那么做
that's exactly what I'd do.

445
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,790
-你不是  -不是
- You're not? - No.

446
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,880
下一步要做什么
So what's our next move?

447
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,250
搬救兵
I'm calling in reinforcements.

448
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:48,970
什么意思
What do you mean?

449
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,070
既然坦纳派人去恐吓肯尼
If Tanner sent a guy to intimidate Kenny,

450
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,440
他肯定还有其它阴谋诡计
he's got something else up his sleeve,

451
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,560
我想知道到底是什么
and I want to know what it is.

452
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,850
怎么了
What?

453
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,110
没什么  你俩就像一个硬币的正反面
Nothing, you guys are like two sides of the same coin.

454
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,610
你说什么  他是另一个我吗
What are you saying, he's another me?

455
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,340
没人能和我媲美
No one is another me.

456
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,430
你告诉唐娜我是另一个你
I mean, you told Donna I was another you.

457
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,860
我从没这么说
I never said that.

458
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,430
你说你在寻找另一个你
You said you were looking for another you,

459
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,840
然后你就聘用了我
and then you hired me.

460
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,590
明白其中的联系了吗
So see how that works?

461
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,070
逻辑
Logic.

462
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,690
迈克跟我走  立刻去我办公室
Mike, let's go. In my office now.

463
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,000
该死  迈克
Oh, damn, Mike.

464
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,330
告诉我你没走漏文件信息  伙计
Tell me you didn't leak the documents, man.

465
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,700
你是我们的本尼迪克特・阿诺德吗
Are you our Benedict Arnold?

466
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,330
本尼迪克特・阿诺德  美国革命家和军事家  与英国人达成秘密协议将纽约州的西点要塞出卖给英方

467
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,500
本尼迪克特・阿诺德  不错的引用
Benedict Arnold, nice reference.

468
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,730
你又在帮你念中学的女友
You helping your high school girlfriend

469
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,630
做家庭作业了吗
with her homework again?

470
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,980
这么说太不厚道了  迈克
Okay, not cool, Mike.

471
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,140
你知道达拉在念社区大学
You know Darla's in community college.

472
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,900
我不知道有什么好笑的  哈罗德
I don't even know why you laughing, Harold.

473
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,000
你都没女人
You don't have a chick.

474
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,940
她成年了
She's of age.

475
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,880
我太为你骄傲了  迈克
I am so very proud of you, Mike.

476
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,740
你现在别抓着我就更好了
Wow, I really wish you weren't touching me right now.

477
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,730
你就是忠心的典范啊
You are what loyalty looks like.

478
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,220
你找出了向韦克菲尔德・凯蒂律所
You rooted out the person responsible

479
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,390
泄露证人名单的叛徒
for leaking the witness list to Wakefield-Cady.

480
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,300
路易  我完全不知你所云
Louis, I have no idea what you're talking about.

481
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,970
你将证据藏在加路斯卡一案的摘要里
It was almost cute how you hid the evidence

482
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,130
真是太可爱了
in the Galusska briefs.

483
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,500
搞得像是你不想要接受表扬
Like you didn't want to take the credit.

484
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,140
什么  路易  我什么也没藏
What? Louis, I didn't hide anything.

485
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,670
别担心  没人会给你贴上告密者的标签
Don't worry, no one's gonna label you a snitch.

486
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,990
告密者
Snitch?

487
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,140
我们根本没想到要检查传真机
We didn't even think to check the fax machines.

488
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,460
太聪明了
That was brilliant.

489
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,030
这份名单正是从本公司发出的
The list was sent from right here in this firm.

490
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,330
这是三天前发出的一份传真提交表格的复印件
This is a copy of a fax submission form sent from three days ago.

491
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,530
这不能用来指证任何人
This doesn't implicate anybody.

492
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,620
那是机要人员密码
That's the confidential employee code.

493
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,860
她一定不知道机器会自动记下
She must not have known that the machine recorded it.

494
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,200
她
She?

495
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,780
等等  为什么我被停职了
Wait, why am I being suspended?

496
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,390
我没有泄露任何文件
I didn't leak any documents.

497
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,070
谁跟路易说是我做的
Who told Louis I did this?

498
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,070
请走吧
Let's go please.

499
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,110
-这边走  -不  不  路易
- This way. - No, no, no, Louis.

500
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,620
你不能这样  我没出卖瑞秋
You have to stop this. I didn't turn Rachel in.

501
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,740
你没想真心告发谁
That's so sweet how you didn't really mean to

502
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,010
真是太体贴了  等下  迈克  站住
hand someone in. Wait, Mike, stop.

503
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,610
你做了件大好事
You did a great thing.

504
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,410
正因为这件好事
And because of that great thing,

505
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,260
一万美金  别一下子花光了
$10,000, and don't spend it in one place.

506
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,790
你说  谢谢你  路易
You say, "Thank you, Louis."

507
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,880
然后  我说  "不客气  迈克"
And then, "You're welcome, Mike."

508
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,500
-瑞秋  -我不想和你说话
- Rachel. - I don't want to talk to you.

509
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,140
-别这样  -既然你不想这样
- Hey, come on. - You want "Come on"?

510
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,120
-为什么要那样对我  -我什么也没做
- Why would you do that to me? - I didn't do anything to you.

511
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,610
我没有传真那份该死的名单
I didn't fax that goddamn list.

512
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,780
我也没出卖你
And I didn't turn you in.

513
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,250
那为什么我被停职了  迈克
Then why was I just suspended, Mike?

514
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,480
我只知道  我给了路易一摞摘要
All I know is that I gave Louis a stack of briefs

515
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,750
里面有印着你机要密码的传真
and there was some fax with your confidential code on it.

516
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,590
如果我要泄露公司文件
Do you think that if I was gonna leak firm documents,

517
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,800
我会笨到在传真上用自己的密码吗
I'd be dumb enough to fax them with my own code?

518
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,640
我知道你不会
No, I don't,

519
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,440
但是不管是谁做的  一定栽赃给了你
but whoever did this must have framed you.

520
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,730
是啊  他成功了
Yeah, well, it worked.

521
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,180
瑞秋  听着  他们会对此展开调查的
Rachel, look, you just-- they're gonna investigate this.

522
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,850
他们会还你清白的  你知道的
They're gonna clear your name, you know that.

523
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,170
我在那里工作了五年
I've worked there for five years,

524
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,670
他们就这么对待我
and this is how they treat me?

525
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,480
我被停职了  迈克
I'm suspended, Mike.

526
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,220
很有可能还会被解雇
I'm probably gonna be fired.

527
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,210
我该告他们的
I should sue them.

528
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,000
别那么冲动好吗
Okay, let's not do anything rash, okay?

529
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,020
这不是冲动  我只是要为自己讨个公道
It's not rash. It's standing up for myself.

530
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,880
瑞秋  你
Rachel, you--

531
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,730
你反应过度了
You're over-react--

532
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,380
打扰一下
Excuse me.

533
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,210
你该不会恰好知道什么葡萄酒
You wouldn't happen to know what sort of wine

534
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,130
配鲜橙h鸭最好吧
pairs well with a duck l'orange, would you?

535
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,940
试试全果味的吧
Try something with a full fruit flavor,

536
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,600
比如赤霞珠
like a cabernet sauvignon.

537
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,690
赤霞珠对我来说有点清淡
Eh, sauvignons are a little bit oaky for my palate.

538
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,660
这儿正好有篇文章
This article right here

539
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,010
是关于黑比诺葡萄酒重获青睐的
is all about the resurgence of pinot noir.

540
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,310
你知道  你完全能在大庭广众下付我钱
You know, you could just pay me right out in public.

541
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,100
可是那样我就不像007了
But then I wouldn't feel like James Bond.

542
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,340
这么说的话  我又像谁呢
Oh, who's that make me?

543
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,990
普茜・葛罗尔[007之金手指中的邦女郎]
Pussy Galore.

544
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,570
奥科托普茜[007之八爪女的邦女郎]
Octopussy?

545
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,800
行了  哈维
That's enough, Harvey.

546
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,270
你给我带了什么来
What do you have for me?

547
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,840
没什么  表面上看坦纳没什么问题
Nothing. On paper, Tanner's clean.

548
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,230
他也许不按规矩办事  但没留下证据
He may break the rules, but he covers his tracks.

549
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,920
你可从没两手空空地来找过我
You've never come up empty for me before.

550
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,310
这次也不例外
I didn't this time either.

551
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,250
坦纳在沃尔多夫酒店订了间会议室
Tanner booked a conference room

552
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,750
明天中午用
at the Waldorf tomorrow at noon.

553
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,890
分而治之  各个击破
Divide and conquer.

554
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,140
他要叫来所有原告
He's gonna gather my plaintiffs,

555
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,140
吓唬他们  然后给他们一个极低的报价
scare them, and then give them a lowball offer.

556
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,490
但这么做是违法的
And that's illegal.

557
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,130
怎么了
What?

558
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,910
你让我为你做过许多事
You've used me for a lot of things.

559
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,530
但你从没让我
You've never asked me to investigate

560
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,730
去调查另一个律师
another attorney before.

561
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,310
这家伙有点本事
This guy's good.

562
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,540
如果他给你的原告打电话
If he called your plaintiffs,

563
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,990
我能搞到他的通话记录来证明这一点
I can get his phone records to prove it.

564
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,870
他不会亲自给他们打电话的
He didn't make those calls himself.

565
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,220
他明天也不会去沃尔多夫酒店 
He's not gonna be at the Waldorf either tomorrow.

566
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,430
不过我会去
But I will.

567
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,280
唐娜  你能不能告诉我
Donna, can you tell me

568
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,240
路易说的瑞秋用来
about these confidential employee codes

569
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,080
把证人名单传真到韦克菲尔德・凯蒂律所的
that Louis says Rachel used to fax the witness list

570
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,340
员工个人代码是怎么回事
over to Wakefield-Cady?

571
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,450
我在午饭前有很多事要做
I have a thousand things to do before lunch.

572
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,180
拉着年幼迈克的手过马路
Hold Mike's hand while he crosses the street,

573
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,370
可不在其中
not one of them.

574
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,550
唐娜  这次是为了瑞秋
Donna, this one's for Rachel.

575
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,730
你需要什么
What do you need?

576
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,710
我知道我们用账单代码来向客户收费
I know we use the billing codes to charge the clients,

577
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,320
但员工个人代码是干嘛用的
but what do we use the employee codes for?

578
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,710
那是一些特殊的代码
They're special codes for when you need to use

579
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,630
让你可以用公司的资源来办私事
the firm's resources for personal reasons.

580
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,570
我们还能这么做
We can do that?

581
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,820
-你不行  但是瑞秋可以  -为什么
- You can't, but Rachel can. - Why?

582
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,250
因为对公司来说  一个入职五年的
Because a fifth-year paralegal

583
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,690
律师助理比一个刚入行的助理律师更重要
is more valuable to the firm than a first-year associate.

584
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,540
好吧  那你有个人代码吗
Okay, so do you have a personal code?

585
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,530
-我有两个  -你是从哪儿弄到的
- I have two. - So where do you get them?

586
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,910
是由I.T.部门发给我们的
They're generated by the I.T. Department.

587
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,250
我们还有I.T.部门
We have an I.T. Department?

588
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,170
这些电脑又不会自己运行
The computers don't run themselves.

589
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,430
至少在天网变活跃之前不会
At least until skynet goes active.

590
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,520
莎拉・康纳说的[终结者2中男主的母亲]
Sarah Connor.

591
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,070
太烂了
No.

592
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,250
-糗了  我得再练练  -太烂了
- No, I'll work on that. - Really bad.

593
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,590
什么
What?

594
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,540
你好  打扰一下  我想找本杰明
Uh, hi, excuse me. I'm looking for Benjamin.

595
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:36,820
哥就是
You found him.

596
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,450
那太好了  我是迈克・罗斯
Oh, great, I'm Mike Ross.

597
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,960
我们刚刚通过电话
We just spoke on the phone.

598
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,450
老天  这地方就像《银河战星》里的航母
Man, this place is like Battlestar Galactica.

599
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,450
《银河战星》  美国科幻电视连续剧

600
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,910
你们把机器人放在哪儿
Where do you guys keep the cylons?

601
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,770
皮尔逊・哈德曼律所照顾我们的生意
Pearson-Hardman takes care of us

602
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,380
因为我们二十四小时随传随到
because we're on call 24/7.

603
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,480
如果服务器出现故障
If a server goes down

604
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,420
或是哪个合伙人的电脑出了问题
or a partner's computer crashes,

605
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,890
这是生死攸关的事情
people die.

606
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,740
这有点夸张了  你不觉得吗  本
That's a little dramatic, don't you think, Ben?

607
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,900
叫我本杰明
It's Benjamin.

608
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,810
我敢说你肯定不喜欢别人叫你迈克
I'm sure you don't like it when people call you Mike.

609
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,300
事实上  我更喜欢别人叫我迈克
Actually, I prefer Mike.

610
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,200
好吧  迈克  六个月前我在
Well, Mike, six months ago

611
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,740
康纳利・怀特律所  他们的网络故障
I was at Connolly White, the network went haywire,

612
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,430
我们当时正在做一个价值四亿美元的
and we were in a breach of contract litigation

613
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,480
违约诉讼
worth $400 million.

614
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,970
需要在一小时内排除故障
They needed it fixed in an hour.

615
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,450
大家都认为这是不可能的
No one thought it could be done.

616
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,920
但是我只用了二十三分钟就使之起死回生
I had the network up and running again in 23 minutes.

617
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,600
你觉得这够夸张不
Is that dramatic enough for you?

618
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,540
哇  你就像是现实中的扎克伯格
Wow, you're like a regular Zuckerberg.

619
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,690
扎克伯格[美国Facebook创始人]
Z-zuckerberg?

620
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,570
扎克伯格那技术给我打下手都不够
Zuckerberg couldn't code his way out of a paper bag.

621
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,580
你打电话是为了员工个人代码的事
You called about the employee codes.

622
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,060
你今年刚来  没有代码  不好意思
You're a first year. You can't have one, sorry.

623
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,280
好吧  其实  我也不需要
Okay, well, I don't need one.

624
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,650
我只想知道有没有可能
I just want to know if it's possible

625
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,830
有人能拿到别人的代码
for someone to gain access to somebody else's code.

626
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,570
当然  只有一个人可以  就是我
Sure. For one person, me.

627
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,660
我可以拿到所有人的代码
I have access to all of the codes.

628
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,530
好吧  那在你为这里工作的短暂时间里
Okay, so in your short tenure here,

629
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,320
有没有人曾从你这里
has anyone ever asked you for access

630
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,810
拿到过别人的代码
to someone else's code?

631
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,320
有过一回  就在上个礼拜
Once. Last week.

632
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,330
-谁  -我不能告诉你
- Who? - I can't tell you that.

633
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,120
为什么不能
Why not?

634
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,910
I.T.员工与客户保密协议
I.T. Officer/Client Privilege.

635
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,040
有这玩意儿吗  本
Does that even exist, Ben?

636
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,660
我心里有
It does in here.

637
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:06,680
好吧  本  我们来打个赌
All right, Ben, why don't we make a bet?

638
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,860
我想你是说要下个注  迈克
I think you mean a wager, Michael.

639
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,570
对  没错
Yeah, sure.

640
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,210
如果我能说对这张纸上的所有数字
I'm gonna tell you every single number on this piece of paper,

641
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,030
你就告诉我那个人是谁
and you're gonna give me that name.

642
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,700
如果你说错了呢
And if you can't?

643
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,230
那我就给你这张一万美元的支票
Then I'm gonna give you this check for 10 grand.

644
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,390
你说错一个数字  一个逗号或是小数点
You get one number, one comma, one decimal point wrong,

645
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,650
那钱就归我了
and that money is mine.

646
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,850
对了  要是我赢了
Oh, and when I win,

647
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,500
我还要一台那样的电脑
I'll also take one of those computers.

648
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,590
还有  告诉你
And for the record,

649
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,360
那上面一个逗号也没有
there's not a single comma on there.

650
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:38,900
你准备好了没
You ready?

651
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,950
瑞秋  我是迈克
Rachel, it's Mike.

652
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,460
我查出是谁把名单泄露给韦克菲尔德・凯蒂律所了
I figured out who leaked the list to Wakefield-Cady.

653
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,280
是路易干的  给我回电话
It was Louis. Call me back.

654
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,900
你好  我是瑞秋・赞恩  我来面试
Hi, I'm Rachel Zane. I'm here for my job interview.

655
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,900
-欢迎来到韦克菲尔德・凯蒂律所  -谢谢
- Welcome to Wakefield-Cady. - Thank you.

656
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,180
好  我们进去后
Okay, as soon as we get inside

657
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,620
我要你找到跟你谈过话的所有原告
I need you to find every plaintiff you interviewed

658
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,740
告诉他们那人把找他们来是一种欺诈行为
and tell them they're here under false pretenses.

659
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,430
-没问题  -肯尼会在这儿跟我们碰头
- Done. - Kenny's meeting us here.

660
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,870
我们需要他来辨认那个去找他的人
We need him to identify the man who came to see him,

661
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,870
然后就等着他接近
and we're gonna wait for that guy to approach

662
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,830
我们的任一个原告
any of our plaintiffs.

663
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,330
如果我们能证明那个人和坦纳有联系
And if we connect that guy to Tanner,

664
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,190
我们就可以告他刑事恐吓
then we have him on criminal intimidation.

665
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,430
这样一来  爱默生石油公司只能选择和解
And Emerson Petroleum will have no choice but to settle.

666
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,160
你好  肯尼  见到你很高兴
Hey, Kenny. Good to see you.

667
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,150
今天有好戏看了
This is gonna be fun.

668
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,300
你说的没错
You were right.

669
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,130
他把所有人都叫来了
He called every one of them.

670
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,330
看见去找你的那人了吗
You see the guy?

671
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,530
没有
No.

672
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,940
好好找找
Start looking.

673
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,730
等一下
Hey, wait a minute.

674
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,600
威廉姆斯夫人  还记得我吗
Mrs. Williams, do you remember me?

675
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,110
我是迈克・罗斯  律所的员工
I'm Mike Ross, from the office.

676
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,060
我记得你
I remember you.

677
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,280
我能问问您您今天怎么会来这儿吗
Do you mind if I ask you what you're doing here today?

678
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,290
我们被请来听取和解的报价
We were invited to come and hear a settlement offer.

679
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,720
这样啊
Really?

680
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,040
不好意思  我得走开一会儿
Um, excuse me just for a minute.

681
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,350
他亲自来了
He came here himself.

682
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,890
他犯了个大错
Big mistake.

683
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,940
虽然我不想搞砸你的午餐
Sorry to ruin your little brunch,

684
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,210
但我想你很清楚
but I think you know damn well

685
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,530
你私下联络我的委托人是违法的
that you can't legally address my clients.

686
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,510
我来这儿只是为了喝点果汁
Hey, I just came for the juice.

687
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,160
纯果汁哦
Pulp free.

688
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,040
我知道我不能直接跟你的委托人谈话
I know I can't talk to your clients directly.

689
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,130
不过谢天谢地你也在这儿  哈维
But thank God you're here, Harv.

690
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,680
因为我可以跟你谈话
Because what I can do is I can talk to you.

691
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,650
哈维  爱默生石油公司
Harvey, Emerson Petroleum

692
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,800
会赔偿你的每一位委托人两万五千美元
is offering $25,000 to each and every one of your clients.

693
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,000
如果他们不接受的话
They don't take that,

694
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,120
这场官司会持续好几年
this trial stretches out for years.

695
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,430
盘问会毫不留情
Cross-examinations will be brutal.

696
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,020
但是如果你们肯接受
You take our settlement,

697
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,710
整个事情明天就雨过天晴了
and this whole thing will be gone tomorrow.

698
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,120
如果你的任何一位委托人
Now if any of your clients

699
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,720
想联系我的话
want to get in touch with me,

700
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,820
这是我的电话号码
here's my number.

701
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,800
罗斯先生
Mr. Ross.

702
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,160
哈维
Harvey.

703
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,900
把那号码擦了
Erase that number.

704
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,030
出来混总是要还的  这你还是知道的吧
You're not gonna get away with what you're doing.

705
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,100
这你心里清楚吧
You know that, right?

706
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,460
怎么了
What?

707
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,450
我不过是高声跟你说话而已
I just addressed you with a raised voice.

708
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,240
我耳朵有时不太灵光
Sometimes my ears aren't so good.

709
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,600
要是别人听到我的话  那抱歉了  哈维
If other people heard me, I apologize, Harvey.

710
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,890
我很高兴你的足智多谋
I'm just glad you were smart enough

711
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,560
帮你查到我预订了沃尔多夫酒店
to figure out I booked the Waldorf.

712
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,910
我得接这个电话
Mmm, I think I need to take this.

713
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,080
我想是你哪位客户
I'm guessing it's one of your clients

714
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,980
打算接受我的和解条款了
wanting to take my settlement offer.

715
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,470
你好
Hello.

716
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,790
坦纳  我要追你到天涯海角
Tanner. I'm coming after you.

717
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,640
没错  我有你电话
Oh, I got your number.

718
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,380
原告都害怕了
Plaintiffs are scared.

719
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,490
他们都考虑要接受坦纳的低额条款
They're talking about accepting Tanner's lowball offer.

720
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,860
这道闸门一开  我们将溃不成军
Those floodgates open and we're done.

721
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,580
所以我去找了克拉克森
That's why I went to go see Clarkson.

722
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,820
法律财务部的那个吗
The legal finance guys?

723
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,330
如果我们能帮原告贷到款
If we can get our plaintiffs a loan

724
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,720
资助他们将来的诉讼费用
against a future jury award,

725
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,830
闸门就会关上  也为我们赢得时间
it'll close the floodgates and buy us more time.

726
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,660
这种贷款可不是小数目  哈维
Those loans aren't cheap, Harvey.

727
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,280
总比他们为了点小钱就答应和解强
Well, it's better than settling for pennies on the dollar.

728
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,450
-那去办吧  -我试过了
- Then do it. - I tried,

729
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,340
但没有担保金他们一毛不拔
but they won't give us anything without collateral.

730
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,820
他们觉得你赢不了
They don't think you can win.

731
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,080
庸人之见
They're wrong.

732
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,930
这话我爱听
That's what I like to hear.

733
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,000
我需要一百万才能拿到贷款
I need a million dollars to get that loan.

734
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,930
你是想公司掏钱吗
Are you talking about firm money?

735
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,180
-正是  -门都没有
- Yeah. - No way that happens.

736
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,260
你也不敢在我身上下注吗
You don't think I'm a good bet?

737
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,680
跟那个无关
That has nothing to do with it.

738
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,750
这原来还是你的案子呢
This was your case.

739
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,280
可我交给你来做制胜一击
And I gave it to you to win.

740
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,630
这我能够胜任  只要你给我点信心
Which I will do if you just show some faith in me.

741
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,200
信心可以给你
You can have my faith,

742
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,730
但钱不能
But you're not getting my money.

743
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,160
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

744
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,860
我给你留了三条信息了
I left you three messages.

745
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,970
是路易陷害你  我们可以拿下他
Louis framed you. We can take him down.

746
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,400
我不想拿下他  迈克
I don't want to take him down, Mike.

747
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,270
为什么
Why not?

748
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,680
因为我想重新开始
Because I want a fresh start.

749
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,230
那你不想在皮尔逊・哈德曼律所工作了吗
So you don't wanna work at Pearson-Hardman anymore?

750
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,230
我已经在韦克菲尔德・凯蒂律所面试了
I applied for a job at Wakefield-Cady.

751
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,580
他们当场就录用我了
They offered it to me in the room.

752
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,790
我周一上班
I start Monday.

753
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,390
你跑去那里工作
You took a job at the company

754
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,040
他们手里有泄露名单啊
that ended up with the leaked list?

755
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,000
你知道这看上去像什么吗
Do you know what that looks like?

756
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,150
我才不在乎呢
I don't care what it looks like.

757
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,700
我没做错什么  我还需要工作
I'm not guilty, and I need a job.

758
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,120
这么说你凡事都要知难而退
So the going gets rough, and you just quit?

759
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,770
我不是主动离开的  我是被解雇了
No, I'm not quitting. I was fired, remember?

760
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,930
不  你被停职了
No, you were suspended,

761
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,220
你还能保住你的工作
And you could still save your job.

762
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,870
路易想撵我走  我也不强留
If Louis wants me gone, I'm gone.

763
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,460
瑞秋  路易还陷害过我
Rachel, Louis tried to frame me once,

764
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,370
而我还击了
And I fought back.

765
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,620
你为什么不能这样呢
Why aren't you doing the same thing?

766
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,030
因为除了你
Because except for you,

767
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,730
皮尔逊・哈德曼律所再没第二个人关心我
no one from Pearson-Hardman has contacted me at all.

768
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,620
我为什么还要拼命留在那儿
Why would I fight to stay there?

769
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,210
他们说我泄露机密
They're accusing me of spilling secrets?

770
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,460
我就泄露一个给他们瞧瞧
I'll show 'em spilling secrets.

771
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,640
我会把一切都告诉韦克菲尔德・凯蒂律所
I'll tell Wakefield-Cady everything.

772
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,600
我做不到过目不忘  迈克
I may not have a photographic memory, Mike,

773
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,360
但我也知道不少
but I sure as hell know a lot.

774
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,310
瑞秋
Rachel.

775
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,410
钱班尔[007电影里M夫人的秘书]
Moneypenny.

776
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,210
-别那么喊我  -为什么
- Don't call me that. - Why not?

777
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,140
因为她喜欢他[邦德]
Because she had a thing for him.

778
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,210
我们正好相反
This is the other way around.

779
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,490
你不喜欢我吗
You don't like me?

780
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,780
不喜欢你还会给你这个吗
Like you enough to give you this.

781
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,160
这是什么
What's that?

782
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,090
我窃听了爱默生石油公司的电话
I tapped the phones at Emerson Petroleum.

783
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,540
这是特拉维斯・坦纳和几位
This is a conference call between Travis Tanner

784
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,910
爱默生高管之间的电话会议
and several high-ranking Emerson executives.

785
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,460
希望他们除了天气还聊别的了
I hope they're talking about more than just the weather.

786
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,370
他们还谈坦纳胁迫你客户的事了
They're talking about Tanner intimidating your client.

787
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,050
你我都心知肚明  没有搜查令
Both you and I know that without a warrant

788
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,780
这通录音是不被法庭接受的
this recording's not admissible in court.

789
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,210
如果你作证说录音来源不明就可以了
It is if you testify that you don't know where it came from.

790
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,560
你为什么这么帮我
Why'd you do this?

791
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,730
因为你需要
Because you need it.

792
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,100
我不会为了赢得案子而作伪证的
I'm not gonna commit perjury to win a case.

793
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,370
好奇怪啊  看我找到了什么
Oh, weird, look what I found.

794
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,280
你真是一群黑脸胖子里的白马王子
You are a prince among men.

795
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,420
我真不懂你为什么加脱脂牛奶
I don't understand why you use skim milk

796
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,430
再放鲜奶油和糖
and then put whipped cream and sugar in it.

797
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,530
因为我加的是脱脂牛奶
Because I use skim milk,

798
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,690
所以我能放鲜奶油和糖
I can put whipped cream and sugar in it.

799
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,230
怎么了
What's wrong?

800
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,950
-我们能谈谈吗  -行啊
- Can we talk for a second? - Yeah.

801
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,810
上周路易从信息技术部
Last week Louis got Rachel's confidential code

802
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,150
拿到了瑞秋的内部密码
from the I.T. Department.

803
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,790
然后呢
And?

804
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,770
然后这就是铁证啊
And it's a smoking gun.

805
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,720
是他陷害了她
He's the one that set her up.

806
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,550
路易为什么要背叛公司啊
Why would Louis betray the firm?

807
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,650
我哪知道  或许他对没当上资深合伙人
I don't know, maybe he's still upset

808
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,100
一事还耿耿于怀
that he got passed over for senior partner

809
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,060
于是弃船告别前就泄露了名单
and leaked the list before he jumped ship.

810
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,800
迈克  路易万般不是  也不是叛徒
Mike, Louis is a lot of things, but he's not a traitor.

811
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,320
他流的是皮尔逊・哈德曼律所的血
That man bleeds Pearson-Hardman.

812
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:36,950
他这会儿大概
He's probably wearing

813
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,260
就穿着皮尔逊・哈德曼律所 的内裤呢
Pearson-Hardman underwear right now.

814
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,170
我跟他去过网球俱乐部
I went to the tennis club with him.

815
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,050
听我的  他不穿内裤的
Trust me, he doesn't wear underwear.

816
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,660
我也在乎瑞秋
I care about Rachel too.

817
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,960
但这不是路易干的
Louis didn't do this.

818
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,830
好吧
Okay.

819
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,200
还有  如果你再向我提及
And if you ever mention

820
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,540
路易穿什么内衣
Louis' underwear situation to me again--

821
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,380
是你提起来的
You're the one that brought it up.

822
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,030
-消失  -遵命
- Go. - Okay.

823
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,260
共有74名原告
74 plaintiffs.

824
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,030
真不敢相信他们会为了两万五屈服
I can't believe they're willing to cave for $25,000.

825
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:05,760
别着急
Slow down.

826
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,670
我们得想办法击败坦纳
We need to figure out how to beat Tanner.

827
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,670
我一直被这家伙牵着鼻子走
Guy's been a step ahead of me this entire time.

828
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,060
-原因很明显嘛  -什么原因
- It's pretty obvious why. - Why?

829
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,100
你跟我说你知道他会去找肯尼
You told me that you knew he'd go to Kenny

830
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,480
是因为换了你也会这么做
because that's what you'd do,

831
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,290
前提是你愿意做出格的事的话
if you were willing to go out of bounds.

832
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,280
你是通过想你自己的招数来预测他的脚步
You anticipated him by thinking about what you'd do.

833
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,200
继续说
And?

834
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,040
而他也是这么预测你的
And that's exactly what he's doing to you.

835
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,610
或许你想走在这家伙前面
Maybe the only way to get ahead of this guy

836
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,430
就得想想你不会做什么
is to, I don't know, think about what you wouldn't do.

837
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,560
出其不意  这点子好
Surprise myself. I like that.

838
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,110
不客气
You're welcome.

839
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,900
你想告诉我你有什么打算吗
You wanna tell me what you're doing?

840
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,270
不要
Nope.

841
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,720
这对想出这个点子的人不太公平啊
Doesn't seem fair to the person whose idea it was.

842
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,700
我对空气弹琴呢
You're gone.

843
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,510
-你想跟我谈  说吧  -我是想谈
- You wanted to talk, talk. - I did.

844
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,050
我想把我们之间的争斗放下
I want to put this competition aside,

845
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,630
就算我们平手
call it a draw.

846
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,490
打退堂鼓了  哈维
Tapping out, Harv?

847
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,940
那个不是重点
This isn't about that.

848
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,630
这些活生生的人才是重点
This is about real people.

849
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,400
你给他们个合理的出价
You make them a reasonable offer,

850
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,330
我会让他们接受的
I'll get them to take it.

851
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,580
活生生的人
Real people?

852
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,710
你穿着一万二的西装站在那儿
You're standing there in a $12,000 suit

853
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,610
指使我消极怠工
asking me not to do my job.

854
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,790
你那么关心活生生的人
You care so much about those real people,

855
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,870
那就把你的午饭钱给他们吧
I suggest you give them your lunch money

856
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,310
但别来要我的
but don't ask me for mine.

857
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,410
凡妮莎  我到底还是需要那盘窃听带
Vanessa, I'm gonna need that wiretap after all.

858
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,630
-还有咖啡吗  -最后一杯
- Is there any more of that? - Last cup.

859
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,370
-那你煮...  -没
- Did you make-- - Nope.

860
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,850
老兄  这是基本礼貌
Dude, that's common courtesy.

861
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,370
你喝完一壶  就再煮一点
You finish a pot, you make another one.

862
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,540
我不做你要去找路易打小报告吗
You gonna turn me into Louis if I don't?

863
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,480
让我也被炒了
Hmm? Get me fired too?

864
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,690
迈克
Michael.

865
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,550
本杰明  你有东西给我吗
Benjamin, you got something for me?

866
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,970
愿赌服输  公平合理
Wager's a wager, fair is fair.

867
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,570
这是你的GX-9000
Here's your GX-9000.

868
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,630
你是个好人
You're a good man.

869
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,240
你用它看毛片  我会知道的
Use it for porn, and I'll know.

870
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,940
好奇怪
Weird.

871
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,500
路易  你好啊
Hey, Louis, how you doing?

872
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,480
本杰明刚刚为什么叫你路易
Why did Benjamin just call you Louis?

873
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,250
不知道  叫错了吧
I don't know. Made a mistake.

874
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,930
他没叫错
No, he didn't.

875
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,900
他叫你路易因为他认为你就是路易
He called you Louis because he thinks you are Louis.

876
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,160
是你谎称自己是路易
Because you posed as Louis

877
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,240
骗取瑞秋的员工代码
to get Rachel's employee code,

878
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,210
不是吗
didn't you?

879
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,150
听着  迈克  事实不是你想的那样
Look, Mike, it's not what you think.

880
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,800
事实就是如此
It's exactly what I think.

881
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,670
如实交待吧  吉米
Go on. Start talking, Jimmy,

882
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,500
不然我叫上本杰明
or I'll get get Benjamin

883
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,140
我们一起去见杰西卡
and we can all go see Jessica together.

884
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,930
听着
Listen,

885
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,700
韦克菲尔德・凯蒂答应让我做初级合伙人
Wakefield Cady offered me a junior partnership

886
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,090
只要我泄露证人名单
if I leaked the witness list.

887
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,980
迈克  听我说
No, no, listen, Mike.

888
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,750
因为上法学院我背了一身债
I have huge law school debts.

889
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,140
这点你肯定能明白
Okay? I mean, don't you?

890
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,500
我没法坐等皮尔逊・哈德曼
I can't wait for Pearson Hardman

891
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,740
升我做合伙人
to make me a partner.

892
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,240
那你还待在这儿做什么
So what are you still doing here then?

893
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,630
我把名单交给他们后
After I gave them the list,

894
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,830
他们反悔了
they reneged on the offer.

895
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,500
世事难料
Big surprise.

896
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,800
还真没想到他们会用这招
I didn't see that one coming.

897
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,340
别告发我  迈克  求你了
Just don't turn me in, Mike, please.

898
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,960
我家境贫寒
I came from nothing.

899
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,600
拼死拼活才上了哈佛法学院
I worked my ass off to get into Harvard Law

900
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,290
好不容易成为这儿的律师
and become an associate here.

901
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,840
你知道谁也一样拼死拼活吗
You know who else worked their ass off?

902
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,110
瑞秋・赞恩  因为你的所作所为
Rachel Zane, the paralegal who got fired

903
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,070
而被解雇的律师助理
because of what you did.

904
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,030
我并不知道用的她的代码
I didn't know it was her code.

905
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,970
只是需要使用些号码  兄弟
I just needed some numbers, man.

906
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,390
我没想到会被发现
I didn't think I was gonna get caught.

907
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,570
迈克  我犯了个错误
Look, Mike, I made one mistake.

908
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,850
好吗
Okay?

909
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,700
难道你不曾铤而走险
I mean, haven't you ever cut some corners,

910
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,240
做出后悔的事吗
done some things you regretted?

911
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,200
吉米  我并不是针对你  好吗
Jimmy, I like you, man, okay?

912
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,860
但要还瑞秋清白
But to clear Rachel's name,

913
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,450
必须让他们知道内奸另有其人
they have to know she wasn't the one.

914
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,980
如果你主动承认
If you come forward,

915
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,510
他们顶多解雇你
maybe they fire you.

916
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,240
可如果你是被我告发的
If I turn you in,

917
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,060
这就永远是你职业生涯中的污点
it's gonna follow you for the rest of your career.

918
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,720
你自己决定
It's up to you.

919
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,220
哈维  我想帮你一个忙
Harvey, I'm gonna do you a favor.

920
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,190
为何不让迈克・罗斯出去散个步
Why don't you tell Mike Ross to take a hike?

921
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,230
他可以待着
He can stay.

922
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,420
好的
Okay.

923
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,820
你的原告中有九十五人
You see, 95 of your plaintiffs

924
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,620
已经打过电话咨询和解的情况
have already called me about the settlement.

925
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:27,850
其他人明白利害关系
It's just a matter of time

926
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,560
也只是早晚而已
before the rest of them see the light.

927
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,770
我赢了
I win.

928
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,100
我不知道你这信息是什么时候的
I don't know the last time you checked,

929
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,770
但据我所知  今天早上
but as of this morning

930
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,260
我的两百名原告依然坚持诉讼到底
all 200 of my plaintiffs are staying with me.

931
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,340
胡扯
Bullshit.

932
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,190
我给他们预支了一笔胜过和解的金额
I got them an advance against their settlement.

933
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,680
没有哪家正常的金融机构
No finance company in their right mind

934
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,100
会给你的诉讼做担保
will back your suit.

935
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,920
我不知道耶鲁是否有教你数学
I don't know if they taught you math at Yale,

936
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,340
但这可是五百万
but that's 5 million.

937
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,880
每名原告两万五美金
$25,000 a plaintiff.

938
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,530
正是你们收买他们的金额
Exactly what you tried to buy them off for.

939
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,170
你知道这意味着什么吗
You know what this means?

940
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,830
我会逐一对付他们
I'm gonna hammer them all one by one,

941
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,750
个个击破  索性大家都撕破脸
break them down, and it's gonna get ugly.

942
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,350
不  你不会
No, you're not.

943
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,860
这是什么
What the hell is that?

944
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,160
你和爱默生石油公司讨论如何派人
It's a conversation between you and Emerson Petroleum

945
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,570
恐吓肯尼・沃达斯科的谈话
discussing how you sent a man to intimidate Kenny Verdasco.

946
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,780
听听吧
Take a listen.

947
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,210
放心  不会让你患上癌症
Don't worry, it's not gonna give you cancer.

948
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,760
不管这是什么  
No matter what that is,

949
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,890
都是法庭不允许采纳的物证
it's not admissible.

950
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,980
除非当然  你有搜查令  而你没有
Unless of course you had a warrant, which you didn't.

951
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,190
家门前捡到的
Showed up on my doorstep.

952
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,460
我写了宣誓书以证明它的真实性
And I declared that in this affidavit

953
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,060
并将呈送法庭
which I'm about to send to court.

954
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,930
你作伪证
So you're gonna perjure yourself

955
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,280
就是为了赢这案子吗
just to win this case?

956
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,790
不  我不会作伪证
No, I'm not gonna perjure myself.

957
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,590
即使我要作
Even if I were,

958
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,280
也不会就为了赢这件案子
it wouldn't be just to win this case.

959
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,080
而是要你身陷囹圄
It'd be to get your ass thrown in jail.

960
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,680
你有律师代理权
See, you have power of attorney,

961
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,380
你会接受这项协议
and you're gonna accept this settlement,

962
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,910
每名原告两百万美金
$2 million a plaintiff.

963
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,130
你不得不接受
You're gonna take it.

964
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,560
然后带着你的谄媚嘴脸
And you and that shit eating grin

965
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,050
滚回波士顿
are gonna fly back to boston

966
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,990
从我的地盘上永远消失
and never come back to my town again.

967
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,070
你可以用我的
You can use mine.

968
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,650
说了他会签名
Told you I'd get his autograph.

969
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,300
真想不到
I can't believe you.

970
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,750
你居然会为了赢案子而作伪证
You were gonna perjure yourself just to win.

971
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,360
我以为你是有底线的
I thought you didn't cross lines.

972
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,440
而这正是你和他那种人的区别所在
That's the difference between guys like you and him.

973
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,360
我根本不会提交这份宣誓书
I had no intention of submitting this affidavit.

974
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,980
我不需要作伪证
I'm not gonna perjure myself,

975
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,400
但是坦纳不知道
but Tanner doesn't know that,

976
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,310
他也绝不会知道
and he never will.

977
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,440
你怎么知道
How do you know?

978
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,740
因为喜欢不按规矩办事的人
Because a man who's willing to break the rules

979
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,170
无法想象别人也不按规矩
can't imagine someone else wouldn't.

980
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,770
你说你是接受我的建议
You said that you took my advice

981
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,490
结果令你自己也很惊讶
and that you surprised yourself.

982
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,460
没错
I did.

983
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,180
为原告们申请的那笔贷款
That loan I got for the plaintiffs,

984
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,680
我自己先砸了一百万美金才拿到的
I put up a million dollars of my own money to get it.

985
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,580
如果这还不叫动感情
If that's not having emotion,

986
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,110
那我不知道情为何物了
I don't know what is.

987
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,400
-走开  -听着有点生气哈
- Get out. - That seemed a little angry.

988
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,690
开心  满意  还是高兴
Feeling good? Satisfied? Happy?

989
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,820
好吧
All right.

990
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,340
动情了
Emotional.

991
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,670
好吧  也许是有点开心
Okay, maybe a little happy.

992
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,040
两百万美金
$2 million?

993
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,230
不是告诉过你他可是我的得力干将吗
Didn't I tell you he was my right hand?

994
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,790
-我不知道该说什么  -无需多言
- I don't know what to say. - Don't say anything.

995
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,210
我只想知道大伙儿听到你的好消息后
Tell me what it's like

996
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,320
高兴的表情
when you deliver this news to everyone.

997
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,870
谢谢你
Thank you.

998
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,040
说了我会赢
Told you I'd win.

999
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,160
对你也是好事
And it's a good thing too.

1000
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,240
因为你要是输了...
Because if you hadn't, oh...

1001
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,120
什么
What, oh?

1002
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,900
那一百万美金可没法报销
There's no way we're gonna cover that million dollars.

1003
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,590
-都不能吗  -不行
- None of it? - Nope.

1004
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,340
你的肩膀怎么样了
Hey, how's your shoulder?

1005
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,840
再好不过
Amazing.

1006
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,300
你找我吗
You called me?

1007
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,370
当然
Sure did.

1008
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,520
请坐
Have a seat.

1009
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,070
我喜欢站着
I prefer to stand.

1010
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,670
也好
Fair enough.

1011
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,970
我犯了个错误
Uh, I made a mistake.

1012
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,400
你平白无故受罚
You were unfairly punished,

1013
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,940
而我想正式
and I would like to officially

1014
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,820
欢迎你回到公司
just welcome you back.

1015
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,480
-谢谢  -不用谢
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1016
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,710
你开玩笑吧
Are you kidding me?

1017
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,430
你觉得我会这么容易放过你吗
You think I'm gonna make it that easy on you?

1018
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,540
我要加薪
I want a raise.

1019
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,870
-百分之三  -百分之十
- 3%. - 10%.

1020
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,510
-百分之七  -百分之十
- 7%. - 10%.

1021
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,680
行
Fine.

1022
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,860
而且如果我决定上法学院
And Pearson Hardman pays for law school

1023
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,060
皮尔逊・哈德曼会报销学费
when I decide to go.

1024
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,500
同意
Agreed.

1025
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,160
还有一件事
And one more thing.

1026
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,080
这本该是我走进来时
This should've been the first words out of your mouth

1027
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,240
你说的第一句话
when I walked in here.

1028
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,720
你现在得向我道歉
You need to apologize to me right now,

1029
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,400
不然我明早一来
or I'm gonna file a lawsuit

1030
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,030
就让你吃官司
against you first thing in the morning.

1031
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,990
没错
You're right.

1032
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,980
我是该道歉
I should have apologized.

1033
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,300
但你威胁不了我
But don't you threaten me.

1034
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,770
我严格按程序办事
I followed procedure to the letter,

1035
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,060
你没理由诉讼
and you have no basis for a lawsuit.

1036
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,280
不  我是没有
No, I don't.

1037
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,030
这件事是没有
Not about this.

1038
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,380
但如果你认为我来公司的这些年
But if you don't think I have a basis

1039
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,390
你干的那摊烂事我一点把柄都没有的话
for all the shit you've pulled over the years I've been here,

1040
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,180
那么请再想想
