{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

17
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,550
而且我儿子也进过监狱
My son was in prisoned too. 

18
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,260
上面说你儿子死于心脏病
Says your son died of a heart attack.

19
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,750
他们一定隐瞒了我什么
There's something they're not telling me. 

20
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,340
那孩子
That kid?

21
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,090
他不会毫无理由就卷进打架事件
He didn't just up and get in a fight without good reason.

22
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,390
你不知道你在说什么
You don't know what you talking about.

23
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,650
-看守受贿了吗  -他只是死了
- Look, are the guards corrupt? - No! He just died!

24
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,320
我想让迈克放弃这个案子
I need Mike to drop that case.

25
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,840
你是在说  因为你客户在欺压你
You telling me to go back on my word

26
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,470
所以让我出尔反尔吗
because your client's bullying you?

27
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,370
这只是个无偿服务案  完全可以放弃
It's one pro bono. He can drop it.

28
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,340
我给你任务  你就得做
If I give you an assignment, you do it.

29
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,140
自从我来  就一直忍受路易的欺负
Since I got here, I have had to take shit from Louis.

30
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,870
你现在还要求我浪费时间精力
And now you're asking me to waste my time

31
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,060
在这种小事上面
and my ability on something like this.

32
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,990
我们不能让你开创先例
We can't have you setting a precedent

33
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,880
让亚历克斯的客户骑在我们头上作威作福
that Alex's clients can run roughshod all over us.

34
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,840
因为你生气的唯一原因是
The only reason that you're pissed about this

35
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,100
你的新猫友为我取消了和你的午餐
is your new honeysuckle friend canceled lunch on you for me.

36
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,330
我不能任由他们逃脱制裁
I can't let them get away with this

37
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,420
我要把这案子交给那个
without handing it off to the one lawyer I know

38
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,150
在乎这件事并且能办成的律师
who cares enough to see this thing through.

39
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,580
如果我们的律所和本案扯上任何关系
If our firm is associated with that case,

40
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,680
-都会失去一个大客户  -我不办它了
- we lose a huge client. - I'm not working on it.

41
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,750
那就出一份书面声明
Then you're gonna put that in writing 

42
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,620
而且要交给亚历克斯的客户
and you're gonna deliver it to Alex's client.

43
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,180
我想问问  瑞秋给你的任务
I was just wondering. Have you redone

44
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,800
你完成了吗
the assignment that Rachel gave you?

45
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,240
还没有  我的事情一大堆
Not yet. I had a ton on my plate.

46
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,030
你被解雇了
You're fired.

47
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,330
但我不提出让你在这儿办
What kind of best man would I be

48
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,100
还算哪门子好伴郎啊
if I didn't offer for you to have it here?

49
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,720
要我说  你不提就真的很不好了
Pretty shitty one, if you ask me.

50
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,970
-恭喜  -谢谢  哈维
- Congratulations. - Thanks, Harvey.

51
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,560
你确定他还没来
You sure he's not in?

52
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,120
我可不想撞见
I hate to walk in on the man

53
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,500
穿三角裤的男人
in his tighty-whities. 

54
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,560
我觉得哈维不穿三角裤
I don't think Harvey wears tighty-whities.

55
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
天呐  瑞秋
Oh, Jesus Christ, Rachel.

56
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
我可不想去想他穿什么
I don't wanna think about what the man wears.

57
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,510
好吧
Well...

58
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,220
你觉得如何
what do you think?

59
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,310
很棒
This is great!

60
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,030
如果你也是奔五十的单身汉
If you're a... Bachelor pushing 50

61
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,540
需要打动女人的话
and you need to impress women.

62
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,550
不不不  你干什么呢
No, no, no, no. What are you doing?

63
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,520
-别翻他的冰箱  -瑞秋
- Don't go in his fridge! - Rachel.

64
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,260
他都给我们钥匙了  相信我
The man gave us his keys. Trust me.

65
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,740
他知道我们会翻他的东西的
He knows we're gonna go through his shit.

66
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,130
那么你就是来看他都吃什么
So basically you came here to look at what he eats

67
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,980
然后说这里不适合办婚礼
and to say that this is a "No" for the wedding.

68
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,140
当然不适合  但是
Of course it's a no. But the fact is...

69
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,970
我们干吗要商量场地
why are we even talking venue at all

70
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,400
你们还没定下日子呢
when you don't even have a date?

71
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,450
我们会找时间商量的
We're gonna get around to that.

72
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,400
那么你
Just like you...

73
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,620
也会找时间宣布喜讯吗
got around to the announcement?

74
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,260
什么
What?

75
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,400
你母亲说她安排了一位摄影师
Your mother said that she arranged for a photographer,

76
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,980
但你取消了  花商也是
but you cancelled. Same with the florist.

77
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,390
-怎么回事  -没什么事
- What's going on? - Nothing is going on.

78
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,150
迈克和我现在都在
Mike and I are both really busy

79
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,270
忙于开启我们的事业
getting our careers off the ground right now.

80
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,690
瑞秋  问题就在这里
Rachel, that's just it.

81
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,420
如果你都没时间打理婚礼
If you can't focus on your wedding,

82
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,370
又怎么能有时间
how are you gonna make time to focus

83
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,930
打理婚姻
on your marriage?

84
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,750
这才是你来的原因  是吧
Now, that's why you came here, isn't it?

85
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,290
给我这样的好建议
To give me sweet advice like that.

86
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,640
还有告诉了不起的哈维・斯佩克特
Well, that, and to tell the mighty Harvey Specter

87
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,250
我试过了他的厕所
I took his toilet bowl for a test drive.

88
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,050
爸爸  不许那么做
Dad...you're not doing that.

89
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,110
你真是
You know how to suck 

90
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,970
会扫兴啊
the fun out of everything, don'tcha?

91
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,460
天呐
Oh, my God.

92
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,080
你  斯特芬妮呢
You. Where the hell is Stephanie?

93
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,200
-她不在  -什么意思
- She's not here. - What do you mean,

94
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,530
她不在  我刚挂了一个客户的电话
she's not here? I just got off the phone with a client, 

95
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,220
她没有替他们发撤销动议
and she never filed their motion to dismiss.

96
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,260
-我解雇了她  -什么
- That's because I fired her. - You what?!

97
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,080
她是我们最聪明的四年律师
She was the smartest fourth-year we had!

98
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,380
她也抗命  我做出了决定
She was also insubordinate, and I made a decision.

99
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,150
我才不管你做了什么
I don't give a shit what you made.

100
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,780
她正在德尔塔证券的案子上帮我
She was working for me on Delta Securities,

101
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,780
-我需要她回来  -路易
- and I need her back. - Okay, Louis,

102
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,210
我不会请她回来的
I'm not getting her back.

103
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,400
那样其他的律师
What kind of message does that send

104
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,950
-会怎么想  -总比现在
- to the other associates? - Better than the one

105
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,500
别人会想的强  那就是这家律所
we're sending out now which is that this firm

106
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,860
-就是个笑话  -路易  你得冷静下来
- is a Goddamn joke. - Louis, you need to calm down

107
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,640
别让这事往错误的方向发展
right now before this goes in the wrong direction,

108
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,770
因为这跟斯特芬妮无关
'cause this isn't about Stephanie.

109
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,040
而是因为塔拉
This is about Tara and the fact 

110
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,250
因为你一直没有去面对她
that you haven't been dealing with her.

111
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,510
这跟塔拉毫无关系
This has nothing to do with Tara. 

112
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,390
而是哈维要把律所开垮了
This is about Harvey running this firm into the ground.

113
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,850
他怎么那么做了
And how exactly has he been doing that?

114
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,820
我来给你说说  我气他
Let me run it down for you. I'm pissed at him.

115
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,100
迈克气他  上次我见到你时
Mike's pissed at him. And the last time I saw you,

116
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,410
你也气他  所以与其告诉我
you were pissed at him. So instead of telling me

117
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,290
你不打算把斯特芬妮雇回来
that you're not gonna hire Stephanie back,

118
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,700
你怎么不去告诉万能的主
why don't you go tell the lord God almighty

119
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,730
如果他不小心
that if he is not careful,

120
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,130
他就没有王国可以统治了
he's not gonna have a kingdom to rule over anymore!

121
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,410
-早  -哈维  我忙呢
- Morning. - Harvey, I'm sort of busy,

122
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,170
如果你是来打哈哈的
so if you're here to shoot the shit--

123
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,580
我是来给你这个的
I'm here to give you this.

124
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,180
-这是什么  -我的感谢
- What's this? - It's my way of saying thanks.

125
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,210
-谢什么  -你知道的
- For what? - You know what.

126
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,630
哈维  我放弃诉讼是因为你要求了我
Harvey, I dropped the suit because you asked me to.

127
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,530
你不用回报我什么
You don't have to give me anything in return.

128
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,820
有人教过你什么叫见好就收吗
Has anyone ever taught you how to be gracious?

129
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,270
打开文件
Open the file.

130
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,970
这是个无偿案
This's a pro bono.

131
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,750
我觉得你的一案
I figured you didn't get to complete

132
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,320
没能做完  这样才公平
your one-for-you this time, so it's only fair.

133
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,380
而且  你也不希望我告你
Plus, you didn't want me to sue you

134
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,150
-违背我们的协议  -罗宾如果
- for violating our agreement. - Doesn't look good

135
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,300
告蝙蝠侠违背合约可不好看
to have Robin coming after Batman for breach of contract.

136
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,140
老实说  迈克  我知道那对你很难
Seriously, Mike, I know how hard that was for you,

137
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,660
我不希望你和亚历克斯之间
and I don't want there to be any bad blood

138
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,980
有什么不睦
between you and Alex. 

139
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,380
我对亚历克斯没意见  哈维
I don't have a problem with Alex, Harvey. 

140
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,080
-真的  -真的
- You sure? - I'm sure.

141
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,460
-真的  -嗯  没事
- Sure? - Good. Yeah.

142
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,930
-真没事  -你走吧
- All good? - You should go.

143
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,090
我猜猜
Let me guess.

144
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,430
你做首席运营官做烦了  想我了
You're bored being C.O.O., you miss me,

145
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,160
想回来做我的秘书
and you want back on my desk.

146
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,900
我才不想回去做你的秘书  哈维
I never want back on your desk, Harvey,

147
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,660
而且我是来告诉你
and I'm here to tell you

148
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,010
你作为经营合伙人的蜜月期结束了
that your honeymoon as Managing Partner is over.

149
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,570
这是因为你在会议上
Is this about me not calling a vote

150
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,460
动摇我的威信之后我没要求投票吗
after you undermined me in that meeting?

151
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,020
我就不追究了这句了
I'm gonna let that go

152
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,190
因为你得明白  现在
because you need to understand that right now

153
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,180
-大家都在生你的气  -放松  唐娜
- people are mad at you. - Relax, Donna.

154
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,450
-我解决迈克了  -真好
- I took care of Mike. - Good for you.

155
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,730
-三个解决了一个  -或许你不知道
- You're one for three. - Maybe you didn't know this,

156
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,990
但这足以进入名人堂了
but that's good enough to get you into the Hall of Fame.

157
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,240
知道吗  哈维  与其这么傲慢
You know what, Harvey, instead of being so arrogant,

158
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,180
不如你可以想想怎么让我们所有人都开心
maybe you could figure out a way to keep all of us happy.

159
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,280
-首先就是你的二把手  -什么意思
- Starting with your number two. - What's that supposed to mean?

160
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,500
路易现在简直疯了
It means Louis is out of his mind at the moment.

161
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,850
而你又火上浇油  如果你现在
You poured fuel on the fire, and if you asked me

162
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,590
要我在你俩之间选一个经营合伙人
to choose between the two of you for Managing Partner right now,

163
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,730
我选亚历克斯・威廉姆斯
I'd choose Alex Williams.

164
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,390
-唐娜  -听我说  哈维
- Donna - Listen to me, Harvey.

165
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,910
如果让我做首席运营官
If making me C.O.O.

166
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,450
并不是为了让我开心
wasn't just some bullshit move

167
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,820
哄我的举动
to make me feel good,

168
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,510
你得别再犯浑了
you'll get your head out of your ass,

169
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,070
好好听我说
listen to what I'm telling you,

170
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,200
你要明白  你有麻烦了
and realize you've got a problem.

171
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,690
*看到钱  就愿意留下吃饭*
*See the money, wanna stay for your meal*

172
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,140
*给你太太再拿块馅饼*
*Get another piece of pie for your wife*

173
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,450
*所有人都想知道那感觉*
*Everybody wanna know how it feel*

174
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,820
*所有人都想见见那景象*
*Everybody wanna see what it's like*

175
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,100
*豆子馅饼我也愿吃  我不在乎*
*I'll even eat a bean pie, I don't mind*

176
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,020
*我和妹子忙着赚钱*
*Me and Missy is so busy, busy making money*

177
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,110
*好了*
*All right*

178
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,060
*退开点  我要跳舞*
*All step back, I'm 'bout to dance*

179
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,100
{\an8}诉讼双雄
第七季第四集

180
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,110
*美钞爵士摇摇摇*
*The greenback boogie*

181
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,750
哈维
Harvey.

182
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,460
杰西卡
Jessica.

183
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,350
看来退休之后过得不错啊
Retirement suits you.

184
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,710
-我没有退休  -你看起来像退休了
- I'm not retired. - You look retired.

185
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,200
我看起来很轻松  这二者是有区别的
I look relaxed. There's a difference.

186
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,240
怎么了  哈维
Now, what's going on, Harvey?

187
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,140
上一次你如此经常地飞芝加哥
The last time you flew to Chicago this often,

188
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,530
是迈克尔・乔丹还在队里的时候
Michael was still playing.

189
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,940
律所遇到麻烦了
I'm in a situation at the office.

190
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,220
遇到麻烦时  要做的第一件事
Well, the first thing to do when you're in trouble

191
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,130
就是向自己承认让自己陷于这种困境的错误
is admit to yourself what you did to get yourself there.

192
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,030
你觉得我做了什么错事
What do you think I did?

193
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,940
我和迈克做了约定  请他回来
I made a deal with Mike to come back.

194
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,420
我没经过深思熟虑就让唐娜当了合伙人
I made Donna a partner without thinking it through.

195
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,240
我违背路易的意愿雇用了一个人
I hired someone against Louis's wishes.

196
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,450
这一切相互交织在一起
And all those things are colliding with each other

197
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,700
导致"人人都恨哈维"
into a big pile of "People hate Harvey."

198
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,140
至少不是"人人都恨杰西卡"
Well, at least it's not a big pile of "People hate Jessica."

199
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,230
这就是你的建议吗
That's your advice?

200
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,570
不  不是
No. No.

201
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,050
哈维  我的建议是  给那个
Harvey, my advice is to give a big piece of new business

202
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,700
最不依不饶的人一个大任务
to the person least likely to let anything go.

203
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,180
-路易  -十有八九是他
- Louis. - Nine times outta ten.

204
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,900
我不能一夜之间就给他变出件任务
I can't just manufacture that overnight.

205
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,560
哈维  你还记得
Harvey, do you remember that time

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,330
我们从赞恩那里挖快步马系统那次吗
we poached Trotter Systems from Zane?

207
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,860
你一定是在逗我
You gotta be shitting me.

208
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,200
那次是预先安排好的交易吗
That was a prearranged deal?

209
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
我当时拼了老命去争取快步马
I worked my ass off to get Trotter.

210
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,920
确实
You did.

211
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,550
然后你就完全忘记你当时正因一件现在
And you completely forgot that you were pissed at me

212
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,560
咱们俩早都记不得的芝麻大点的事生我的气了
about some bullshit neither one of us can remember anymore.

213
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,510
-转移注意力  -没错
- Rook to Bishop four. - Exactly.

214
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,740
好了  快看菜单  我饿死了
Now, take a look at your menu, 'cause I'm starving.

215
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,820
你觉得我什么时候才能
When, exactly, do you think

216
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,870
不再为这些事情来找你请教
I'm gonna stop coming to you with these things?

217
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,760
实际上  哈维
The truth is, Harvey,

218
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,530
你根本就不需要再来找我了
you don't need to come to me anymore.

219
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,660
你来找我只是因为你想我了
You just do it 'cause you miss me.

220
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,410
我能找你说两句话吗
Can I talk to you for a second?

221
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,780
可以啊  但我只有几分钟时间
Yeah. But I only have a few minutes.

222
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,880
我要上庭
I have court.

223
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,520
我今早和我爸去了哈维的公寓
I met with my dad at Harvey's apartment this morning.

224
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,210
让我猜猜
Don't tell me.

225
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,620
他说他的宝贝女儿
He said a bachelor pad

226
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,620
绝对不能在一间单身公寓里
is no place for his special little girl

227
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,860
庆祝她的婚礼大日子
to celebrate the biggest day of her life.

228
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,010
迈克  你得承认
Well, Mike, you have to admit

229
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,770
我们放弃在时代广场办的唯一原因
the only reason that we changed it from the Plaza in the first place

230
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,840
就是我们不想引人注目
was because we didn't want the attention.

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,820
但既然如今你已经成为了一名合法律师...
But now that you're a legitimate lawyer...

232
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,350
我们就不用担心那一点了
we don't have to worry about that.

233
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,140
瑞秋  你说了算
Rachel, it's okay.

234
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,400
我只想让你开开心心的
I just want you to be happy.

235
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,680
-所以你不生气  -完全不会
- So you're not mad. - Not at all.

236
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,720
棒  因为要定在时代广场
Good. Because now that it is at the Plaza,

237
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,750
所以我打了电话给婚礼团队
I called and made an appointment with the wedding team

238
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,370
预约了看婚礼菜单
for us to go over some menu options.

239
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,380
等等  等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait.

240
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,120
你在我答应到现在的一秒钟间做了预约
You made an appointment in between when I said it was okay a second ago and now?

241
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,830
是啊  你没有看到吗
Yeah, y-you didn't just notice me do that?

242
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,880
-我速度超快的  -你真的超快
- It was crazy fast! - You're fast.

243
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,990
迈克  说真的  谢谢你这么体贴
Mike, seriously, I appreciate you being so understanding.

244
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,340
预约在今晚7点
The appointment is tonight at 7:00.

245
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,410
瑞秋  今晚我的公益诉讼有个会议
Rachel, I have a meeting tonight with my pro bono,

246
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,880
我不能推掉
and I can't put it off.

247
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,860
你一个人去可以吗
Can you do this one without me?

248
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,310
当然可以  但我希望我俩能一起去
Of course I can, but I wanted us to do it together.

249
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,590
瑞秋  听我说
Rachel, listen to me.

250
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,980
我了解你
I know you...right?

251
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,410
你会有上千个问题
You're gonna have a thousand questions.

252
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,270
你会想缩小选择范围
You're gonna want to narrow down the choices.

253
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,740
我保证以后我都会去的
I promise you I will be at every other meeting.

254
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,610
好吧  我会搞定的
Okay. I'll take care of it.

255
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,670
-好的  爱你  -我也爱你
- All right. Love you. - Love you, too.

256
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,810
怎么不穿你的男人装
Why aren't you playing from the men's tees?

257
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,800
假如你来说服我
If you're here to insist

258
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,190
同意让我女儿去你的爱巢里举办婚礼的
that my daughter gets married in that love shack of yours,

259
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,120
那就省省吧
that ship has sailed.

260
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,230
就算她在泰姬陵举办婚礼我也不在乎
Oh, I don't care if she gets married at the Taj Mahal.

261
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,500
我是听从杰西卡的安排来找你的
I'm here to take you up on Jessica's arrangement.

262
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,810
是嘛  什么安排
Yeah. What arrangement was that?

263
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,450
你帮我一个忙
The one where you do me a favor

264
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,050
我回报你一个大忙
and I give you a big one in return.

265
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,180
你以为我拱手让卡特里娜・班尼特
What the hell do you think letting Katrina Bennett and Company

266
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,020
和公司投奔你算什么
walk over to you without a fight was?

267
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,680
我没有要你那样做
I didn't ask you to do that.

268
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,420
我不在乎你有没有要求我
I don't care whether you asked me or not.

269
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,640
这个季度收益不好
It's been a thin quarter,

270
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,460
我也不是什么圣诞老人
and I'm no Goddamn Santa Claus.

271
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,760
-罗伯特  -好了  哈维
- Robert. - Okay, Harvey.

272
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,680
你想要我帮你是吧  那我就帮你个忙
You want a favor? I'll give you one.

273
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,630
与其让我救济你
Instead of you asking me for a handout,

274
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,100
不如自己小心
you should watch your backside,

275
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,310
因为有颗导弹直冲着你来了
because you've got a missile coming straight for you.

276
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,670
布莱顿・古尔德
Bratton Gould.

277
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,130
没错  布莱顿・古尔德
Yes. Bratton Gould.

278
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,060
你觉得在你从他们眼皮子底下
What'd you think they were gonna do

279
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,560
挖走了他们的高级合伙人和招牌客户
when you took their senior partner and marquee client

280
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,990
他们会怎么做
out from under their noses? 

281
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,230
我早就知道他们会报复
I knew they'd try to retaliate,

282
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,210
但我没想到会这么快
but I didn't think it would happen this fast.

283
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,520
就是今天了
Well, today's the day.

284
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,590
我告诉你吧
Let me tell you something.

285
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,110
我一点都不喜欢他们
I have no love for them.

286
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,940
所以我会尽全力帮你忙
So I'll do whatever I can to help.

287
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,970
但如我所说  这个季度收益不好
But like I said, it's been a thin quarter.

288
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,720
所以我是不会让你抢走我的客户的
And I'm not letting you get one of my clients.

289
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,540
奥利佛  你在这里干什么
Oliver. What are you doing here?

290
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,210
-我得和你谈谈  -假如是案子的事
- I need to talk to you. - If it's about the case,

291
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,220
我不能和你谈  你清楚的
I can't do that, and you know it.

292
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,250
拜托了  只要一分钟就好
Please, I just need a minute.

293
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,510
奥利佛  我们签了协议的
Oliver, we signed an agreement.

294
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,350
我不能这么做
I can't be doing this.

295
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,610
再说了  我还有别的案子
Not to mention I have other cases.

296
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,360
警卫的证词不符合他们对事件的描述
The guard's testimony doesn't match their version of events,

297
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,770
我还拿不出证据
and I can't prove it. 

298
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,650
什么意思
What do you mean?

299
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,570
监狱声称医生就在室内
The prison claims the doctor was on the premises.

300
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,080
狱警却说他们得打电话找他
The guard says they had to call him.

301
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,160
我要求提供监控录像
I asked for surveillance video

302
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,230
看他当时是否在那儿
to see if he was already there.

303
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,110
他们说不方便透露
They said they can't disclose it

304
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,820
因为有违《健康保险携带和责任法》
because it would violate HIPAA rules.

305
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,130
该死  那停车场的监控录像呢
Shit. What about surveillance of the parking lot? 

306
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,350
他们说那段录像已经没了
They're saying that footage is gone.

307
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,700
那他们肯定有所隐瞒
Then they're definitely hiding something.

308
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,790
可我拿不出证据
But I can't prove it.

309
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,480
如果拿不到新证据
And if I don't get something,

310
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,380
我就没办法推进此案
I can't move forward with this case.

311
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,670
听着  奥利佛  我说过了
Listen, Oliver, like I said,

312
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,200
我不能讨论此案
I can't discuss this case.

313
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,650
但是我可以告诉你
What but what I can tell you is that

314
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,280
如果你能让人相信你掌握了某些情况
if you can convince someone that you already have something,

315
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,100
这样才能让他们坐下来商量
that's the best way to get them in the room.

316
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,270
我明白了  骗他们说我有医生的考勤卡
I get it--I convince them I have the doctor's time card,

317
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,060
证明他不在那个地方
and he was nowhere near that place,

318
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,040
-他们就会和解  -我说过了
- I can get them to settle. - Like I said,

319
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,520
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

320
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,190
不和你说话真好  迈克
Good not talking to you, Mike.

321
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,340
哈维  我们得谈谈  就现在
Harvey, we need to talk, and it can't wait.

322
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,450
那边走边说  因为布莱顿准备
Then walk with me, because Bratton's getting ready

323
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,570
挖我们的客户  得告诉路易才行
to poach our clients, and Louis needs to know.

324
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,590
他已经知道了
He already knows.

325
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,020
他们在打德尔塔证券的主意
They're making a play for Delta Securities,

326
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,760
-而且绝不仅此  -我猜猜
- and that's not their only move. - Don't tell me.

327
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,260
他们还准备挖我的客户
They're coming after my clients too.

328
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,570
AC科技
AC Technologies.

329
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,270
可是  哈维  他们没想挖人
But, Harvey, they're not trying to poach.

330
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,800
他们准备以专利侵权提起诉讼
They're suing for patent infringement.

331
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,830
该死
Aw, shit!

332
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,620
路易  不管你要怎么留住德尔塔证券
Louis, whatever you're doing to keep Delta Securities,

333
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,850
都先等等  我有话
take a breath. I need you to listen

334
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,990
-要告诉你  -我不想再听你的话了
- to what I have to say. - Oh, I'm done listening to you.

335
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,000
你想把这间律所折腾黄
You wanna manage this firm into the ground,

336
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,830
随便你  但是当你的鬼话
you go right ahead. But when your bullshit

337
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,740
让我快要丢掉最大的客户之一时
puts one of my biggest clients on the block,

338
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,910
就别指望我乖乖听话了
that's when I'm done playing good soldier.

339
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,450
听我说  布莱顿不仅想对付
Listen to me. Bratton's not just coming

340
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,710
我们的客户  他们想分而治之
after our clients--they're trying to divide and conquer.

341
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,920
你当你是谁啊  凯撒大帝吗
What are you, Caesar now?

342
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,650
这里又不是罗马帝国
This isn't the Roman Empire.

343
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,630
我不管是什么  你觉得这是巧合吗
I don't care what it is. You think it's a coincidence

344
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,870
他们让你忙于应付你的客户的同时
they're forcing you to close on one of your clients

345
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,890
而以专利侵权对我的客户提起诉讼
while suing one of mine for patent infringement?

346
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,610
你是说我留不住我的客户吗
You're saying I can't keep my own clients?

347
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,330
路易  他是说你们应该互换客户
Louis, all he's saying is you should switch clients

348
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,820
-发挥你的强项  -我不同意
- and play to your strengths. - Pass!

349
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,670
听着  我明白  你不想哈维帮你
Look, I get it-- you don't want Harvey's help

350
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,680
因为你在生他的气
because you're mad at him. 

351
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,430
但你至少可以去找亚历克斯
But the least you can do is to go Alex. 

352
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,010
他在布莱顿待过  他了解他们的战术
He came from Bratton. He knows their playbook. 

353
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,640
我不需要知道他们的战术
I don't need their playbook.

354
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,870
就是因为他  他们才对我们
And he's the reason they're coming after us

355
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,190
-展开报复的  -好吧  路易
- in the first place. - Okay, Louis,

356
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,870
你看着办吧
you do it your way.

357
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,200
但是你最好做好充足准备
But you better be good and ready,

358
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,860
因为布莱顿对你这个
because Bratton knew enough

359
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,230
一年前就差点丢掉的客户了如指掌
to come after a client you almost lost a year ago

360
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,450
而对我的客户提起诉讼的理由
and to sue mine for something

361
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,790
我都还不清楚
I don't know anything about.

362
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,980
也就是说他们在这里安插了内应
Which means they've got someone inside this place

363
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,580
给他们指了方向
telling them what to do.

364
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,930
路易  我能跟你谈谈吗
Louis, can I talk to you for a second?

365
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,410
不行  因为我正要...
No, you can't, because right at this moment--

366
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,040
我知道  你要去见德尔塔证券的人
I know, you're gonna meet Delta Securities.

367
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,030
哈维已经明确的告诉我
And Harvey already made it clear

368
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,130
你不想让我帮你留住他们
you don't want my help trying to keep them.

369
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,620
-但是有些话...  -没有但是  亚历克斯
- But I have something-- - No buts, Alex.

370
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,660
我不想让你帮我  什么帮助都不要
I don't want your help. I don't want whatever you have,

371
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,730
因为我不信任你
because I don't trust ya. 

372
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,270
信任我  你到底什么意思
Trust me? What the hell are you talking about? 

373
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,520
说不定  你就是那个把我们的
For all I know, you were the one who gave Bratton

374
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,270
内部消息透露给布莱顿的内奸
the inside information on us in the first place.

375
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,100
好吧  路易  如果你真这么想
You know what, Louis, if you think that,

376
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,200
那你现在何不当场解雇我
then why the hell don't you fire me right now?

377
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,870
如果我能做主  亚历克斯  我会的
If it were up to me, Alex, I would.

378
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,470
法官大人  我不管他们怎么说
Your Honor, I don't care what they say.

379
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,610
我们先于他们提交了专利申请
We filed our patent before they did.

380
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,860
你先到的终点
Well, beating someone off the line

381
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,900
并不意味着你就没有抢跑
doesn't mean that you didn't jump the gun to do it.

382
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,360
我们的损失与日俱增
And our losses are growing by the day.

383
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,400
斯佩克特先生  你将上庭对其进行辩驳
Mr. Specter, you'll have your chance to refute him at trial.

384
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,980
好吧  听着  你想听实话
All right, listen, you want me to be honest?

385
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,110
我感觉最近被冷落了
I haven't felt prioritized lately.

386
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,070
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

387
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,320
你07年重组时是谁在帮你
Who was there when you had to restructure in '07?

388
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,880
更别提  我去年刚帮了你大忙
Not to mention, I just saved your ass last year.

389
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,410
那已经过去了  现在我觉得
And that was then. And now I feel like

390
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,950
我都打不通你电话
I can't even get you on the phone anymore.

391
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,280
-法官大人...  -别说了
- Your Honor-- - That's enough.

392
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,130
我认为沃尔什先生提交的证据
I find the evidence Mr. Walsh is presenting

393
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,200
足已向前推进此案
compelling enough to let this go forward.

394
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,050
只有一个问题  法官大人
There's only one problem with that, Your Honor.

395
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,260
我们刚挖走他们一个合伙人和其所有客户
We just took one of their partners, all of his clients. 

396
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,130
他们为此很恼火
They're pissed about it,

397
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,370
现在是想实施报复
and now they want some get-back.

398
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,800
你愿意把你手机号给我
You being willing to give me your phone number

399
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,820
并不是重点  路易
isn't the point, Louis. 

400
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,960
但它应该是
Well, it should be.

401
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,950
-你是谁  -他是亚历克斯・威廉姆斯
- Who are you? - This is Alex Williams,

402
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,560
我们新晋的高级合伙人
our newest senior partner,

403
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,030
他只是路过  亚历克斯...
and he was just stopping by. Alex--

404
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,700
我不仅是新晋的高级合伙人  蒂姆
I'm not just the newest senior partner, Tim.

405
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,370
我之前是布莱顿・古尔德律所的合伙人
I'm also the partner that Bratton Gould just lost.

406
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,540
法官大人  他们昨天和家公司
Your Honor, they entered into

407
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,730
签署了一个付费豁免合作协议
a fee-waiving partnership agreement yesterday

408
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,950
这家公司今天突然声称
with a company that's suddenly claiming infringement

409
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,520
我们客户侵犯了他们的权益 
against one of our clients today.

410
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,460
法官大人  他们客户的确造成了损失
Your Honor, their client caused real damages.

411
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,320
如果是这样  八周后这些损失也会出现
If that's true, those damages will still be there in eight weeks,

412
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,200
也就是说你现在不安的唯一原因
which means the only reason you'd be upset right now

413
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,520
就是你的诉讼没有理由
is if this action is nonsense.

414
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,070
所以你是选择八周时间  还是放弃诉讼
So which is it-- eight weeks or drop the case?

415
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,550
莫瑞里近三年的开支报表
Morelli's expense reports for the last three years.

416
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,860
他比大卫・布莱恩在维加斯的时间都长
The guy spends more time in Vegas than David Blaine. 

417
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,860
{\an8}著名魔术大师

418
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,270
现在你知道了
And now you know.

419
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,660
正如你已经知道的
Just like you already know

420
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,280
不管路易接不接你电话
that Louis kills for you out there

421
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,210
都会帮你把事情搞定
whether he's taking your calls or not.

422
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,600
我明天打电话和你谈收购的事  路易
I'll call you tomorrow about the acquisition, Louis.

423
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,680
谢谢你  蒂姆
Thank you, Tim.

424
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,380
干得漂亮  用合伙人协议对付他们
Nice move, finding out about that partnership agreement.

425
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,690
告诉客户
Nice move telling our client

426
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,690
最后一个季度不收费这招也不错
he's not gonna be billed for last quarter.

427
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,820
没什么能比口袋里的钱更能抚平
Nothing eases the pain of a bullshit lawsuit

428
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,100
狗屁诉讼带来的伤痛了
like cash in your pocket. 

429
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,000
说到这个  我已经回来工作三周了
Speaking of which, I've been back at work for three weeks now.

430
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,470
我觉得是时候给我加薪了
Thinking it's time I got a raise.

431
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,760
慢慢来  小老虎
Easy, tiger.

432
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,020
迈克  说正经的
Mike, seriously,

433
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,990
我以为你忙着做你的无偿服务的案子
I thought you were busy with that pro bono.

434
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,190
是这样的  唐娜说你需要我的帮忙
I am. Donna said you needed my help,

435
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,660
所以我就来帮忙了
so...I gave it to you.

436
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,270
谢了  罗宾
Thanks, Robin.

437
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,890
别客气  蝙蝠侠
Ah, you're welcome, Batman.

438
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,870
路易  真的...
Louis, really...

439
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,140
-你没必要如此  -什么  开玩笑吗
- you didn't have to do this. - What, are you kidding?

440
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,530
你在我那么混蛋的对你后你还救了我
You saved me after I was an asshole.

441
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,280
-你也没必要那么做  -我有
- You didn't have to do that. - Yes, I did.

442
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,800
因为我不在乎你做出什么举动
Because I don't care how you acted.

443
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,330
我们现在在同一条船上
We're all in the same boat now.

444
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,880
我想是的
I guess we are.

445
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,250
天  你是真的不爱你的旧律所是吗
Boy, you really...have no love for your old firm, do you?

446
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,820
说实话
If I'm being truthful with you,

447
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,280
只要我在那儿  就永远到不了
I was never gonna get where I wanted to be

448
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,740
我想要的位置
as long as I was there.

449
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,760
-冠名合伙人  -冠名合伙人
- Name partner. - Name partner.

450
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,450
说实话  我考虑过离开皮尔逊・哈德曼
You know, I thought of leaving Pearson Hardman at one point. 

451
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
胡扯
Bullshit.

452
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,280
不  是真的
No, it's the truth.

453
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,200
猎头什么的一切我都准备好了
I even got a headhunter and everything.

454
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,010
-我还以为你爱那里  -我爱
- I thought you loved it there. - I do.

455
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,410
但这不代表我感受不到不被赏识和忽视
Doesn't mean that I didn't feel unappreciated and overlooked.

456
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,640
很难相信有人能忽视你
I find it hard to believe anyone could overlook you.

457
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,880
有的  我就想...
Well, they did, and I got to thinking...

458
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,080
我可以成为世界上最好的律师...
I can be the best lawyer in the world, and...

459
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,850
也不会改变他们对我的看法
it won't change how they see me.

460
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,470
当冠名合伙人之神降临
Like you must have been out sick or something

461
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,030
决定冠名合伙人的那天
the day the name partner gods came down

462
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,670
你肯定就生病不在
saying who's gonna make it up the God damn mountain.

463
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,540
正是那种感觉
That's exactly right, 

464
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,110
结果我那天并没有生病  你也不会
and it turns out I wasn't sick that day, and neither were you.

465
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,530
如果你觉得又被忽视了
And if you ever feel overlooked again,

466
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,830
我希望你能来找我
I would hope that you can come to me

467
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,200
我可以帮你解决
so I can help fix it.

468
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,960
对我意义重大  路易
Means a lot to me, Louis.

469
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,850
不用
Well...

470
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,690
如你所说
like you said...

471
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,120
我们是同一条船上的人了
We're all in the same boat now.

472
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,700
瑞秋  你有空吗  我需要你的帮助
Rachel, do you have a minute? I need your help. 

473
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,510
当然有  怎么了
Yeah, of course. What's going on? 

474
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,480
我认为斯蒂芬妮・帕特尔
I think Stephanie Patel

475
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,240
可能在帮布莱顿挖我们的客户
may be helping Bratton poach our clients.

476
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,870
什么  斯特芬妮什么时候去布莱顿的
What? Since when is Stephanie at Bratton?

477
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,490
今天早上  说来话长了
Since this morning, and it's a long story,

478
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,790
但是有人把我们的内部消息给了他们
but someone gave them inside information about us,

479
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,820
又鉴于她刚刚去了那里
and given that she just started...

480
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,760
我需要你去那
I need you to go over there,

481
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,320
务必阻止她
and I need you to get her to stop.

482
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,860
我  我怎么阻止
Me? How am I supposed to do that?

483
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,210
就是让她复职都可以
I don't care if it means offering her her job back.

484
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,880
但是无论怎样  必须是在今晚
But whatever it is, it has to happen tonight.

485
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,040
等等  唐娜  你不是认真的吧
Wait, Donna, you can't be serious right now.

486
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,760
这是我们唯一的办法...
It's the only way that we-- 

487
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,790
唐娜  路易羞辱了她  你解雇了她
Donna, Louis eviscerated her, and you fired her. 

488
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,980
她是不可能再回来的
There's no way she's ever coming back here. 

489
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,580
不一定
You don't know that.

490
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,680
更不用说我今晚和婚礼策划师
Not to mention the fact that I have a meeting this evening

491
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,440
预约了见面  所以...
with the wedding planner, so-- - 

492
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,770
我不管你今晚有什么计划  我们得做点什么
I don't care what you have tonight. We need to do something,

493
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,250
而且现在就得动手
and we need to do it now.

494
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,040
好吧  到底怎么回事
Okay. What's going on?

495
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,960
哈维给了我个机会  瑞秋
Harvey took a chance on me, Rachel.

496
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,460
他冒了天下之大不韪
He went out on a limb,

497
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,260
现在我被提拔到了一个别人认为
and now I have been promoted to a position

498
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,650
我还没准备好的位置
that people think I'm not ready for.

499
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,000
我的话不是那个意思
I didn't mean it when I said that.

500
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,040
我知道  但如果我做的第一件事
I know that. But if one of the first things I did 

501
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,190
就给了布莱顿搞垮律所的机会
ends up giving Bratton a roadmap to picking this firm apart,

502
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,970
我永远都不会原谅自己的
I will never forgive myself.

503
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,580
斯蒂芬妮可能会不理你
And Stephanie might not talk to you,

504
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,300
但她一定不会理我的
but I know she won't talk to me.

505
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,650
好
Okay.

506
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,970
我去见她  唐娜
I'll go see her, Donna.

507
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,500
在我回去忙我的案子之前
Anything else you want me to fix for you

508
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,080
还有什么需要我帮你的
before I get back to my case? 

509
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,670
-见了路易之后告诉你  -什么意思
- I'll let you know after I see Louis. - What do you mean?

510
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,900
意思是如果他没能阻止布莱顿挖他的客户
I mean if he couldn't stop Bratton from poaching his client, 

511
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,700
我们刚刚所做的只会让我们陷入两难
us doing what we just did only gives us a split decision. 

512
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,800
但你说路易明确表示不要你的帮助
But you said Louis made it clear he doesn't want your help.

513
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,690
他也许不想要
He may not want it,

514
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,220
但是如果这破事没有处理好
but if that shit's not taken care of,

515
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,290
不管他喜不喜欢  他都得接受帮助
he's getting it whether he likes it or not.

516
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,810
路易  在你再次对我大发雷霆前...
Louis, before you jump down my throat again--

517
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,660
镇定  哈维  我不生你的气了
Relax, Harvey, I'm not upset with you anymore.

518
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,590
实际上  亚历克斯搞定德尔塔证券后
In fact, I even came to an agreement with Alex

519
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,840
我和他甚至达成了共识
after he locked up Delta Securities.

520
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,080
-很好  -你呢
- Good. - What about you?

521
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,050
你的案子需要我帮忙吗
Do you need my help with your lawsuit?

522
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,100
解决了  别告诉他我说过这种话
It's taken care of. Don't tell him I said this,

523
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,680
但是迈克冲进他的电话亭
but Mike jumped inside his phone booth

524
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,550
换上了他的超人装救人了
and put on his Superman outfit.

525
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,770
那很好  所以我想...
Oh, that's great. So I guess...

526
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,250
这意味着你现在就剩一件事要做了
this means there's only one thing left for you to do.

527
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,570
我觉得是我们现在就剩一件事要做了
Well, I'd say there's only one thing left for us to do.

528
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,340
你想让我和你一起去吗
You want me to go with you?

529
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,730
你的名字也在墙上  不是吗
Your name's up on that wall, isn't it?

530
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,900
看来你有自己的办公室了
I see you got your own office.

531
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,560
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

532
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,080
我知道你觉得在皮尔逊-斯佩克特不受重视
I know that you didn't feel valued at Pearson Specter,

533
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,430
我想为我在这件事上的责任向你道歉
and I wanted to apologize for my part in that.

534
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,380
我还想让你知道
I also just--I wanted you to know

535
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,740
让你被解雇并不是我的本意
that it was never my intention to get you fired.

536
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,140
我希望你不是来这里要雇我回去的
I hope you're not here to offer me my job back.

537
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,950
-如果我说是呢  -我会拒绝
- And what if I said I was? - I'd say I wouldn't take it.

538
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,340
好吧  既然如此
Okay... in that case,

539
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,480
我是来查明
I am here to find out

540
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,970
是不是你将保密信息告诉了你的新公司
if you're giving your new firm privileged information.

541
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,200
让我理一理
Let me get this straight.

542
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,340
你解雇了我
You have...the nerve to fire me

543
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,940
还敢跑到这儿来指责我
and then come here and accuse me

544
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,110
破坏了律师-委托人保密特免权
of breaking attorney-client privilege?

545
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,540
否则你的事务所怎么会知道这么多
How else is your firm getting so much information

546
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,100
关于我们正在进行的案子的事情
on our on-going cases? 

547
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,660
你以为只有我对你们事务所心怀怨恨吗
You think I'm the only person with a grudge against your firm?

548
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,230
哈维・斯佩克特早就对这里宣战了
Harvey Specter declared war on this place

549
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,860
当时我还没来这里
long before I got here.

550
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,170
何止是我没给他们信息
And not only am I not giving them information,

551
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,800
他们根本不需要我的帮助  也没让我帮他们
they don't need my help, and they didn't ask for my help.

552
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,180
我们说清楚  斯特芬妮  你以前跟我撒过谎
Just to be clear, Stephanie, you've lied to me before.

553
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,580
打破律师-委托人保密特免权
And breaking attorney-client privilege

554
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,460
会被踢出律师协会的
is a dis-barrable offense,

555
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,340
如果我们找出来这里发生了什么
and if we find out that's what's been happening here--

556
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,670
不  瑞秋  我没对你说谎
No, Rachel, I didn't lie to you.

557
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,410
像你说的  我利用了一个漏洞
Like you said, I used a loophole.

558
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,880
因为我是个好律师  也坚守职业道德
'Cause I'm a good lawyer, and I'm also an ethical lawyer.

559
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,960
如果这家事务所获得了皮尔逊-斯佩克特
So if this firm is getting inside information

560
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,250
的内部信息
from Pearson Specter,

561
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,010
他们也不是从我这里得到的
they're not getting it from me.

562
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,820
迈克  等等
Hey, Mike, wait up.

563
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,980
奥利佛  你在这做什么
Oliver, what are you doing here?

564
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,890
我在等你一起喝啤酒啊
I was just waiting for you so we can grab that beer

565
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,730
我们说好的
like we talked about. 

566
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,190
-我们没说要喝...  -跟我走就是了
- Except we didn't talk about grabbing-- - Just walk with me.

567
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,640
见鬼  奥利佛  我说过...
God damn it, Oliver, I told you-- 

568
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,730
放松  迈克  都结束了  吓唬他们起效了
Mike, relax. It's over. The bluff worked.

569
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,690
起效了是什么意思
What do you mean, it worked?

570
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,620
我拿到了一个赔偿金额  很不错
I got a number, and it's good.

571
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,960
见鬼
Shit.

572
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,910
怎么了
What?

573
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,560
这个金额何止是不错  简直好得离谱
This offer's not just good. It's too good.

574
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,150
你在说什么  你觉得他们不会付钱吗
What're you talking about? You think they're not gonna pay? 

575
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,760
我是说  这个金额不只是想让你停手
I mean this isn't the number you give to make someone go away.

576
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,780
而是想让你不得不停手
It's a number you give when you need them to go away.

577
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,460
你是说你觉得还有更多这样的案件
You're saying you think there's more cases like this out there. 

578
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,340
我是说  这种举动暗示着背后隐藏了更多东西
I'm saying that when someone acts like this, there's more to find.

579
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,070
也就是说  你要说服雷耶斯先生
Which means you need to convince Mr. Reyes

580
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,110
拒绝赔偿  继续调查
to turn this down and keep looking.

581
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,690
你是认真的吗  迈克
Are you serious, Mike? 

582
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,570
这家人从来没见过这么多钱
This is more money than this family's ever seen.

583
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,310
而你要说服他们...
And you convince them--

584
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,660
什么  我要找出其他这种案子吗
What? That I'm gonna find all those other cases?

585
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,780
我已经吓唬他们一次了  迈克
I already bluffed 'em once, Mike.

586
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,400
这案子能办成功的唯一原因
And the only reason we were able to make this case

587
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,920
是我们威胁要针对具体个案发起诉讼
is because we threatened to sue them over a specific guy. 

588
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,530
那就去问每一个从那里出来的人
Then knock on the door of everyone that has come out of that place

589
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,240
-找到更多的受害者  -迈克
- and find more guys. - Mike...

590
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,360
如果还有其他受害者
If there are other victims out there,

591
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,370
我很同情他们
I feel for them.

592
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,240
但我代表的是奥斯卡  他在受苦
But I'm representing Oscar. He's suffering.

593
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,880
让他拒绝的话  我会过意不去的
And I don't feel right telling him not to do this.

594
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,680
所以  如果你想这样做
So if you want this done,

595
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,210
你就只能靠自己了
you're gonna have to do it yourself.

596
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,340
瑞秋  请告诉我你让她停手了
Rachel, please tell me that you got her to back off.

597
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,710
不是她干的
It wasn't her. 

598
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,500
不是她干的是什么意思  除了她还能有谁
What do you mean, it wasn't her? It had to be her.

599
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,220
唐娜  我尝试了跟她道歉
Donna, I apologized to her.

600
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,540
然后威逼  然后相劝
I threatened her, and I cajoled her.

601
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,520
相信我  真的不是她
Trust me--it wasn't her.

602
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,510
瑞秋  我当时说不在乎你有什么约会
Rachel...look, I didn't mean that stuff

603
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,610
但我心里不是那么想的
that I said before about not caring about your appointment.

604
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,980
-我知道  -那你去成了吗
- I know. - Well, did you make it?

605
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,710
我不想让你白白错过约会
'Cause I'd hate to think you missed it for nothing.

606
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,880
我正要进门赴约呢  别担心
I'm walking in right now. Don't worry.

607
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,110
我正好赶上了
I'm right on time.

608
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,220
非常抱歉
Hi. I'm so sorry.

609
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,260
我是瑞秋・赞恩
Rachel Zane.

610
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,700
我是黛博拉・卡普兰
Deborah Kaplan.

611
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,730
我的助理把时间说错了吗
Did my assistant give you the wrong time?

612
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,050
我安排的时间是七点
Because I had us down for 7:00.

613
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,640
我知道  而现在都快八点了
And it's almost 8:00. I know.

614
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,560
工作上有个急事  需要我立刻处理
I had an emergency at work, and it couldn't wait.

615
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,420
但我想  这次见面时间是两个小时
But my understanding was it's a two-hour appointment.

616
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,320
所以我希望  能说多少算多少吧
So I was just hoping that we could go over as much as possible.

617
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,850
没问题
Of course.

618
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,490
实际上  通常第一个小时只不过是
The truth is, I usually take the first hour

619
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,860
我为客户端一杯香槟
to offer you a glass of champagne

620
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,570
然后互相认识的时间
and try to get to know you anyway.

621
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,470
但现在香槟还是冰的
But the champagne is still cold,

622
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,110
所以我们可以开门见山
and we can just dive right in.

623
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,700
汤米・布拉克斯顿
Tommy Braxton.

624
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,580
你还在为那座
You still double-billing

625
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,180
汉普顿斯的房子做兼职吗
to pay for that house in the Hamptons?

626
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,790
不  我在加班挣房钱
No. I'm working late to pay for it.

627
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,170
韦尔还有一栋房  还有巴黎的公寓
And the one in Vail and the apartment in Paris.

628
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,040
这家也太多了
That's a lotta homes.

629
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,990
听着像种惩罚
Sounds like a man who's compensating.

630
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,820
-你最近怎么样  哈维  -他很好
- So how're you doing, Harvey? - Oh, he's doing great.

631
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,480
因为我们刚刚叫停了你对我们事务所的侵犯
'Cause we just shut down your pathetic assault on our firm.

632
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,700
-真是这样吗  -你说对了  就是这样
- Is that so? - You're Goddamn right, that's so.

633
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,860
那我不妨问一下  你在这里做什么
Then might I ask what exactly are you doing here? 

634
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,690
我们是来告诉你  你要是再干这种鬼勾当
We're here to tell you that if you try this shit again,

635
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,990
这种事情要是再发生
the same thing's gonna happen,

636
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,150
我们就不只是守卫自己的事务所了
only next time, we won't just play defense.

637
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,950
我们要发起侵权诉讼  让你们赔
We'll hit you with a tortious interference suit

638
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,720
大约十亿美元
in the neighborhood of a billion dollars.

639
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,940
那你要准备好了
Well, you better get ready,

640
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,240
因为...现在就是下一次
'cause next time... starts right now.

641
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,710
你在开玩笑吧
What, are you kidding?

642
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,740
你们这次已经把东西都亮出来了
You already threw everything you had at us once.

643
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,450
-而且啥用没有  -不是所有东西
- Didn't make a dent. - Not everything.

644
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,150
到了明天早上  我要挖走二十个你的客户
By tomorrow morning, I'll be poaching 20 of your clients,

645
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,410
再起诉二十个他的客户
and I'll be suing another 20 of his.

646
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,420
今天你们在法庭玩的那个小把戏
And that little trick you played in the courtroom today? 

647
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,120
-明天就没用了  -汤姆  我明白你想说什么
- It isn't going to work tomorrow. - Tom, you made your point.

648
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,230
你很生气我们带去了亚历克斯
You're pissed off that we brought Alex over,

649
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,160
但你不用...
but this doesn't have to-- 

650
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,460
我才不在乎亚历克斯・威廉姆斯呢
I don't give two shits about Alex Williams.

651
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,680
律师到处都有
Lawyers grow on Goddamn trees.

652
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,030
我想要回我的客户
I want my clients back,

653
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,340
以及他们带来的
and I want the 30 million in billables

654
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,850
三千万律师费
that come along with them,

655
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,360
而且要你亲手奉上
hand-delivered...by you.

656
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,060
-这不可能  -你觉得呢  哈维
- That's never gonna happen. - What do you think, Harvey?

657
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,450
你觉得这不可能吗
Do you think that's "Never gonna happen"?

658
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,710
我说过  不管你怎么对付我们
Like I said, whatever you throw at us,

659
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,050
我们都会回击的
we'll throw it right the hell back.

660
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,510
你人手不够
With what manpower?

661
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,140
你要是想跟区域小事务所掐架
You wanna pick a fight with a little regional law firm

662
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,340
以显示你有多厉害  请便
to flex your muscles, go ahead.

663
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,990
但我们的规模是你们的五倍
But we're five times your size.

664
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,010
这架是你先挑起的
This is a fight you started.

665
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,570
可你也赢不了
And this is a fight that you cannot win.

666
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,500
把我的客户还给我
So you give me back my clients,

667
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,150
否则你在皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特的一番苦心
or your legacy at Pearson Specter Litt

668
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,890
将由你亲手
is going to be that you were the one

669
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,710
埋葬
that put them in the ground.

670
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,170
让我理一下
Let me get this straight.

671
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,370
这个条件给的钱  比我这辈子看到的钱都多
I got an offer for more money than I'll see my whole life,

672
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,970
结果你却想让我拒了
and you want me to turn it down

673
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,940
就因为你感觉说  发生在克里斯身上的事
based on a feeling that whatever happened to Chris

674
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,740
-也发生在了别人身上  -不是感觉
- happened to other people? - It's not a feeling.

675
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,570
是直觉
It's an instinct 

676
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,030
是研究了上百个这样的案子之后的直觉
that comes from working on hundreds of cases like this.

677
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,570
如果你接受了这个条件
And if you take this deal,

678
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,740
那你就永远也拿不到你想要的答案了
you're never gonna get the answers you want.

679
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,690
你永远也不会知道你儿子到底是怎么了
You'll never know what happened to your son.

680
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,680
可我还有一个儿子
And I have another son

681
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,810
两个女儿
and two daughters,

682
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,930
这笔钱  能改变他们的生活
and this changes their lives.

683
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,970
-雷耶斯先生  -你的意思是
- Mr. Reyes-- - Are you telling me

684
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,770
你能证明  他们和我儿子的死有关
that you can prove they had something to do with my son's death?

685
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,980
是的  我相信奥利佛可以找到足够的
Yes. I believe that Oliver can get enough to

686
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,630
不  不要奥利佛
No, not Oliver.

687
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,510
要你来  因为你才是接了我案子的人
You. Because you're the one who took my case,

688
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,370
-可你又退出了  -我跟你说了是因为利益冲突
- and then you backed out. - I told you, there was a conflict.

689
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,080
我不懂那是什么意思
I don't know what that means.

690
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,440
那现在就听我说
Then listen to me right now.

691
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,150
你知道我的父母死于一场车祸
I know that you know my parents died in a car accident.

692
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,540
但你不知道的是在他们死后
But what you don't know is that after they did,

693
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,380
有位律师找到我的奶奶
a lawyer...came to my grandmother

694
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,760
给她开了个条件
and made her an offer.

695
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,260
她接受了  没有上法庭
She took it, instead of going to court.

696
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,540
我告诉你
And I am telling you,

697
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,130
她为此后悔了一辈子
she regretted that for the rest of her life.

698
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,710
奥斯卡  多少钱都抚不平痛苦
Oscar, there's no price that'll make the pain go away.

699
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,100
那什么可以呢
Then what will?

700
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,570
竭尽全力
Doing everything you can

701
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,070
不让别人也感受到这种痛苦
to make sure no one else ever has to feel it too.

702
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,990
至少  这是我用过最好的办法了
At least, that's the closest I've ever gotten.

703
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,030
你觉得拒绝这个条件就能做到
And you think turning this down will do that.

704
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,670
我觉得克里斯已经去了  再也回不来了
I think Chris is gone and we can't ever bring him back,

705
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,640
所以这比钱或正义
which means this is about

706
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,390
来的更重要
more than just money or justice.

707
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,440
是要让那些像他一样的人不再死去
It's about stopping other people like him from dying.

708
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,980
而且我觉得这是能做到的  但...
And I think it can be done, but...

709
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,760
哪怕不行...
even if it can't...

710
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:43,930
我们也要试一试
we gotta try.

711
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,160
拒绝他们
Tell them no.

712
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,660
-哈维  怎么样了  -听我说
- Harvey, how'd it go? - Listen to me.

713
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,820
我之前觉得这本来不是什么事儿
I didn't think it mattered before,

714
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,840
但有人一直在透内部消息给他们
but they've got someone feeding them inside information.

715
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,370
我要知道这个人是谁
I need to know who it is.

716
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,980
已经着手在查了  哈维
I'm already working on it, Harvey.

717
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,300
很好  这是给你个机会来向大家证明
Good. 'Cause this is your chance to prove to everybody

718
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,670
我升你职是个正确的决定
I made the right decision giving you that promotion.

719
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,920
罗伯特
Robert.

720
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,270
我们得谈谈
We need to talk. 

721
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,390
按我听说的话  你得少谈话
From what I hear, you need to spend less time talking

722
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,150
多照看你的律所才是
and more time looking over your firm.

723
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:31,640
你也说了要是我需要帮忙  就跟你说一声
And you said if I needed help doing that to let you know.

724
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,910
行  谈吧
All right. Let's have it.

725
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,680
你需要什么
What do you need?

726
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,290
是你之前就跟杰西卡提过的
It's nothing you haven't proposed to Jessica before.

727
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,500
你一定是在逗我  你想合并
You gotta be kidding me. You want to merge?

728
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,040
我不是在说真的合并
I'm not talking about a real merger.

729
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,530
我是说放出话来
I'm talking about putting out word

730
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,540
说市里最好的两家律所
that two of the best firms in the city

731
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,790
要是市里最大的律所之一了
are now one of the biggest firms in the city.

732
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,700
你没有人手跟他斗  对么
You don't have the manpower to fight him, do you?

733
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,690
布莱顿现在是要搞军备竞赛  罗伯特
Bratton's making this an arms race, Robert.

734
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,750
哪怕我没有去打仗的人手
If I don't have the numbers to fight a war,

735
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,980
我也得看着像有那么回事才行
I have to at least make it look like I do.

736
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,790
-现在不行  哈维  -罗伯特  不过唱一出空城计
- I can't do it, Harvey. - Robert, it's a bluff.

737
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,030
可这空城计对我有百害而无一利
A bluff with nothing but downside for me.

738
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,330
并非如此  事成之后
That's not true. When this is over,

739
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,860
布莱顿那边带过来的客户
you can have your pick of the clients

740
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,630
-随你挑  -事成之后
- that came over from Bratton. - When this is over,

741
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,880
就会变成好像是我退出了合并
I'm gonna look like I backed away from a merger,

742
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,060
人家不信任我  更不用说
that I can't be trusted, not to mention

743
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,920
人家会以为我弱到
that I look like I'm so weak

744
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,810
要跟你这样一家举步维艰的律所合并
that I needed to merge with a struggling firm 

745
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,990
要以此为起点
like yours to begin with. 

746
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,430
-你就是这么看我们的  举步维艰  -哈维
- Is that what you think we are--struggling? - Harvey...

747
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,560
你要我答应这个
you need me to answer that...

748
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,130
就说明你还有比汤米・布莱顿更大的问题
then you've got an even bigger problem than Tommy Bratton.

749
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,240
哈维  拜托告诉我赞恩同意合并了
Harvey, please tell me Zane went for the merger idea.

750
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,370
-他不同意  -该死的  没有帮手我们就死定了
- He didn't. - Damn it! We're gonna drown without any help.

751
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,180
那就找
Then we'll get help.

752
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,320
不然你觉得我们在忙什么
What do you think we've been working on?

753
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,530
我以为你在找泄密的人
I thought you were trying to find the leak.

754
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,130
-本来是的  但找不出  -而且既然赞恩有可能会拒绝
- We were, but we can't. - And since Zane might say no,

755
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,840
我就试探性地接触了几个猎头
I put out some feelers with headhunters

756
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,980
看看能不能招几个初年律师和律师助理
to see about getting some first-years and paralegals.

757
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,980
可问题是  我们每个都至少需要24个人
The problem is, we need a minimum of 2 dozen each

758
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,610
才能撑住工作量  但这一年要
to handle the workload, but it's gonna run us

759
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,660
-花掉我们三百多万  -那就去问你在富达的朋友
- over 3 million a year. - Then we'll get a bridge loan

760
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,600
借个过渡贷款
from your guy at Fidelity. 

761
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,370
我们去年扩建42层的时候
We already used that line of credit last year 

762
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,030
已经把额度用完了
when we expanded the 42nd floor.

763
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,970
-妈的  -哈维  我们要怎么办
- Shit. - Harvey, what the hell are we gonna do?

764
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,710
-我一点办法都想不到  -我有个办法
- I don't see a way out of this. - I have a way out.

765
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,190
给他们想要的
Give them what they want.

766
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,010
我不会放弃你的客户的  亚历克斯
I'm not giving up your clients, Alex.

767
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,640
与其这么做  还不如放你走人
I do that, I might as well let you go.

768
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,950
那就放我走人  糟蹋了你的苦心经营
Then let me go, because I'm not gonna

769
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,690
这锅我可不背
be responsible for driving you in the ground.

770
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,480
-不  我不会这么做的  -为什么不做
- No, I'm not gonna do that. - Why the hell not?

771
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,030
因为你现在是我们的人了
Because you're one of us now.

772
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,040
我也同意
And I agree.

773
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,750
那我们现在怎么办
Well, what are we gonna do?

774
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,380
你要回去找出
You're gonna go back to finding out

775
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,460
到底是谁在透内部消息给他们
who's feeding them inside information,

776
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,960
你们俩负责搞清楚
and you two are gonna figure out

777
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,580
他们会先对哪个客户下手
who they're coming after first.

778
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,690
我要想一想怎么才能打赢这个混蛋
And I'm gonna figure out how to beat this son of a bitch.

779
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,180
迈克  怎么样
Mike, hey. How'd it go?

780
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,320
-他拒绝了  -感谢上帝
- He turned the offer down. - Thank God.

781
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,090
我以为你会失望的
I thought you'd be disappointed.

782
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,810
那是在我找到这个...
That was before I found this...

783
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,910
和这个...
and this...

784
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,470
还有这个之前
and this.

785
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,720
-天哪  -你说对了
- Holy shit. - You were right.

786
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,060
我一顺着正确方向  着手调查
As soon as I started looking in the right places,

787
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,910
好多信息就都扑面而来
all the apples started falling from the tree.

788
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,300
至少有二十名囚犯投诉
There's gotta be at least 20 complaints

789
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,070
未能在预定日期顺利出狱
of prisoners being denied their release date.

790
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,490
而且他们每个人都受伤了
And every one of them involves injuries

791
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,800
还被指有一些含混不清的违纪行为
and some kind of vague disciplinary action.

792
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,950
我的天  他们不仅仅在医疗服务上省了钱
Jesus. They're not just cheaping out on medical care.

793
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,960
甚至在创造收益
They're manufacturing revenue.

794
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,970
奥利佛  这...
Oliver, this...

795
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,660
这难以置信  你找到了集体诉讼
This is unbelievable. You got a class now.

796
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,650
不过有个问题
There's only one problem.

797
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,760
我没这么多资源来独自搞定
I don't have the resources to handle this alone.

798
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,410
奥利佛  我们说过这个的
Oliver, we've been over this.

799
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,250
我签过协议  答应不能插手
I signed an agreement that said I wouldn't touch it.

800
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,230
-我不能违约  -我的天  迈克
- I can't cross that line. - Jesus Christ, Mike.

801
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,690
你是在告诉我  对你来说
You're telling me you care more about some

802
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,000
你签的一张纸比那些人的生命还重要吗
piece of paper you signed than about these men's lives?

803
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,660
不  但我确实签了协议
No, I don't, but I signed it.

804
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,300
也就是说如果我插手此事  被他们发现
Which means if I get involved and they find out,

805
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,390
案子会被叫停  奥斯卡将一无所得
the case gets tossed, and Oscar gets nothing.

806
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,300
你过去做冒牌律师这么多年  现在却告诉我
You lived a lie for years. You're telling me

807
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,080
你连做一个小案子的秘密都藏不住吗
you can't keep a secret about working one Goddamn case?

808
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,240
我向哈维保证过
I gave Harvey my word.

809
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,760
那我该怎么做
So what the hell am I supposed to do?

810
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,950
你应该说服纳森
You're supposed to convince Nathan

811
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,780
给你更多资源完成此事
to give you the resources to pursue this.

812
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,710
如果我没做到  就得去告诉奥斯卡
And when I can't and I have to go back and tell Oscar

813
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,600
这案子无法继续...
that we can't move forward with this...

814
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,510
而那是你的责任
that's gonna be on you.

815
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,540
我知道怎么搞定布莱顿
I know how to take down Bratton.

816
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,870
亚历克斯  我们说过这个了
Alex, we've been over this.

817
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,850
我不会放弃你或你的客户
I am not giving up you or your clients.

818
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,450
我不是想说这个  我手上有他的把柄
I'm not talking about that. I got something on him.

819
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,460
为什么我第一次听说这个
Why is this the first I'm hearing about this?

820
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,670
你知道原因
You know why.

821
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,890
因为不管什么把柄
Because whatever it is,

822
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,450
都是你和他共同的把柄
he's got the same damn thing on you.

823
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,160
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

824
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,770
你早就该告诉我
You should have told me this before.

825
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,430
我不能  否则你绝不会雇我
I couldn't. You never would've hired me.

826
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,270
我是说  在他们开始找我们麻烦时
I meant when they started coming after us.

827
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,610
我还希望不会用上这个
I was hoping I wouldn't have to use it.

828
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,190
现在我用得上了  是什么把柄
Well, now I do. What is it?

829
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,970
-我不能告诉你  -你在开玩笑吗
- I can't tell you. - Are you kidding me?

830
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,920
只要我没告诉你  你就算不上同伙
As long as I don't tell you, you're not party to it.

831
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,600
我不能让你牵涉进来
I'm not gonna expose you like that.

832
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,050
我要独自处理此事
I'm gonna take care of this myself.

833
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,100
如果你想这么办
If you're gonna do that,

834
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,270
为什么还要来找我
then why are you even coming to me?

835
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,390
因为你把我带进律所  成为律所的一员
Because you took me in. I'm a part of this firm now,

836
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,550
如果我这样做  我不确定会发生什么事
and if I do this, I'm not sure what's gonna come of it.

837
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,280
这样可不够  你想过去解决此事
That's not good enough. You go over there and do this,

838
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,260
就最好给我保证能办好
you sure as hell better make it work.

839
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,820
好  我们明天就搞定
All right, good. We'll wrap this up tomorrow.

840
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,870
谢谢
Thanks.

841
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,730
我还在想  你什么时候会爬回来
I was wondering when you'd come crawling back.

842
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,540
我回来了  但是走回来的
I'm back, but I'm not crawling.

843
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,340
我来告诉你
I'm here to tell you

844
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,700
你在针对我的律所
you're backing the hell off my firm.

845
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,730
我知道你来干嘛  但让我问问你
I know what you're here to do, but let me ask you this.

846
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,490
你的律所知道你做过什么吗
Does your firm know what it is that you did?

847
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,820
不  但如果你抓着这事不放
No. But if you don't let this shit go,

848
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,980
我不会只告诉他们  也不会只说
they're not gonna be the only ones I tell.

849
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,830
自己做了什么  还会说你做了什么
And not just what I did. What you did.

850
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,980
我要是放手此事
I let this shit go,

851
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,250
肯定会被反咬一口
and it comes back and hits you in the ass.

852
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,490
你得签下协议
You're gonna sign something

853
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,470
声明我与此事无关
saying I had nothing to do with this.

854
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,490
我已经签好了
I already did.

855
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,050
我还给你准备了一份协议
Just like I also prepared something for you to sign

856
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,780
让你保证在未来十年  不会盯着
saying you won't so much as look at any of our clients

857
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,330
我们的任何客户
for the next ten years.

858
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,170
-你愿意这样做  -我说了
- You're willing to do this. - Like I said.

859
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,550
我已经签了
I already did it.

860
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,570
现在这都是你的担子了
It's on you now.

861
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,660
是的
Yes. It is.

862
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,650
搞定了吗
Is it done?

863
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,050
你觉得呢
What do you think?

864
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,720
我觉得你很可能到了那里
I think you probably went in there

865
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,690
大概会说  "你得撤诉
and said something like, "You're gonna drop these lawsuits

866
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,720
而且别想追着我们的客户不放
And you're gonna forget about coming after any of our clients."

867
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,070
然后他说  "你们的客户
And he said, "Our clients?

868
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,660
你的意思是我的客户吧"
Don't you mean my clients?"

869
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,290
然后我说  "不  混蛋
And I said, "No,

870
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,660
就是我们的客户"
motherfu--er, I don't.

871
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,600
因为我现在就职皮尔逊-斯佩克特律所
Because I'm at Pearson Specter now,

872
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,750
他不能抢我的客户
and he's not getting my clients.

873
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,290
你比他强太多了  亚历克斯
You're twice the man he is, Alex.

874
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,730
-什么意思  -我意思是  如果船在下沉
- What do you mean? - I mean if the ship were sinking,

875
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,330
汤米・布莱顿会把他最好的朋友
Tommy Bratton would throw his best friend

876
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,570
扔到水里  好让船撑到靠岸
overboard to get himself to shore.

877
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,780
而你  会给朋友一艘救生艇
You, on the other hand, would offer him a life raft.

878
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,120
谢谢  哈维
Thanks, Harvey.

879
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,620
不  亚历克斯  谢谢你才是
No, Alex. Thank you.

880
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,200
我们要怎么告诉路易和唐娜
What are we gonna tell Louis and Donna

881
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,840
这事如何解决的
about how this all went away?

882
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,980
就告诉他们  我们想尽了一切办法
We're gonna tell them we did whatever it took.

883
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,870
而且我郑重道歉  路易说对了
And for the record, Louis is right.

884
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,680
你现在和我们是一边的
You are one of us now.

885
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,740
别告诉路易  我承认他是对的
Don't tell Louis I said he was right.

886
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,550
别担心  反正你说的每三件事里
Don't worry about it. I only listen to

887
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,320
我只会听进去一件
every third thing you say anyway.

888
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,260
我才想起没问过你
I just realized I never

889
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,890
你在广场饭店的会面怎么样了
asked how the meeting at the Plaza went.

890
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,280
我取消了
I canceled it.

891
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,710
-我不懂  -我去晚了
- I don't understand. - I got there late,

892
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,700
然后那个女人还是开始让我做各种选择
and the woman started showing me options anyway.

893
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,970
但我意识到...
But I realized...

894
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,080
我更多时间是在想
I was spending more time thinking about

895
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,700
谁在向布莱顿透露内部信息
who was feeding Bratton Gould inside information

896
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,180
而不是在想
than I was about

897
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,060
婚礼的餐巾纸应该是什么颜色
what color our napkins were going to be.

898
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,850
所以你不想在广场饭店举行婚礼了吗
So you don't wanna have it at the Plaza anymore?

899
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,980
不  我不是想说这个
No, that's not it.

900
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,450
迈克  我们之间出了什么问题
Mike, what's wrong with us?

901
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,500
甚至连一个约会都抽不出时间
We can't even find the time to keep one appointment.

902
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,710
瑞秋  别这样  我们现在太多公事缠身
Rachel, come on, our schedules are crazy right now.

903
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,340
他对我说那些话前  我也是这么跟他说的
And that's exactly what I told my dad when he brought it up.

904
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,750
他说了什么
Brought what up?

905
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,970
他说  如果我们现在都没时间打理这些
He said that if we can't make time for each other right now,

906
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,180
哪有时间来打理婚姻
how are we gonna make time for our marriage?

907
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,620
你是我生命中最重要的人
You are the most important thing in my life.

908
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,050
如果你现在想放下一切
If you wanna drop everything right now

909
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,120
计划婚礼  蜜月
and plan the wedding and the honeymoon

910
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,880
开始选孩子的名字
and start picking out baby names,

911
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,380
那我们就这么做
then that's what we'll do.

912
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,450
问题就在这儿
That's the thing.

913
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,570
我不想放下一切
I don't wanna drop everything right now.

914
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,030
我想结婚
I wanna get married...

915
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,860
但我也很在乎我的工作
but I also really care about what I do.

916
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,860
也许你父亲是对的
Maybe your father's right.

917
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,410
-迈克  -不  我是说
- Mike-- - No, I mean that he's right

918
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,390
他说我们现在自己策划这些太困难
about how hard it is for us to throw ourselves

919
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,230
确实是对的  但是...
into our wedding right now, but...

920
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,300
但他认为我们永远没时间是错的
he's wrong if he thinks we never will.

921
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,110
-什么意思  -意思是
- What does that mean? - That means

922
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,060
我也在乎我的工作
that I care about what I do too.

923
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,550
现在我还得去解决一件
And right now I gotta go take care of something

924
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,760
我早该解决的事  但是...
that I should have taken care of before, but...

925
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,860
等我们回了家
when we get home,

926
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,270
我们开一瓶红酒
we're gonna crack open a bottle of wine,

927
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,600
我们彻夜长谈
and we're gonna talk all night

928
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,570
讨论我们想要什么样的婚礼
about the kind of wedding we wanna have.

929
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,300
然后我们选一个好日子
And then we are gonna pick a date.

930
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,550
真的吗
Really?

931
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,380
真的
Really.

932
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,230
哈维  我知道你来是...
Harvey, I know you're coming in here to--

933
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,160
唐娜  镇定  我来是告诉你
Donna, relax. I came over here to tell you

934
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,280
结束了
that it's over.

935
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,970
你回家好好休息吧
Why don't you go home and get some rest?

936
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,100
我知道你一直加班加点在办这件事
I know you've been working around the clock on this thing.

937
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,480
对不起  哈维
I'm sorry, Harvey.

938
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,040
-什么意思  -你给我升了职
- What do you mean? - You promoted me.

939
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,690
你相信了我
You had faith in me,

940
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,730
我却没查出来这个人  我让你失望了
and I never found out who it was--I let you down.

941
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,470
唐娜  十二年来你从未让我失望
Donna, you haven't let me down in 12 years,

942
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,070
现在也没有
and you didn't start now.

943
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,010
再说  不管是谁...
Besides, whoever it was...

944
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,780
现在都不重要了
doesn't matter anymore.

945
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,330
你好
Hello?

946
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,060
是你  对吗
It was you, wasn't it?

947
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,670
什么是我
What was me?

948
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,170
别糊弄我  杰西卡
Don't bullshit me, Jessica.

949
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,130
你给汤米・布莱顿去了电话
You called Tommy Bratton

950
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,970
告诉了他怎么坑我和路易
and gave him the roadmap to me and Louis,

951
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,400
我想知道原因
and I wanna know why.

952
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,900
如果你已经知道是我
If you figured that out,

953
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,350
-那你也知道原因了  -我要听你说
- then you already know why. - I want an answer.

954
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,090
你来找我帮忙  说你的王国要分崩离析
You came to me saying that your house was divided.

955
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,200
不管你愿不愿意承认  哈维
And whether you like hearing it or not, Harvey,

956
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,830
没什么比外界的攻击更能让内部团结
nothing unites a divided house like an attack from the outside.

957
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,800
这也不代表你就该去找他来攻击我们
That doesn't mean you pick up the phone and call him.

958
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,070
不是我找的他  是他联系的我
I didn't call him. He called me.

959
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,430
他本来就想攻击你们了  哈维
He was coming anyway, Harvey.

960
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,720
我只是告诉了他
All I did was mention that...

961
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,300
我不喜欢我离开时
I didn't like the way I was treated

962
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,830
你们对我的态度
on my way out the door,

963
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,190
如果他想整你
and if he wanted to get to you,

964
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,700
就该挑拨你和路易的关系
he should play you against Louis.

965
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,390
杰西卡  我找你寻求帮助
Jessica, I called you for advice,

966
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,960
不是让你在幕布后面
not so that you'd go behind the scenes

967
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,090
-把我们当木偶玩弄  -哈维
- and manipulate things. - Harvey.

968
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,930
-你说我已经准备好了  -你是准备好了
- You said I was ready. - You are.

969
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,650
而且现在大家也都知道了
And now they know you are,

970
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,880
下一次遇到危机他们就会支持你
and they're behind you for the next time.

971
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,370
-我想我该谢谢你  -不客气  哈维
- I guess I should thank you. - You're welcome, Harvey.

972
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,440
但如果你再干这种事
But you pull something like this again...

973
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,530
我也不需要再这样
I won't have to.

974
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,720
晚安  杰西卡
Good night, Jessica.

975
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,810
晚安  哈维
Good night, Harvey.

976
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,600
-瞧瞧谁来电话了  -你在干什么
- Well, look who it is. - What are you doing?

977
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,560
为明天的庭审做准备
Just getting ready for trial tomorrow.

978
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,890
停不下来的  对吧
It never stops, does it?

979
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,900
-什么  -律师的工作
- What's that? - The work of being a lawyer.

980
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,530
但这也不代表你就腾不出时间
Doesn't mean you can't make time for...

981
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,500
干更重要的事
the more important things. 

982
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,520
说起更重要的事
Speaking of the more important things--

983
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,020
我和时代广场的婚礼策划师预约了时间
I set a meeting with the planner at the Plaza.

984
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,470
婚礼一定会很完美
It's gonna be wonderful.

985
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,340
谢谢
Thank you.

986
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,510
你不需要感谢我  瑞秋
Aw, you don't have to thank me, Rachel.

987
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,580
我只希望你能得到你想要的婚礼
All I want is for your wedding to be exactly what you want.

988
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,440
而我想要休息一段时间
And what I want is gonna take some time,

989
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,980
因为爸爸  你是对的
because, Dad, you were right.

990
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,430
我想  享受其中
I want to...enjoy it

991
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,750
为它腾出时间
and make time for it.

992
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,700
所以迈克和我会定下婚期
So Mike and I are gonna set a date,

993
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,850
但不是最近
but it's not gonna be for a while.

994
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,810
在什么时候不重要
Well, it doesn't matter when it is.

995
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,190
只要你开心
As long as you're happy.

996
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,080
很好  因为我还有件事跟你说
Good. Because there's something else I wanted to say.

997
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,110
我听说你和我们之间的虚假合并的
I heard this idea of a fake merger

998
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,610
-计划取消了  -让我猜猜
- between us was floated. - Let me guess.

999
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,700
你觉得我应该帮助哈维
You think I should have helped Harvey out.

1000
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,880
不是  我是想说虽然是假的
No. What I was gonna say was even though it was fake,

1001
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,820
但我还是为能和父亲一起工作激动了一下
I got kind of excited about the thought of working with my dad.

1002
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,940
我从来没想到能听到你说这句话
I never thought I'd ever hear you say that.

1003
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,170
卡特里娜跟我说你曾经说了
Well, Katrina told me that you said something once

1004
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,620
我以为你绝对不会说的话
that I was afraid I'd never hear, and...

1005
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,690
它对我意义重大
It meant everything to me.

1006
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,220
什么话
And what's that?

1007
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,100
你说觉得我是个很棒的律师
That you think I'm a great lawyer.

1008
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,460
而且你为我骄傲
And that you're proud of me.

1009
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,860
瑞秋
Rachel...

1010
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,170
也许我是不常说出来
I may not say it often enough.

1011
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,720
但我从来都是这么想的
But I think it all the time.

1012
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,280
我爱你  爸爸
I love you, Dad.

1013
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,980
我也爱你  宝贝
I love you too, baby.

1014
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,570
-你好  -奥利佛  是我
- Hello. - Oliver, it's me.

1015
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,530
抱歉  迈克  我现在没时间
Sorry, Mike, I can't talk right now.

1016
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,390
我正为一个解决不了的案子忙呢
I'm kinda busy being overwhelmed by a case I can't handle.

1017
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,160
看来你没有说服内森
I take it you couldn't convince Nathan

1018
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,550
-给你更多人手  -是的
