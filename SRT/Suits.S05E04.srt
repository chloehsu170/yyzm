{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,330
你没经过我的允许就接了这个案子
You took this case without running it by me.

16
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,300
-杰西卡  -够了  撤销
- Jessica-- - That's enough. Dump it.

17
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,200
否则我去撤销
Or I will.

18
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,520
你觉得这案子能赢吗
You think this case is a winner?

19
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,380
能赢
I do.

20
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,780
那你觉得我们一起做如何
Then what do you say we do it together?

21
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,570
我怕你们最终会憎恨对方
I'm afraid you're gonna end up hating each other.

22
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,080
如果我足够幸运的话将会因为很多事情和他争斗
If I'm lucky, I'm gonna fight with him about a lot of things.

23
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,480
所以为什么不以一次站在同一边的斗争作为开始呢
Why not start with a fight where we're both on the same side?

24
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,530
这是哈维最近三个案子的收益表
This is harvey's last three income statements,

25
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,280
我发现它们被放在复印机里
and I found them sitting in the copy machine.

26
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,720
是你主动为我工作的
You came to work for me.

27
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,150
你做决定的时候知道我是什么样的人
You knew who I was when you did,

28
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,480
你该作出决定了
so now it's time for you to decide.

29
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,570
你到底要不要站在我这边
Are you with me or not?

30
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,510
因为你总说  "人一旦选择了立场
You always said, once you pick a side,

31
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,020
就要忠于他的立场
if you're not loyal to that side,

32
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,030
不然他算什么人呢"
then who the hell are you?

33
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,610
那你在选择一个会做出这种事的人之前
You should've thought of that before you picked someone

34
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,690
就该好好想想
who would do something like this in the first place.

35
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,550
你再跟杰克・索罗夫一伙儿
You ever take sides with Jack Soloff against me again,

36
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,980
我会灭了你
I will bury you.

37
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,130
你看起来很开心啊
Well, you look happy.

38
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,140
是贝琪刚告诉苏西她确实很喜欢你吗
Becky just tell Susie she like-likes you?

39
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,500
其实是凯尔顿保险刚告诉罗伯特・赞恩
Eh, more like Kelton insurance just told Robert Zane

40
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,160
他们确实很害怕我们
they're scared-scared of us.

41
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,140
你们收到和解报价了
You got a settlement offer?

42
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,530
就像他说的那样
Just like he said we would.

43
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,870
不得不表扬他一下  他把他们耍得很漂亮
I got to hand it to him, he played them perfectly.

44
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,790
是吗
Did he now?

45
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,510
什么
What?

46
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,510
没事
Nothing.

47
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,240
听着  我收回关于贝琪的话
Look, I take it back about Becky.

48
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,060
这里唯一春心萌动的人是你
The only one with a crush around here is you.

49
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,680
看来有些人担心罗伯特・赞恩
Sounds like someone's worried that Robert Zane

50
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,940
也许会比他强
might be better than him.

51
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,980
想得美  泰格  但魔术师什么时候怕过伯德
Nice try, Tiger, but did Magic ever worry about Bird?

52
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,210
首先  是的  他怕过
First of all, yes, he did.

53
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,080
其次  你有没有意识到
Second of all, you realize

54
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,500
在这个比喻里你才是白人
you're the white guy in this scenario, right?

55
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,430
我知道在任何比喻里我都是比较厉害的那个
I know I'm the bigger badass in every scenario.

56
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,570
好吧厉害先生  你是谁  魔术师还是伯德
Okay, Mr. Badass, which one are you, Magic or Bird?

57
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,780
我觉得我们都很清楚我是
I think we both know I'm...

58
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,740
乔丹
Jordan.

59
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,440
不如你去找你的男友罗伯特・赞恩吧
Hey, why don't you go meet your boyfriend Robert Zane?

60
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,460
我好像落了东西在保安那里
I think I just left something at security.

61
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,920
看看现在是谁喜欢某人了
Oh. Look who like-likes someone now.

62
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,150
女士  上次我放了
Ma'am, the last time I let someone up

63
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,700
没有预约的人上去
that he wasn't expecting,

64
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,720
他威胁要把我处决
he threatened to have me executed.

65
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,410
我知道他肯定是那样说的  但我跟你说
I'm sure he did, but I'm telling you that--

66
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,850
格蕾琴肯定是忘了打电话下来了  卡尔
That Gretchen obviously forgot to phone down, Carl,

67
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,460
因为我们约了就这个时间开会
because we have a meeting scheduled for right now.

68
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,690
但她刚才不是这么...
That isn't what she just--

69
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,530
卡尔
Carl.

70
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,340
和你开会  真的吗
A meeting with you. Really?

71
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,830
我敢向你保证我比
I promise I'm much better-looking

72
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,600
你要见的那个人帅
than whoever you were supposed to meet.

73
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,190
你说的太对了
You have no idea how right you are.

74
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,210
但我看你好像正要出去
But I could have sworn you were just on your way out.

75
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,560
没关系的
Oh, that's not a problem.

76
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,650
市长可以等
The mayor can wait.

77
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,560
但我觉得州长不一定可以
But I'm not sure the Governor can.

78
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,180
你是在跟我比名头吗
Are you trying to out-name-drop me?

79
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,110
如果是的话  我觉得我刚赢了
If I were, I think I just did.

80
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,120
但我告诉你个小秘密
But I'll let you in on a little secret.

81
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,900
我一点都不在乎名头
I don't really care about names that much.

82
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,820
如果你不在意名头
Well, if you don't care about names,

83
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,330
那我们就跳过自我介绍阶段
why don't we skip the introductions

84
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,840
直接吃早餐吧
and just get down to breakfast?

85
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,260
如果我已经吃过了呢
What if I already had breakfast?

86
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,060
我是说明早  在我的厨房
I'm talking about tomorrow morning, in my kitchen.

87
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,430
或者你的  我是说  你看起来有个好住处
Or yours, I mean, you look like you have a nice place.

88
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,210
虽然很有诱惑力  但下次吧
As tempting as that is, maybe another time.

89
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,940
祝你开会顺利
Good luck in your meeting.

90
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,810
我最喜欢的讨人厌律师最近好吗
So how's my favorite pain-in-the-ass lawyer?

91
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,530
我以为路易是你最喜欢的讨人厌律师
I thought Louis was your favorite pain-in-the-ass lawyer.

92
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,570
没错  但我做这个
He is, but Louis isn't responsible

93
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,610
可不是为了路易
for me getting to work on this.

94
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,250
你在给我们的案子干粗活儿
You're doing the grunt work on our case?

95
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,140
我托了关系揽下这活儿  觉得这可以
I pulled some strings, thought it might give us

96
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,500
让我们有机会一起工作
a chance to work together.

97
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,120
你知道我已经订婚了  是吧
You know I'm engaged, right?

98
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,880
是的  迈克  这是我的计划
Yes, Mike, that's my plan,

99
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,870
把你从我老板女儿的身边偷走
to steal you from my boss's daughter.

100
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,440
事实如此  木已成舟
It's a thing. It's been done.

101
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,050
我不是来偷走你的心的
Well, I didn't come here to steal you.

102
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,930
我是来感谢你的
I came here to thank you.

103
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,840
为什么
For what?

104
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,890
拜托  迈克
Come on, Mike.

105
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,990
我被解雇了  而两天后
I get fired, and two days later,

106
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,770
瑞秋的父亲给我提供了职位
I get an offer from Rachel's father?

107
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,580
不论你是怎么做到的  我都欠你一个人情
Whatever you did, I owe you one.

108
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,720
事实上  你欠瑞秋的人情
Actually, you owe Rachel one.

109
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,770
不是吧
No shit.

110
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,610
就是
Shit.

111
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,360
该死
shiiit.

112
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,400
顺便说  你进错会议室了
By the way, you're in the wrong conference room.

113
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,620
好吧  埃斯特  你来这干什么
Okay, Esther, what are you doing here?

114
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,830
怎么  一个女人  不能在路过时
What, a woman can't stop by

115
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,510
顺便来看看她爱的哥哥吗
to see her brother, who she loves?

116
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,770
拜托  你太清楚了  我们之间没爱
Please, you know damn well we don't love each other.

117
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,980
这么说的话  我要请律师
In that case, I need a lawyer.

118
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,660
你  要律师干嘛
You? For what?

119
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,530
你卖的松饼让人感染沙门氏菌了吗
Did you give someone salmonella with your stupid muffins?

120
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,450
我要离婚
I'm getting a divorce.

121
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,040
好吧
Well, good.

122
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,640
我第一次见他就觉得他是个累赘
I knew that guy was dead weight the second I met him.

123
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,190
我知道  你在婚礼致辞的时候就这么说的
I know, I think that was your speech at our wedding.

124
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,970
你的同情很感人
And your sympathy is touching,

125
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,480
但我不是跑来证明你有多正确的
but I didn't come here to vindicate you.

126
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,730
我知道
No, I know you didn't.

127
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,040
你是来让我
You came to get me

128
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,120
帮你干掉杰弗里的  我会的
to slaughter Jeffrey for you, and I will.

129
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,550
等我收拾完  他想拉屎都没有夜壶用
When I'm done with him, he won't have a pot to shit in.

130
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,860
夜壶是用来尿的
It's "Piss in".

131
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,090
路易  我不想让你干掉杰弗里
And, Louis, I don't want you to slaughter Jeffrey.

132
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,060
为什么
Why the hell not?

133
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,730
因为我想让哈维・斯佩克特来做
Because I want Harvey Specter to.

134
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,440
再说一遍
Come again?

135
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,470
你说过  他是城里最好的律师
You said he was the best attorney in the city.

136
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,290
不  埃斯特  我说的是他是我最好的朋友
No, Esther, I told you he was my best friend.

137
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,750
十年级的时候
Which is exactly what you said

138
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,430
你也是这么说杰里米・翰舍的
about Jeremy Henschell in tenth grade,

139
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,640
而这句话真正的意思是
which really meant

140
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,560
你远远地崇拜着他
you worshipped him from afar,

141
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
写的日记都是关于他的
you wrote in your diary about him,

142
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,270
而且你俩都没一起玩过
and you never actually hung out.

143
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,050
你发誓说没过看我的日记
Okay, you swore you never read my diary.

144
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,230
你也发誓说没偷窥我和杰里米
And you swore you didn't spy on me and Jeremy.

145
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,370
拜托  就那么一次
Oh, please, that was one time.

146
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,890
我是要去拿杯牛奶
I was on my way to get a glass of milk.

147
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,750
而且你可能不知道
And for your information,

148
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,340
从那以后  我一直乳糖过敏
I've been lactose intolerant ever since.

149
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,760
路易  是你帮我找哈维
Louis, are you gonna get me Harvey,

150
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,380
还是我自己去找
or do I have to get him myself?

151
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,580
哈维现在不接新客户
Harvey is not taking on any new clients right now,

152
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,230
而且未来几年都不在城里
and he's out of town for the next few years.

153
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,700
路易  我知道你什么意思
Louis, I know what you're doing.

154
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,620
你以为我找哈维
You think I want Harvey

155
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,730
是因为我觉得你不够好
because I don't think you're good enough.

156
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,950
你错了
You're wrong.

157
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,670
我知道你有多出色
I know how good you are.

158
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,490
但这是我的私事
But this is personal for me,

159
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,790
那就意味着  那也是你的私事
which means it will be personal for you,

160
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,570
我不能让你参与
and I can't have that.

161
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,010
所以拜托  帮我去找哈维好吗
So please, will you get me Harvey?

162
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,350
我帮你找哈维
I'll make it happen.

163
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,030
谢谢  路易
Thank you, Louis.

164
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,050
刚才那是埃斯特
That was Esther?

165
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,870
对  我知道你要说什么
Yes, I know what you're gonna say--

166
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,850
我们是一个模子刻出来的
we look exactly alike.

167
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,810
我没想说...
That actually wasn't...

168
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,070
我知道  我要是带上假发就是那样
I get it--it's like looking at me in a wig.

169
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,240
我已经听过上千遍了
I've heard it a thousand times.

170
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,030
对  你们相像得不可思议
Yeah, the resemblance is uncanny.

171
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,730
怎么了
What?

172
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,880
我只是好奇你干嘛不赶快起身去找哈维
I'm just wondering why you're not getting up to go ask Harvey.

173
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,180
因为我不打算去找他帮忙
Because I'm not gonna ask him.

174
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,440
我打算省点时间直接告诉她哈维拒绝了
I'm gonna save some time and tell her he said no.

175
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,750
-路易...  -唐娜
- Louis-- - Donna,

176
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,380
我们都清楚哈维超级生我的气
we all know that Harvey's furious at me.

177
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,890
他没可能会答应帮忙的
There's no way he's gonna do it.

178
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,830
也许是这样
Maybe not.

179
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,910
但是  路易  她是你家人
But, Louis, she's family,

180
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,210
要说有什么是哈维能理解的
and if there's one thing that Harvey understands,

181
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,150
那就是这个了
it's that.

182
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,040
你去哪里了
Where the hell have you been?

183
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,190
抱歉  路上堵死了
Sorry, I got stuck in really bad traffic.

184
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,150
你刚刚进错会议室了
So you were in the wrong conference room.

185
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,960
耽搁了差不多20分钟
For about 20 minutes.

186
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,700
和解金有多少
So what did we get?

187
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,850
想要猜猜看吗
Want to take a guess?

188
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,630
九千万
$90 million.

189
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,140
你还想认真猜猜吗
Want to take a real guess?

190
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,020
刚刚就是认真的啊
That was a real guess.

191
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,550
小子  你是哪个外星球来的
Son, what planet are you living on?

192
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,450
就是那个你管它叫
The planet where you called

193
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,100
"我们得到了很棒的和解协议"的星球
To say we got a great settlement.

194
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,900
两千五百万就是很棒的和解了
$25 million is a great settlement.

195
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,420
两千五百万
$25 million?

196
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,410
罗伯特  结完各种费用
Robert, after fees,

197
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,600
每个人连七万都拿不到
that's less than $70,000 per person.

198
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,390
那你觉得我们要如何回应
Then what do you suggest we counter with?

199
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,180
我建议上庭吧
I suggest we counter with a trial.

200
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,630
你疯了吗  不能上庭
Are you nuts? You don't go to trial.

201
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,500
只能给他们施压  然后和解
You turn up the pressure, and then you settle.

202
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,830
上庭就是施压啊
Going to trial is turning up the pressure.

203
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,470
我们一讲完开庭陈词
The second we finish opening arguments,

204
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,060
钱就会翻三倍了
that offer is gonna triple.

205
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,700
听着  过去六年来  我和这两个人
Look, I've sat across the table from these two

206
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,150
谈判过四次
four times in the last six years,

207
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,620
他们说这是能给的最高价时
and when they say this is their best offer,

208
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,490
那就是这样了
It's their best offer,

209
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,570
我们就要建议受害者接受
and we're recommending it.

210
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,000
随你怎么建议
Well, you can recommend whatever you want.

211
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,290
反正我是要建议他们拒绝的
I'm recommending we reject it.

212
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,240
不能给客户相互矛盾的建议
You don't give clients conflicting opinions.

213
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,620
我俩关起门来统一意见
You work it out behind closed doors.

214
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,650
也许那就是问题所在
Well, maybe that's the problem.

215
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,300
你想要关起门来做事
You want to do things behind closed doors.

216
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,530
而我却想做到诚信公开
I actually want to be honest.

217
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,410
注意你的态度  迈克
Hey, watch yourself, Mike.

218
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:27,990
你自己说
You tell me this,

219
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,190
假如事关劳拉或者瑞秋的性命
would $70,000 per person

220
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,860
你还会觉得每人七万
be a great settlement if we were talking

221
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,570
是很好的和解协议吗
about Laura's life or Rachel's?

222
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,580
你给我滚
You get out of here!

223
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,700
在你想清楚为什么
You don't come back

224
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,070
要建议受害者接受和解前别回来
until you wrap your head around recommending this offer.

225
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,230
还有  不许再用她们俩来反驳我
And don't you ever use them against me again!

226
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,490
别告诉我他也不在这里
Don't tell me he wasn't in here either.

227
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,040
之前在的
He was in here, all right.

228
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,460
怎么了  和解失败了吗
What happened? Did the settlement fall through?

229
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,090
没失败  但应该让它失败的
No, it didn't, but it should've.

230
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,830
他们给的和解金额很少
They gave us a shitty offer.

231
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,210
而罗伯特准备接受
Robert's ready to take it.

232
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,930
拜托  假如真有那么糟糕
Come on, if it's really that bad,

233
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:37,880
他怎么会接受
why would he take it?

234
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,890
因为他知道他的客户们会大发雷霆
Because he knows his clients will jump all over it

235
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,620
而这是简单的解决办法
and it's the easy way out.

236
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,880
所以你觉得罗伯特不关心他的客户吗
So you think Robert doesn't care about his clients?

237
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,910
看起来确实是这样的
It sure seems that way.

238
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,050
迈克  我来这里只有几个月
Mike, I've only been here a few months,

239
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,790
但关于罗伯特・赞恩你可以有种种说法
and there are a lot of things you can say about Robert Zane,

240
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,970
但你唯独不能说
but what you can't say is that

241
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,160
他不关心自己的客户
he doesn't care about his clients.

242
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,230
走开  路易
Go away, Louis.

243
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,440
我本来要走的  但那样我就无法告诉你
I would, but then I couldn't tell you

244
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,500
我要把那五千万的公司给你了
about the $50-million company I'm giving you.

245
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,740
你为什么要那么做
And why would you do that?

246
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,630
因为我想要弥补我俩之间小小的误会
'Cause I want to make up for our little misunderstanding.

247
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,920
我们之间没什么误会
We didn't have a misunderstanding.

248
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,210
你以前是抢我的钱
You went after my money,

249
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,660
所以假如你主动给我客户
so if you're giving me a client,

250
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,020
那就说明还有其他的误会
there's some other misunderstanding

251
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,210
但是你太懦弱而不敢告诉我
that you're too chickenshit to tell me about.

252
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,100
是我妹妹的公司
It's my sister's company.

253
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,840
我会把她这个客户给你
I'll give you her business.

254
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,690
而你只需解决她的离婚案
All you have to do is handle her divorce.

255
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,280
我不想要你妹妹这个客户
I don't want your sister's business.

256
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,400
给我出去
Now get out.

257
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,180
哈维  她是我的家人
Harvey, this is my family.

258
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,000
我妹妹  她从没求过我任何事
My sister, she...has never asked me for anything

259
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,700
一次都没
Her entire life, not once.

260
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,590
这是第一次  我不能让她失望
Now the one time she does, I just can't let her down.

261
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,430
路易  我不是离婚律师
Louis, I'm not a divorce attorney.

262
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,180
你什么时候在意过这种无关紧要的细节了
When has a shitty detail like that ever stopped you before?

263
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,680
好吧  但我有两个条件
All right, I'll do it, on two conditions.

264
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,070
第一  你绝对不许插手
First, you stay completely out of this case.

265
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,470
没问题  第二呢
Done. Second?

266
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,180
我想好了再告诉你
I'll let you know when I think of it.

267
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,970
我怎么确定你不会提什么不能忍的要求呢
How do I know it won't be something I can't stomach?

268
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,870
不能确定  这就是条件
You don't, but those are my two conditions.

269
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,090
好吧  哈维  成交
Okay, Harvey, you have a deal.

270
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,860
就一点
One thing.

271
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,900
答应我你不会跟埃斯特睡了
Promise me you won't sleep with Esther.

272
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,160
相信我  路易  我最不想做的事
Believe me, Louis, the last thing I want to do

273
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,990
就是和你妹妹睡
is sleep with your sister.

274
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,320
你同意就好
I'm glad you agree.

275
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,740
等材料都弄好了我再联系你
I'll let you know when the paperwork's finished.

276
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,680
我知道你还没有
I know you didn't wrap your head

277
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,730
对那份协议回心转意
around this deal in the last ten minutes,

278
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,590
所以你现在来我办公室做什么
So what are you still doing in my office?

279
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,540
你要是我你也会做的事
Exactly what you'd be doing in my place.

280
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,170
罗伯特  你说你认识那两个律师
Robert, I know you said that you know these two lawyers,

281
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,070
但我不认识
but I don't.

282
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,030
我需要亲眼看到他们的底线
I need to see for myself what they will or won't do.

283
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,340
你还想还价
And you still want to counter.

284
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,630
至少要试一试
I want to at least try.

285
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,340
但你不想一个人试
Except you don't want to go by yourself,

286
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,250
你希望我和你一起
You want me to go with you.

287
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,100
是的
Yes, I do.

288
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,160
因为你我都清楚  如果我们不一起去
Because you and I both know, if we don't go together,

289
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,330
根本就没有机会赢
we don't stand a chance.

290
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,480
我们怎样都没有机会赢
I know we don't stand a chance either way.

291
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,680
我去了也只是让自己出丑罢了
And if I do go, it makes me look like a fool.

292
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,660
罗伯特  在法院时是我让你免于出丑
Robert, I saved you from looking like a fool in that courtroom.

293
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,740
我帮了你一把
I came through for you.

294
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,230
现在请你也为我做同样的事
Now I'm asking you to come through for me on this.

295
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,460
你和瑞秋真是如出一辙
You and Rachel are peas in a pod.

296
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,700
难以置信她的公司竟然真的值五千万
Can't believe she's really worth $50 million.

297
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,820
真不敢相信你从没听说过她的公司
I can't believe you've never heard of her company.

298
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,280
我看上去像会买很多隔热垫的人吗
Do I look like I buy a lot of potholders?

299
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,630
她又不是只卖隔热垫
She doesn't just sell potholders.

300
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,680
她的品牌和玛莎・斯图尔特的一样有名
She has a brand like Martha Stewart.

301
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,680
{\an8}著名家政公司创始人

302
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
我知道你觉得她很了不起
Look, I get that you think she's impressive,

303
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,050
但对我来说  她只是路易的妹妹
but to me, she's just Louis's sister,

304
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,580
光是这点  就是第二大噩耗
which, as far as I'm concerned, is strike number two.

305
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,620
第一大是什么
What's strike number one?

306
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,210
她是路易的妹妹这个事实
The fact that she's Louis's sister.

307
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,110
拜托  哈维  听着
Oh, come on, Harvey, listen.

308
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,580
你能不能认真对待这件事
Are you gonna take this seriously or not?

309
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,660
我来告诉你我的计划
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

310
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,450
我走进去
I'm gonna go walk there.

311
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,130
握握那女人的肥手
I'm gonna shake this woman's meaty hand.

312
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,680
然后把案子早解决早了事
I'm gonna get this over with as quickly as possible.

313
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,310
是你
You?

314
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,970
这不是在逗我吧
You've got to be kidding me.

315
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,080
你们认识
You two know each other?

316
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,970
所以你不是来和州长见面的
So you weren't meeting the governor.

317
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,280
你还要坚持说自己放了市长鸽子吗
You're telling me you were really gonna blow off the mayor?

318
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,100
市长  你根本不认识市长
The mayor. You don't know the mayor.

319
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,680
很抱歉
I'm so sorry,

320
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,790
这位是很快要被我炒鱿鱼的助理律师
let me introduce my soon-to-be former associate.

321
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,910
瑞秋・赞恩
Rachel Zane.

322
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,370
埃斯特・艾丁斯坦
Esther Edelstein.

323
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,320
终于有幸一见
It's nice to finally meet the man

324
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,920
我久仰大名的男人
I've heard such good things about.

325
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,800
终于有幸一见
It's nice to meet the woman

326
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,040
我除了讹传什么也没听说过的女人了
I've obviously heard nothing but lies about.

327
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,590
讲正题吧
Let's get to it.

328
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,160
好
Yes.

329
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,670
我必须得问
I just have to know,

330
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,840
你们有一个是被领养的吗
were one of the two of you adopted?

331
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,860
这么多年来我都被问习惯了
I've been asking that for years.

332
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,170
出去
Hey. Get out.

333
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,500
靠
Shit.

334
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,410
大点声  自恋狂  会议室又不是图书馆
Come on, speak up, narcissist, it's not a freakin' library.

335
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,160
提醒我把会议室的墙
Reminder to thin the walls

336
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,490
改薄或是开个洞
in the conference room/ make a peephole.

337
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,400
你干什么呢
What do you think you're doing?

338
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,210
什么事
What happened?

339
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,810
我只是在检查隔音效果
Oh, I was just checking the sound-proofing,

340
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,760
确保他们把会议室的墙加厚了
making sure they thicken the walls in the conference room.

341
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,640
所以我出门右转的话
So if I walk out this door and I turn to the right,

342
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,480
不会看见哈维和埃斯特在会议室里吗
I won't see Harvey in there with Esther?

343
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,940
埃斯特来了  我都不知道
Esther's here? I didn't know that.

344
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,470
路易  隔墙偷听
Louis, listening through the wall

345
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,880
可不叫不插手她的案子
is not staying out of her case,

346
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,710
如果被哈维发现了  他会放弃她的案子的
and if Harvey finds out, he's gonna drop her.

347
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,150
那可是我妹妹
Look, it's my sister, all right?

348
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,900
我只想确保他不含私心地对待她
I just want to make sure he does right by her.

349
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,780
如果你不相信他的人品的话
And you never would have asked him to take this case

350
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,150
你就不会请他接这个案子了
if you didn't trust that he would do just that.

351
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,120
所以  把杯子放下  回你办公室去
So put the glass down, go back to your office,

352
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,690
让他做他的工作就好
and let him do his job.

353
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,580
你要是时不时出点错
You know it'd be easier for both of us

354
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,280
我俩都能好过点
if you were wrong every once in a while.

355
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,400
我们决定离婚时  我和杰弗里达成共识
When we decided to get divorced, Jeffrey and I agreed

356
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,210
他会得到20%的公司股份  不用请律师
he would get 20% of the company, no need to involve lawyers.

357
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,500
接下来  我却收到一封律师函
The next thing I knew, I got a letter from a lawyer.

358
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,960
杰弗里觉得20%不够了
Jeffrey doesn't think 20% is enough anymore.

359
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,360
没错
No, he doesn't.

360
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,910
埃斯特  我要问你个问题
Esther, I'm gonna ask you a question,

361
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,730
希望你诚实地回答我
and I want you to answer me honestly.

362
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,110
是谁要离开谁
Who's leaving who?

363
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,620
我们都想离
It's mutual.

364
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,960
从没有双方都想离的
It's never mutual.

365
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,230
所以我再问一遍  是谁主动要离婚的
So I'm gonna ask you again. Who's driving this decision?

366
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,920
我
I am.

367
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,270
那我们解决问题的方法
Then the answer to our problem

368
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,410
就是让你不参与谈判
is for you to stay away from the negotiations.

369
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,650
什么  不行  我得参与
What? No, I'm not staying away.

370
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,520
听我说
Listen to me.

371
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,560
他背弃你们的协议
He's going back on your deal

372
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,160
是因为他想拖长这场战斗
because he wants to prolong the fight.

373
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,820
我不在乎
I don't care.

374
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,810
我花了12年建立起公司
I spent 12 years building the company.

375
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,810
我不会袖手旁观  让别人替我决定
I'm not gonna sit back and let someone else decide

376
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,270
能给我剩下多少
how much I'm allowed to keep.

377
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,560
那你还来找我干什么
Then what'd you come to me for?

378
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,310
因为你是最好的律师
Because you're supposed to be the best.

379
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,300
我是最好的  但我的风格
I am the best, and I didn't get that way

380
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,070
可不是让别人做决定
letting someone else call the shots.

381
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,790
所以你要么让我全权接手
So you're either gonna let me do that,

382
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,580
要么就换个律师吧
or you're gonna get yourself another lawyer.

383
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,820
我需要你做这些事
All right, here's what I need you to do.

384
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,470
你可以一分钟后再告诉我要干什么
You can tell me what you need me to do in a minute.

385
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,300
首先我们讨论刚刚发生的事
First we're gonna talk about what happened back there.

386
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,320
刚刚发生的是  我亮明规矩
What happened is, I laid down the law,

387
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,160
她接受了  我是大哥
she accepted, I'm the man.

388
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,210
是啊
Yep, uh-huh.

389
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,790
但我要说的不是那个
Okay, I'm not talking about that.

390
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,670
我想说的是你进门那一瞬间
I'm talking about how the moment you walked through the door,

391
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,310
就像被闪电劈了一样
you looked like you were struck by a bolt of lighting.

392
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,820
-我才没有  -绝对有
- I did not. - You most certainly did.

393
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,770
其实在你开始正事之前
In fact, before you started fighting,

394
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,750
我都担心你俩会在桌上来一炮
I was afraid the two of you were gonna go at it on the table.

395
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,690
担心还是希望
Afraid or hoping?

396
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,590
真恶心
That's unsavory.

397
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,000
对我们的客户发表下流评论就不恶心吗
And you making lewd comments about our client isn't?

398
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,960
哪个客户的下流评论
Lewd comments about what client?

399
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,470
哈维喜欢路易的妹妹
Harvey likes Louis's sister.

400
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,850
巧了  我来找他就是为了
That's funny, 'cause that's exactly what I came in here

401
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,000
谈这件事
to talk to him about.

402
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,670
你也喜欢路易的妹妹
You like Louis's sister?

403
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,760
还没喜欢到跟你争
Not enough to fight you for her.

404
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,880
你该重新考虑一下  她很可爱
Well, you should reconsider. She's lovely.

405
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,940
我先走了
And I'm leaving.

406
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,870
哈维  为什么突然之间
Harvey, why are you all of a sudden

407
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,840
埃斯特・艾丁斯坦成了你的客户
taking on Esther Edelstein as a client?

408
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,360
你可别告诉我因为她可爱
And don't tell me it's because she's lovely,

409
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,940
我可不相信
because I'm not sure I believe that.

410
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,040
路易求我  我才接了她的案子
I took her on because Louis asked me to.

411
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,710
可是上次我还听说  我们都在生他的气呢
And the last I heard, you and I were both pissed at him.

412
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,980
我的气没消啊
And I still am.

413
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,010
但他告诉我这是他的家人
But he told me this was family,

414
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,690
而且  我觉得这也是个机会
and...I thought this might be a chance

415
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,420
让我们重回正轨
for us all to get back on track.

416
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,400
干得不错  哈维
I like that, Harvey.

417
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,520
最后发现
You just might turn out

418
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,700
你还算是半个合格的冠名合伙人啊
to be a half decent name partner after all.

419
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,090
我深表怀疑
I doubt it.

420
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,170
我也不确定
So do I.

421
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,450
坦白说  罗伯特  我很惊讶
Well, frankly, Robert, I'm surprised

422
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,810
你竟然又要开会
you called for another meeting.

423
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,430
被例行还价吓到了吗
Surprised by a routine counter?

424
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,790
确实  尤其是我们的第一个提议那么大方
When the first offer is as generous as ours, I am.

425
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,200
听他把话说完  威尔
Just hear the man out, Will.

426
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,820
坎贝尔诉国家健康公司案  
Campbell v. State health.

427
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,520
威尔逊诉健力医疗案
Wilson v. GenRx.

428
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,750
弗莱德曼诉领先医疗公司案
Friedman v. Medfirst.

429
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,060
这些集体诉讼案都差不多
Those are identical class actions

430
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,970
它们的赔偿金额是
in which the average payout

431
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,750
平均每位原告50万
was $1/2 million per plaintiff.

432
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,110
这是法庭裁决的结果  其中还有两个因为
They were jury awards, and two of them were reduced

433
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,530
过度惩罚而降低了金额
for being excessively punitive.

434
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,760
那最后的金额也比你们给的高
Dollar amount was still higher than what's on the table.

435
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,120
可人家打了7年的官司呢
After seven years of appeals.

436
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,290
没错  可是我们也说了  不在乎时间
Yeah, and like we said, we don't care how long it takes.

437
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,170
我们希望你们现在给的金额能再翻三倍
We want triple what you're offering.

438
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,600
我还想跟索菲娅・维加拉一起裸泳呢
And I want to skinny dip with Sofia Vergara,

439
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,460
但是  臣妾做不到啊
But no puedo hacerlo.

440
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,980
这句西班牙语是说"我们连一分钱都不会再多给"
That's Spanish for "We're not giving you another nickel."

441
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,290
那西班牙语的"法庭见"怎么说
And what's Spanish for "We'll see you in court"?

442
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,840
放马过来
Bring it on.

443
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,140
好了  威尔  别动气
That's enough. Come on, Will.

444
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,390
我们这不还在谈嘛
We're just having a conversation.

445
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,510
谈
Conversation?

446
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,430
罗伯特  我给了你一个很好的提议
I gave you a fair offer, Robert,

447
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,890
因为我尊重你
because I respect you,

448
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,910
我觉得你也是尊重我的  所以当我说这是
and I thought that you respected me enough to know

449
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,380
我能争取到的最好结果时  我以为你会懂
that I meant it when I said it's the best I could do.

450
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,650
结果他就过来  威胁我说要上法庭
Then he comes in here threatening a trial.

451
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,770
现在好了
Well, you know what?

452
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,350
你要是看不上我们给的价
You don't like what's on the table,

453
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,390
那我们就统统撤回
we can pull the whole damn thing.

454
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,180
跟你说了他不是在开玩笑的
I told you he wasn't messing around.

455
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,090
你说对了
You were right about that.

456
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,800
但是上法庭这个决定也是对的
Now I'm right about taking this to trial.

457
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,430
你什么也没说对
You aren't right about anything.

458
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,040
我欠你的  我还过了  我们结束了
I owed you. I paid up. We're done.

459
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,480
不  我们没完  我还是不会
No, we're not done, and I'm still not

460
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,980
推荐我的客户接受这个提议
recommending this offer to my clients.

461
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,540
那真是太可惜了  他们已经签掉了
Well, that's too bad, because they already signed off.

462
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,110
什么
What?

463
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,540
我们来之前你就跟客户通过气了
You talked to our clients before we even went in there?

464
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,830
是的
You're damn right I did.

465
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,400
我们已经试过了  没用
We took a shot, and it didn't work.

466
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,410
现在呢  我们有义务
Now, in the meantime, we had an obligation

467
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,090
把他们的提议告诉客户  所以我就这么做了
to show their offer to our clients, and I did.

468
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,930
别给我在这儿扯他妈的淡
Don't give me some bullshit justification.

469
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,280
你背着我做事
You went behind my back.

470
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,830
我没背着你做事  我是越过你做事
I didn't go behind your back. I went over your head.

471
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,880
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

472
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,670
你知道我说的是什么
You know what the hell I'm talking about.

473
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,810
我去找了你老板的老板  你知道吗
I went to your boss's boss, and you know what?

474
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,380
她跟我的看法是一样的
She and I see things the same way.

475
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,920
从我的角度来看  这个案子已经结束了
And as far as I'm concerned, this case is settled.

476
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,310
二位请坐  我们马上开始
Why don't you two have a seat? I suggest we get right to it.

477
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,390
等一下  埃斯特呢
Wait a second, where's Esther?

478
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,540
她不来了  由我全权代表她
She won't be joining us, but I've been authorized

479
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,890
来进行谈判
to negotiate on her behalf.

480
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,530
不  不行  她不来我什么都不会同意的
No. No, I'm not agreeing to anything without her here.

481
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,580
那是因为你不是真心来谈判的
That's because you don't really want to negotiate,

482
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,060
你只是还想和她有所联系
you just want to stay connected to her,

483
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,130
但这是不可能的
and that's not gonna happen.

484
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,470
我不知道你是什么时候转做离婚律师的
I don't know when you decided to become a divorce attorney,

485
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,920
但这事儿不是这么干的
but that's not how it works.

486
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,270
我没转做离婚律师
I didn't become a divorce attorney

487
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,680
因为这只是小打小闹罢了
because it's the minor leagues,

488
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,310
但这就是我做事的方式
but this is how it works with me.

489
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,830
这是什么鬼
What the hell is this?

490
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,740
我们的新方案  什么都不给你
That's our new offer, nothing.

491
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,520
太扯了
This is bullshit.

492
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,610
你认为你该分得
You thinking you deserve even 20%

493
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,660
我们客户公司的20%才是胡扯
of our client's business is bullshit.

494
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,230
所以  你要么接受
So you're either gonna accept the terms that

495
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,740
你和埃斯特先前的条款
you and Esther agreed to,

496
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,010
要么接受我们的新方案
or you can take our new offer.

497
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,650
随你们怎么威胁
You can threaten all you want,

498
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,590
但我的客户有权分得属于他的财产
but my client has a right to what's his,

499
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,460
也就是公司的一半
and that's half the company,

500
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,700
因为这是十二年前  你的客户答应过的
because 12 years ago, that's what your client agreed to.

501
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,140
我当时不仅要成为埃斯特的丈夫
See, I wasn't just gonna be Esther's husband.

502
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,840
我还要当医生
I was gonna be a doctor,

503
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,320
但埃斯特的公司刚起步
but I put that on hold

504
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,260
我就搁置了这个计划
while Esther got her company off the ground,

505
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,140
我跟她说了我的想法后
and when I said I was willing to do that,

506
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,150
她说会把公司分我一半
she said I'd get half.

507
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,650
这构成了强制性口头契约
Which constitutes an enforceable verbal contract.

508
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,240
我不在乎埃斯特在不在
So I don't care whether Esther's here or not.

509
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,520
她承诺与我共度一生
She promised to spend our lives together,

510
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,330
现在她要违背那个诺言
and she's breaking that promise.

511
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,840
对于这点  我无计可施
There's nothing I can do about that one,

512
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,750
但我非常确定  我会让她遵守另一个承诺
but I'm sure as hell gonna hold her to the other one.

513
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,030
你没有证据证明她许下过这样的承诺
You have no proof she ever made that promise.

514
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,170
去问你的客户吧
Ask your client about it,

515
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,960
当她宣誓作证的时候
because when we depose her under oath,

516
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,150
我们一定会问她
you can rest assured we will.

517
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,100
是你批准了和解方案
You authorized the settlement?

518
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,390
能好好说话吗
You want to change that tone?

519
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,250
不  不能  你让罗伯特・赞恩
No, I don't, because you told Robert Zane

520
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,160
把我当合伙人
to treat me like a partner,

521
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,960
可你回过身来  又对我捆手捆脚
and then you turned around, and you cut my legs out.

522
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,870
我那么说  是因为你是我的代表
I told him that because you were my proxy,

523
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,560
可你对我没尽到代理义务
but you're not my proxy with me.

524
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,700
我不喜欢我的决定被质疑
And I don't appreciate my decisions being questioned.

525
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,050
你看过那他们的协议吗
Did you even look at that offer?

526
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,450
迈克  我要跟你解释一下
Mike, I'm going to explain something to you

527
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,270
你既然这么气势汹汹来找我
that, based on your approach to this conversation,

528
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,940
显然还不明白
you clearly don't understand.

529
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,600
开庭将花费数百万
This trial will cost millions.

530
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,240
阿卡迪亚基金有的是钱
And Arcadian has deep pockets.

531
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,670
那他们也不会找着拿钱去冒险
And they're not looking to empty them on a gamble.

532
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,450
所以都是因为钱
So this is all just about the money.

533
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,030
你是三岁小孩吗
Were you born yesterday?

534
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,460
客户要的是钱
The clients are looking for money.

535
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,660
我们要赚钱
We're looking for money.

536
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,420
保险公司想要保住钱
The insurance company's looking to keep money.

537
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,820
永远都是钱的事
It's always about the money.

538
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,900
如果你有点种  我们会赚多得多的钱
And if you had some balls, we'd get a whole lot more.

539
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,110
听好了  我不知道你觉得跑来找我
Listen to me, I don't know what you thought marching in here

540
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,050
除了惹我生气还能有什么用
was going to do other than piss me off,

541
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,680
但你给我从哪来回哪去
but you're going to march the hell back out

542
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,810
比起跟你解释普世真理
because I have better things to do with my time

543
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,400
我有更重要的事要做
than to explain to you how the world works.

544
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,680
我收到你的消息了
Hey, I got your message.

545
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,510
杰弗里签协议了吗
Jeffrey signed the agreement?

546
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,480
签了
He did.

547
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,200
只差你的签名了
All it needs is your John Hancock.

548
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,270
等等  这不是20%  是50%
Wait, this doesn't say 20%. It says 50%.

549
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,840
抱歉  我是不是忘了说
Oh, I'm sorry, did I forget to mention

550
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,280
他说你曾答应把公司分他一半
that he said you promised him 50% of your company

551
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,660
因为他推迟了上医学院的计划
for putting off medical school?

552
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,430
因为很显然  你忘了告诉我
Because you sure forgot to mention that to me.

553
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,560
你在开玩笑吧
You have got to be kidding me.

554
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,550
你怎么能不告诉我呢
How could you not tell me that?

555
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,440
因为这只是十二年前
Because it was a throwaway conversation

556
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,580
我们在新泽西高速路上开车时随口一说
we had 12 years ago on the New Jersey turnpike.

557
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,770
他可不觉得是随口一说  他会利用这点
Well, it wasn't throwaway to him, and he's gonna use it

558
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,180
因为他觉得自己被背叛了
because he's feeling betrayed.

559
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,560
我才不在乎他的感受
Well, I don't really care what he's feeling

560
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,700
搞外遇的是他又不是我
because he's the one who had the affair.

561
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,060
你想知道我们为什么离婚
You wanted to know the circumstances of our divorce.

562
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,890
这就是理由
Well, that's what they are.

563
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,330
所以我才想离开他
That's why I'm leaving him.

564
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,930
我知道你不会明白
I am sure you wouldn't understand what's it like

565
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,770
爱人不忠是什么感受
to experience infidelity.

566
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,290
我明白  我也知道
I would, and I do,

567
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,250
但这不能改变你许下口头契约的事实
but that doesn't change the fact that you made a contract.

568
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,680
另一份合同怎么算  20%那份
What about our other contract? 20%.

569
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,780
原始协议优先级更高
The original agreement supersedes it,

570
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,760
出轨也不能改变
and an affair doesn't change that.

571
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,930
但他没有证据
Except he doesn't have any proof

572
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,870
我当初和他有过这一协议
I ever made the original agreement.

573
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,740
埃斯特  他们会让你宣誓作证
Esther, they're gonna put you under oath

574
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,710
然后直接问你  你们有没有这一协议
and ask you point-blank if this happened.

575
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,520
那我就说没有
And I'm going to say it didn't.

576
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,420
那是作伪证  我不能让你那样做
That's perjury, and I'm not gonna let you do that.

577
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:46,830
你以为你是谁
What are you,

578
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,570
一个从来不会为了赢而越线的光明骑士吗
some white knight who never crosses the line to win?

579
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,530
不  但我不会让你
No, but I'm not gonna let you make a decision

580
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,370
一时头脑发热
in the heat of the moment

581
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,670
做出会令你后悔终身的决定
that you'll regret for the rest of your life.

582
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,700
那你最好找到别的办法让这份协议失效
Well, then you better find some other way to void this deal,

583
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,450
因为我绝不可能让我那混蛋丈夫
because there's no way I'm giving my shit bag husband

584
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,180
拿走我的一半财产
half of everything I own.

585
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,970
我需要你找出口头合约的
I need you to find every loophole there is

586
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,740
所有可能漏洞
around verbal contracts.

587
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,700
所以杰弗里说的是实话
So Jeffrey was telling the truth?

588
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,650
是的  而她宁死也不愿意
Yes, and she'd rather slit her wrists

589
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,780
给他一半财产  而且我不怪她
than give him 50%, and I don't blame her.

590
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,780
但是她主动提出离婚的  所以...
Yeah, but she's the one who's leaving him, so--

591
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,000
他搞外遇了  是吗
He cheated on her, didn't he?

592
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,860
那是我们的委托人
Well, that's between our client

593
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,560
和她准前夫之间的事
and her soon-to-be ex-husband,

594
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,240
反正我绝不会让他
and I have no intention of letting him

595
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,520
就这样占她便宜的
get the better of her.

596
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,850
怎么了
What?

597
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,010
这激起了你的保护欲  很贴心
You're being protective. It's sweet.

598
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,900
听我说  我们保护埃斯特
Okay, listen to me, we're protecting Esther

599
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,260
是因为这就是我们的职责
because it's our job to protect her.

600
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,170
如果我们想不出办法解决这件事
And if we don't figure a way out of this,

601
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,010
她就会损失数百万美元
she's gonna lose millions of dollars,

602
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,510
所以你想要观察我们两个的事  随便你
so you want to make observations about the two of us,

603
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,460
但要等我们赢了以后
do it all you want after we've won.

604
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,540
我马上去做
I'm on it.

605
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:58,070
好了  这是最终协议备忘  这是核准授权
Okay, so final deal memos here, check authorizations here.

606
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:02,300
现在只要让凯尔顿签完字  我们就完事了
Now all we need to do is get Kelton to sign, and we are done.

607
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,080
迈克  我知道你认为这个协议烂透了
Mike, I know you think this deal sucks,

608
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,640
但毕竟还有好的一面
but there is a silver lining.

609
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,180
我们又能一起工作了
we got to work together again.

610
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,800
怎么了
What?

611
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,740
我只是回想起我们刚认识的时候
I was just thinking about when we started.

612
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,380
谁会想到和你一起工作
Who would've thought that working with you

613
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,650
会是好的一面
would ever have been a silver lining?

614
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,440
我
Me?

615
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,530
是啊  你
Yeah, you.

616
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,340
你就好到哪去吗
What about you?

617
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,670
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

618
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,030
我从一开始就一直很友善的
I have been a gentleman since day one.

619
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,400
-真的吗  -当然
- Really? - Yes.

620
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,890
你不记得飞机那件事了吗
Remember the whole airplane incident?

621
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,090
我记得吗  当然记得  是你...
Do I? Yes, you were the one who--

622
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,370
等等  等等等等
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

623
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,750
等一下  达美金融
Wait a second. Delta Financial.

624
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,400
他们怎么了
What about them?

625
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,550
罗伯特・赞恩的桌子上有一本
There was a brochure for Delta Bauer Financial

626
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,260
达美-鲍尔金融的手册
on Robert Zane's desk.

627
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,380
上面说明  他们是
And on top of that, they were listed

628
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,330
阿卡迪亚基金的一家子公司
as a subsidiary on Arcadian's annual report.

629
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,840
他们的子基金公司多着呢
As are 50 other funds.

630
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,440
可是其它基金公司的手册
50 other funds that don't have a brochure

631
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,770
都没有出现在罗伯特・赞恩的桌子上
on Robert Zane's desk.

632
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,760
-迈克  -卡特里娜
- Mike-- - Katrina,

633
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,630
我需要知道他们是不是你们的客户
I need to know if they're one of your clients.

634
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,760
你明知道我不能告诉你
You know I can't tell you that.

635
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,810
那就说明是了
Okay, well, you just did.

636
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,460
我还需要知道他们是不是拥有凯尔顿的股份
Now I need to know if they own shares of Kelton.

637
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,760
我不知道他们有没有股份  我也不会去查
I don't know if they own shares, and I'm not gonna find out.

638
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,450
你不在乎罗伯特・赞恩为了一家对冲基金受益
You don't care if Robert Zane is manipulating a case

639
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,480
而操纵一个案子吗
to service a hedge fund?

640
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,690
我在不在乎无所谓
It doesn't matter if I care.

641
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,370
我不能违反律师委托人保密协议
I can't violate attorney-client privilege.

642
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,800
你说你欠我一个人情
You said you owe me.

643
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,590
而你说我其实是欠瑞秋的
And you said I owe Rachel.

644
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,070
卡特里娜  拜托
Katrina, please.

645
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,050
你说罗伯特一定会为委托人的利益着想
You said that Robert is doing right by his clients.

646
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,630
我需要知道他在为哪个委托人的利益着想
Well, I just need to know which clients he's doing right by.

647
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,950
你有时间吗
Do you have a minute?

648
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,350
我上次这样问你的时候  你告诉我说没时间
The last time I asked you that, you told me the answer was no.

649
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,050
然后我还是花时间听你说话了
And I still gave you the minute.

650
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,370
我正好在忙着
Well, I happen to be in the middle

651
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,670
收拾路易妹妹的烂摊子  所以
of trying to get Louis's sister out of a huge mess, so--

652
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,530
我就是想和你谈这个
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

653
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,630
路易答应不会插手的
Louis promised to stay out of this.

654
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,060
没他的事  我不是他派来的
And he is, and I'm not here because he asked me to be.

655
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,580
我来是因为我在乎他
I'm here because I care about him and--

656
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,990
这跟我没关系
That's not my problem.

657
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,490
哈维  我不是你的敌人
Harvey, I'm not the enemy here.

658
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,890
而路易是你的合作伙伴和朋友
And Louis is your partner and your friend,

659
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,720
现在  他需要一颗定心丸
And right now, he needs a little reassurance.

660
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,390
我告诉过你了  我不是
And I told you before, I'm not the guy

661
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,100
那个会在你害怕时给你一个拥抱的人
That gives you a hug when you're scared.

662
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,000
我是在你最需要的时候能帮助你取胜的人
I'm the guy that wins when you need it the most.

663
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,770
你为什么就不能
Why can't you for once--

664
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,670
你知道吗  唐娜  我向你求助的时候
You know what, donna, when I came to you for help,

665
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,430
你说我没有资格再那么做了
You said that I don't get to do that anymore.

666
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,150
你现在也没有资格这么做了
Well, you don't get to do this anymore.

667
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,580
现在  请原谅  我还有事要做
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

668
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,360
你知道吗  哈维
You know what, Harvey?

669
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,070
路易本来不敢让你接手这个案子
Louis was afraid to let you take this case,

670
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,430
我让他别担心  因为我相信
And I told him not to be because I trusted

671
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,770
最终
that at the end of the day,

672
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,480
你会记得我们是一家人
You'd remember that we're family.

673
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,780
但也许我错了
But maybe I was wrong.

674
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,210
因为十二年来  我都把你放在第一位
Because I spent 12 years putting you first,

675
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,680
我终于决定为自己做些事情的时候
and the day I finally decided to do something for myself,

676
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,240
你不止不再把我当家人
You didn't just stop treating me like family,

677
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,750
你开始把我当陌生人
You started treating me like a stranger.

678
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,020
而这比把我当做敌人
And for your information, that is a thousand times worse

679
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,020
还要伤人一千倍
Than if you treated me like your enemy.

680
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,460
路易  你有什么事吗
Louis, did you need something?

681
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,360
我想让你知道我为你骄傲
I need you to know how proud I am of you,

682
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,530
看到你这样努力工作
'cause seeing you working like this

683
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,270
使我想起了你如何为法学院入学考试奋战
Just reminds me how you persevered with the LSATs,

684
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,450
如何进入了法学院  而现在
and how you got into law school, and now--

685
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,950
路易  我是不会向你透露埃斯特案子的情况的
Louis, I'm not telling you about Esther's case.

686
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,440
那要你还有什么用
Well, then what the hell good are you?

687
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,920
路易  你答应过哈维  不会插手的
Louis, you promised Harvey you would stay out of it.

688
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,270
我只是想知道发生了什么
I just need to know what happened.

689
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,140
什么发生了什么
What happened with what?

690
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,580
他们之间怎么了
What happened with them.

691
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,410
我恨杰弗里不是秘密
I mean, it's no secret that I hated Jeffrey,

692
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,610
但埃斯特  她爱他
But Esther, she loved him,

693
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,260
他们就这样
and for them to just--

694
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,730
我得知道为什么
I need to know why.

695
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,640
他有外遇了
He cheated on her.

696
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,850
那你答应我  你们两个
Well, then you promise me that the two of you...

697
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,860
不要放过那个混蛋
stick it to that sack of shit.

698
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,660
你觉得我在做什么呢
What do you think I'm working on?

699
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,010
文书什么的都搞定了吗
We're all squared away on the paperwork?

700
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,400
在你告诉我你是否知情之前
No, we're not squared away on shit

701
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,060
我们屁都没搞定
until you tell me whether or not you knew.

702
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,380
你敢再说一遍吗
You want to run that by me again?

703
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,110
达美金融  你的客户
Delta Financial, your client.

704
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,130
你知道他们巨额投资了凯尔顿保险公司吗
Did you know they were heavily invested in Kelton?

705
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,740
你在指控我做了什么吗
Are you accusing me of something, Mike?

706
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,150
你最好注意你的言辞
Because you better watch what you say.

707
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,530
你还是没回答我的问题
You still haven't answered my question.

708
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,380
你知道资助我们的对冲基金的子公司
Did you know a subsidiary of the hedge fund

709
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,730
刚刚购入了大量凯尔顿保险公司的股份吗
backing our suit just purchased a huge block of Kelton shares?

710
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,230
我是他们的律师  不是证券分析师
I am their lawyer, not a stock analyst.

711
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,370
那你或许可以解释一下
Then maybe you can explain to me

712
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,280
为什么你桌上有一本他们的宣传册
why you have one of their brochures on your desk?

713
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,800
听着  过目不忘小子
Okay, listen to me, Mr. Photographic memory.

714
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,880
在这本宣传册下面是另外
Underneath this brochure are another 35

715
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,720
35本堆了一年半的册子
that have been piling up there for a year and a half

716
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,010
因为我打算进行投资
Because I'm looking to invest my money

717
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,530
而这笔钱有一天会属于你们的孩子
that someday may be going to your children.

718
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,660
你以为我们想要你通过将和解金额
Wait, you think we want money that comes from some stock

719
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,190
压到低于正常预期而使股票暴涨
that went through the roof because you authorized

720
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,860
得到的钱吗
a settlement lower than street expectations?

721
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,140
好的  你说完了  现在该我说了
Okay, you've said your piece. Now I'm gonna say mine.

722
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,690
你出生前我就开始
I have been a lawyer and an officer of the court

723
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,400
做律师和法院人员了
longer than you've breathed air,

724
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,130
我现在看着你的眼睛
and I'm looking you straight in the eye

725
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,480
告诉你我是个正直的人
and telling you that I am an honest man.

726
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,830
作为一个正直的人
You know as an honest man

727
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,730
你应该知道我们发现了这个
that now that we've discovered this,

728
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,250
由于利益冲突我们必须披露它
we have to disclose it as conflict of interest.

729
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,490
那就用超小号字体把它埋在文件里
Then bury it, deep in the fine print,

730
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,470
因为我给出的建议与它无关
because it had nothing to do with my recommendation,

731
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,930
我不会让它毁了这次交易
and I'm not gonna let it blow this goddamn deal.

732
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,750
这什么时候成了一次取证会
Since when did this become a deposition?

733
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,630
原本不是  但你似乎急着逼问埃斯特
It didn't, but since you seemed so anxious to ask Esther

734
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,340
她以前说过的话
about what she said in the past,

735
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,920
我想我可以给大家省省力气
I thought I'd just save us all the trouble

736
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,850
亲自把取证给做了
and get it on the record myself.

737
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,760
什么  我从没同意过...
What? I never agreed--

738
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,780
你承诺过要给杰弗里公司的一半  是吗
You promised Jeffrey 50% of your company, didn't you?

739
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,210
没错
Yes, I did.

740
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:53,830
这不就结了
Then it's settled.

741
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,100
还没呢
Well, not quite.

742
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,300
既然我们的委托人
Now that our client has admitted

743
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,350
承认了那个协议
that she made the agreement,

744
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,930
我们想谈谈她许下承诺时
we'd like to discuss the circumstances

745
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,100
她所处的情况
under which she did.

746
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,730
你说情况是什么意思
What do you mean the circumstances?

747
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,040
她答应给我50%  就是这样
She promised me 50%, period.

748
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,700
不  她答应给你50%是因为你放弃了
No, she promised you 50% because you forfeited

749
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,110
读医学院的机会
your admission to medical school.

750
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,400
没错  我放弃了去斯坦福
That's right, and instead of going to Stanford,

751
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,000
留在家里照顾家庭
I stayed home and took care of our family.

752
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,140
那么为什么没有任何
Then why is there no record of you

753
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,010
斯坦福录取你的记录呢
ever being admitted to Stanford?

754
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,690
其他学校的录取记录也没有
Or any school, for that matter?

755
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:24,420
只有一叠拒信
Just a pile of rejection letters.

756
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,730
你骗我
You lied to me?

757
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,130
荒唐
This is ridiculous.

758
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,710
很多人都不是第一次
Lots of people don't get into medical school

759
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,820
就能申请到上医学院的
on the first try.

760
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,600
你第一次就想把我半个公司抢走
You were gonna take half of my company on the first try.

761
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,340
30%
30%.

762
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,930
他休想从我亲手建立的公司
He's not getting another penny

763
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,990
再拿走一毛钱
of the business I built myself.

764
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,040
你想说你拥有的这一切都是靠你自己
You want to talk about doing things yourself?

765
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,470
那是谁在你忙着烤松饼
Who do you think stayed home and kept our family together

766
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,480
忙到没时间给孩子做晚餐时
while you were too busy baking muffins

767
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,830
留在家里稳固家庭
to make dinner for your kids?

768
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,430
你别拿母亲职责来说我
Don't you dare attack me as a mother!

769
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,200
是你对我不忠
You cheated on me!

770
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,280
埃斯特  对不起
Esther, I'm sorry.

771
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,400
我的确做了错事
I made a mistake.

772
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:00,520
但我确实为你放弃了一切
But I did give up everything for you.

773
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,420
我暂停了自己的人生追求
I put my life on hold.

774
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,520
为了成全你的梦想放弃了自己的
I sacrificed my dream for yours.

775
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,350
我不可能再追回逝去的岁月了
I'm never gonna get those years back.

776
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,560
不  杰弗里
No, Jeffrey.

777
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,900
我们曾经拥有一切
We had everything,

778
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,190
是你把这一切都毁了
and you ruined it.

779
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,210
行了  可以了
All right, that's enough.

780
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,640
我们最终报价你们已经拿到了
You have our final offer.

781
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,930
这次最好别再是罗伯特・赞恩的事
This better not be about Robert Zane again.

782
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,400
-给我一分钟就好  -见鬼
- Just give me one minute. - God damn it.

783
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,690
他有一个客户买了凯尔顿的股份
One of his clients purchased shares of Kelton,

784
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,520
如果他们按保密信息处理...
and if they acted on privileged information--

785
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,480
我懂法律
I know the law.

786
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,950
那你知道这么做轻则违反职业道德
Well, then you know it's unethical at best

787
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,410
重则违反法律
and illegal at worst.

788
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,210
你要我怎么做
What do you want from me?

789
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,600
我知道你觉得他是否事前知晓
I want to know if you think he knew.

790
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,960
这有什么分别
What the hell difference does that make?

791
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,900
区别在于这算合法结案
It's the difference between a legitimate settlement

792
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,840
还是股价操纵
and stock manipulation.

793
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,450
你是说这会让他变成诈骗犯
You mean it would make him a fraud?

794
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,010
这是两码事  你知道
This isn't the same thing, and you know it.

795
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,000
我不想让玩弄我的委托人
I'm not trying to screw over my clients.

796
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,510
你为什么要提起那茬
Why would you even bring that up right now?

797
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,320
因为你当初求我接这个案子
Because you begged me for this case

798
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,670
还要和那个人合作
and a chance to work with that man.

799
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,060
如果他和保险公司勾结
And if he colluded with them,

800
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,380
我们可以逼他们给更高的赔偿
we can stick a better settlement down their throats.

801
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,830
你真觉得罗伯特・赞恩会卑鄙到做那种事
Do you really think Robert Zane is dirty enough to do that?

802
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,930
我不知道  但我很难相信
I don't know, but I find it hard to believe

803
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,480
他会愚钝到忽略此事
that he's dumb enough not to know.

804
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,500
我爸爸才不蠢
My dad's not dumb.

805
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,570
-也不卑鄙  -瑞秋
- And he's not dirty. - Rachel...

806
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,870
上次路易说他阴险
And the last time someone called him shady,

807
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,580
你还几乎要举拳打他
it was Louis, and you almost punched him over it.

808
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,390
这是两码事
This is different.

809
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,020
就是一码事
This is the same.

810
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,630
你要打他是因为侮辱我
You were gonna punch him because an attack on me

811
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,140
就是侮辱你
is an attack on you.

812
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,970
现在我说侮辱我父亲就是侮辱我
Well, attack on my father is an attack on me,

813
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,280
而做这件事的人正是你
and you're the one who's doing it.

814
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,260
我没有侮辱谁
Nobody's attacking anybody.

815
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,210
迈克  你曾经
Mike, you once came to me

816
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,430
要求我不要轻易对你下定论
asking me to give you the benefit of the doubt,

817
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,660
我给了你机会
and I gave it to you.

818
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,070
所以你至少也该给他机会
So the least you can do is give it to him.

819
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,880
我本来期待你能给我好消息呢
I was hoping you had good news,

820
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,050
但你在这儿自斟自饮好像不是因为成交了
but you're not pouring that drink because we have a deal.

821
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,460
是还没成交  但也可以成交了
We don't, but we can.

822
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,090
你什么意思
What are you saying?

823
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,260
我的意思是他们要求30%
I'm saying they offered 30%,

824
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,960
我谈到了25%
and I talked them down to 25%.

825
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,570
我凭什么接受25%
And why should I take it?

826
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:14,070
因为纠缠不放已经不再是他了
Because he's not the one dragging this fight out anymore.

827
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,190
是你
You are.

828
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
而且不管你相不相信
And whether or not you believe

829
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,540
他为你放弃了一切  这都是事实
he gave up everything for you, he does.

830
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,890
我难道没权利生气吗
Tell me I don't have the right to be angry.

831
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,850
你知道我为什么根本不考虑
Do you know why I never even considered

832
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,290
做离婚律师吗
becoming a divorce attorney?

833
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,920
大材小用吗
Because it's beneath you.

834
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,380
因为牵涉到孩子
Because there are children involved.

835
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,810
当人们陷入离婚的泥潭
When people get caught up in divorce...

836
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,470
就会忘记生活中其实还有
they forget there are some things in life

837
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,290
比金钱重要的东西
that are more important than money.

838
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,620
好吧  哈维
Okay, Harvey.

839
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,830
25%
25%.

840
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,790
我得说  你和我想象的哈维・斯佩克特
You know, you're not exactly

841
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,160
不太一样呢
the Harvey Specter I was expecting.

842
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,180
这是好事还是坏事
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

843
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,730
好事
A good thing.

844
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,850
你和我对路易妹妹的想象也相去甚远
You're not exactly the louis's sister I was expecting.

845
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,790
这又是好事还是坏事
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

846
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,360
好事  绝对是好事
A good thing. Definitely a good thing.

847
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,860
今晚你还愿意带我回家吗
Would you like to take me home tonight?

848
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,230
愿意
I would.

849
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,060
但你得先把这个签了
But I need you to sign that first.

850
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,220
为什么
Why is that?

851
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,350
因为签了之后你就不是我的委托人了
Because then you won't be my client anymore.

852
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,730
很有原则嘛
A man with a code.

853
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,460
你可能还真是个光明骑士
Maybe you are a white knight after all.

854
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,640
行了  我们走吧
Come on, let's get out of here.

855
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,420
路易  大半夜的  你到底
Louis, it's midnight. What's--

856
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,960
哈维坑了埃斯特
Harvey's screwing Esther.

857
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,740
-什么  -你看
- What? - Look at this.

858
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,170
这是埃斯特签的协议
It's an agreement that Esther signed

859
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,220
同意给杰弗里25%
that agrees to give Jeffrey 25%.

860
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,090
这比她答应给那混蛋的多了5%
That's 5% more than she needs to pay that son of a bitch.

861
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,970
你在哪看到的
Where did you get this?

862
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,890
我走在走廊里
Well, I was walking down the hall.

863
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,490
看到两个杯子一瓶威士忌  还有这个
I saw two glasses, a bottle of scotch, and that.

864
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,730
他灌醉了她  以此报复我
He got her drunk, so he could screw me over.

865
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,590
哈维绝不会干这种事的
Okay, there is no way Harvey would ever do that.

866
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,160
你大半夜吵醒我就为了说这个啊
You woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me that?

867
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,360
唐娜  多给5%就是三百万
Donna, 5% extra is $3 million.

868
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,550
你怎么解释这个
How do you explain that?

869
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,040
-解释不了  -我来解释
- I can't. - I can.

870
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,360
他是要借坑我家人来报复我
He's trying to get me back about his compensation

871
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,880
为他酬金的事
by trying to screw over another litt.

872
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,200
所以我需要你
So what I need you to do--

873
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,990
路易  我需要做的唯一一件事
Louis, the only thing that I need to do

874
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,690
就是告诉你你疯了  然后回屋睡觉
is tell you you're crazy and go back to sleep.

875
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,370
如果到明早之前  除当面质问哈维之外
And if you do anything between now and tomorrow

876
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,990
你做了任何事  我发誓
other than confront Harvey face-to-face, so help me God,

877
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,090
你明天一早就没有秘书了
you will not have a secretary in the morning.

878
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,580
我打算放下这件事了
I'm letting it go.

879
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,160
这和你
Does that have something to do

880
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,010
一大早去的地方有关吗
with where you've been so early in the morning?

881
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,570
有
Yeah.

882
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,350
你去见我爸爸了
You went to see my dad?

883
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,850
我去见艾玛・鲍尔了
I went to see Emma Powell,

884
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,090
问她对协议的看法
asked her how she felt about the settlement.

885
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,650
她说这会改变她的生活
She said it would change her life.

886
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,860
你就跟她说钱给少了
You said it wasn't enough money.

887
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,450
她都没提钱的事
She didn't even mention the money.

888
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,290
她说对她来说  这个结果证明了
She said, for her, the settlement was proof

889
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,420
凯尔顿在她丈夫的事情上有过错
that Kelton didn't do right by her husband,

890
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,090
而那是她唯一需要的
and that was all she needed.

891
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:36,980
好吧
Okay.

892
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,780
所以就因为原告满意了
So because the plaintiff was happy,

893
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,680
突然之间  你就觉得我爸爸是个诚实的人了
all of a sudden, you think my dad's an honest man.

894
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,390
不是
No.

895
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,950
我去是为了看能不能让这事过去
I went there to see if I could let it go.

896
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,140
我知道你爸爸是个诚实的人
I know your dad is an honest man

897
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,260
因为他养成了你这样的女儿
because he's raised someone like you.

898
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,040
你说得对
You were right.

899
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,320
我不该质疑他的正直
I never should have questioned his integrity.

900
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,510
我还有一点也是对的
I was also right

901
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,390
你就不该接这个案子
that you never should've taken this case.

902
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,650
不  那件事你错了
No, you were wrong about that.

903
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,510
我跟你说过  我们可能会吵架
I told you we might fight,

904
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,390
但那会让我们更亲密
but it would bring us closer together,

905
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,610
那也确实实现了
and it did.

906
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,180
不仅是我跟你爸爸
And not just me and your father.

907
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,290
你指什么
What does that mean?

908
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,000
还有你跟你爸爸
I mean you and your father.

909
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,020
我从没见过你那样毫不犹豫地维护他
I have never seen you leap to his defense like that.

910
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,800
我毫不犹豫地维护他  有吗
I did leap to his defense, didn't I?

911
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,330
当然有
You sure did.

912
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,710
你觉得我们的女儿会毫不犹豫地维护我吗
You think our daughter will leap to my defense

913
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,950
某天  像你一样
like that one day?

914
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,760
她会的
She sure will.

915
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,110
路易  你在这里做什么
Louis, what are you doing here?

916
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,140
我来告诉你我在做什么
I'll tell you what I'm doing here.

917
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,820
我来当面跟你谈你坑了我妹妹的事
I'm coming to you face-to-face about screwing my sister.

918
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,210
你说什么
Excuse me?

919
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,350
我看了条款  哈维  简直开玩笑
I saw the terms, Harvey. They're a joke.

920
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,440
不  那些是埃斯特想要的
No, they're what Esther wanted.

921
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,240
而你发过誓  不管这事
And you swore you'd stay out of this.

922
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,000
我没管真是好事
Well, it's a good thing I didn't

923
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,460
因为她不可能想要送掉
because there's no way she wanted to give away

924
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,670
几百万美元
millions of dollars.

925
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,260
那叫退一步海阔天空
It's called being charitable in order to move on.

926
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,540
那叫杰弗里是堆垃圾
It's called Jeffrey's a piece of shit,

927
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,130
他又不是优生优育基金会
not the March of Dimes.

928
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,380
他什么都不该得
He should be getting nothing.

929
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,450
与其关注他得到了什么
Instead of being focused on what he gets,

930
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,270
你不如看看埃斯特得到了什么
you should be focused on what Esther gets,

931
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,330
她很开心
which is to be happy.

932
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,630
错了  利特家的人从不会开心
Wrong, Litts are never happy,

933
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,010
而你在利用她伤害我
and you're using her to get to me.

934
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,050
我要怎么才能用这办法伤到你呢
How the hell am I doing that?

935
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:22,770
你觉得我利用
You think I went after your money

936
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,640
调整律所薪资结构来抢你的钱
by changing the firm's compensation structure.

937
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,960
你是抢了我的钱
You did come after my money!

938
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,400
现在你在抢埃斯特的钱来扳回一局
And now you're going after Esther's to even the score.

939
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,640
我要想扳回一局
If I wanted to even the score,

940
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,200
是不会去找你妹妹的
I wouldn't come after your sister.

941
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,600
我会找你
I'd be coming after you.

942
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,850
你听好了 
And for your information,

943
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,420
我之所以能说服她选择原谅 
I convinced her to be forgiving by telling her

944
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,100
是因为我告诉她
that there are some things in life

945
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,440
世上有很多事比钱重要
that are more important than money.

946
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,020
胡说  这话你自己都不相信
Bullshit! You don't believe that.

947
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,650
路易  我没想做这事报复你
Louis, I didn't take this to get back at you.

948
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,130
我做这事是因为这是我们停战
I took it because it was a chance to bury the hatchet

949
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,650
然后往前走的机会
and move on.

950
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,810
所以你要么让那些条款生效
So either let these terms stand,

951
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,250
要么就像你平时一样  搞砸一切
or do what you always do and screw everything up.

952
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,910
罗伯特  我很高兴你来了
Robert, I'm glad you're here--

953
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,460
你做了什么
What the hell did you do?

954
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,510
你指的是什么
What are you talking about?

955
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,560
我去见了艾玛・鲍尔
I went to see Emma Powell,

956
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,410
但我发誓  我没有破坏和解
But I swear to god, I did not undermine the settlement.

957
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,700
我不是说那个
I'm not talking about that.

958
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,230
我在说你背着我去找阿卡迪亚基金
I'm talking about you going behind my back to Arcadian.

959
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,880
我没去
I didn't do that.

960
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,060
在你上次跟我说了那些之后
Oh, you expect me to believe that

961
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,110
你还指望我相信你吗
after all the shit you told me the last time I saw you?

962
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,960
你信不信无所谓
You can believe it or not,

963
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,460
但我要告诉你  我什么都没做
but I'm telling you I didn't do anything.

964
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,340
-那是谁做的  -是我
- Then who did? - I did.

965
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,280
你说如果他跟阿卡迪亚基金有串通
You said if he colluded with Arcadian,

966
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,890
我们就可以逼他们出一大笔和解金
then we could shove a bigger settlement down their throats.

967
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,440
但他没必要勾结
But he didn't have to collude,

968
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,230
因为阿卡迪亚基金已经拿到那份和解协议了
because Arcadian already had access to that settlement.

969
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,260
这样无论如何都属于内幕交易
which makes it insider trading anyway.

970
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,330
我还向他们指出
And I pointed out to them

971
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,220
如果他们只把他们的股份
that if they were to divest their shares

972
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,100
抛售给那些不掌握内幕消息的客户
to our clients who don't have insider knowledge,

973
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,810
那他们就没有违法
then they've done nothing wrong.

974
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,200
没有造成损失
No harm done.

975
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,770
损失就是你害我失去了我客户
The harm is you lost me my client

976
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,060
还让我当了傻子
and made me look like a fool.

977
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,540
不  罗伯特  是他们拿你当了傻子
No, Robert, they did that

978
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,100
他们向你隐瞒了他们的作为
by not telling you what they did.

979
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,400
意味着你失去的这个客户
Which means the client you lost

980
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,710
早已违法了
was breaking the law.

981
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,470
更糟糕的是
And worse than that,

982
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,030
他们跟自己的律师撒谎
they were lying to their lawyer.

983
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,250
所以你觉得这很好玩吗
So you think this is funny?

984
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,380
没有  我没觉得
No, I don't.

985
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,510
我觉得你未来的女婿
I think your future son-in-law

986
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,790
相信你与此没有任何关系
trusted you had nothing to do with it

987
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,330
并且帮你避免了犯罪
and then saved your ass from committing a crime.

988
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,260
不...客气
You're...welcome?

989
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,710
谢谢
Thank you.

990
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,400
还有请你节哀
And you have my condolences.

991
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,340
-节什么哀  -因为要跟他打交道
- For what? - For having to deal with him.

992
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,300
你根本不理解有多麻烦
Oh, you have no idea.

993
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,890
看这里  我还在这里呢  伙计们
Hey, right here. I'm standing right here, guys.

994
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,740
我请你喝杯酒怎么样
Can I buy you a drink?

995
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,260
如果你们需要修补  挽救什么
If you guys, you know, need anything fixed or saved

996
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,740
别人不会的东西  随时找我
that no one else seems to be able to do, I'll be right here.

997
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,630
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

998
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,800
我想告诉你我有多么感激你
I wanted to tell you how grateful I am.

999
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,460
-你没必要这样  -不
- You don't need to do that. - Yes.

1000
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,530
真的
I do.

1001
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,090
这个烂摊子
This whole mess

1002
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:56,050
是我经历过最艰难的事情
has been the hardest thing I've ever gone through.

1003
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,280
如果没有你提醒我
And I wouldn't have gotten through it

1004
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,050
真正重要的是什么  我不可能挺过来的
Without you reminding me what's really important.

1005
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,740
谢谢你这么说
Thank you for that.

1006
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,700
保重  哈维
Take care, Harvey.

1007
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,790
祝你好运  埃斯特
Good luck, Esther.

1008
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,010
顺便说一句
Oh, by the way,

1009
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,530
路易也想让我告诉你
Louis wanted me to tell you

1010
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,250
他非常感谢
how grateful he is too.

1011
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,300
-哈维  -路易
- Harvey. - Louis.

1012
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,020
要我帮你做什么
What can I do for you?

1013
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,050
记得我说过  如果我要你
Remember when I said, if wanted you

1014
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,000
弥补薪金投票的事情
to make up for the compensation vote,

1015
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,670
我会直接来找你吗
I would come to you directly?

1016
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,750
现在我就来了
Well, now I am.

1017
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,830
那你说的
Well, what happened to

1018
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,920
"生活中有些事情比钱更重要"又是怎么回事
"some things in life are more important than money"?

1019
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,400
这跟钱没关系
This isn't about the money.

1020
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,600
只是为了做正确的事情
This is about making things right.

1021
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,780
我很抱歉  哈维
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1022
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,740
为什么
For what?

1023
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,520
我表现得像不知道埃斯特有多漂亮一样
I act like I don't know Esther's beautiful,

1024
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,590
但我知道
But I do.

1025
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,710
我们上初中的时候就开始了
It started when we were in junior high

1026
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,330
所有型男都想跟我一起玩
and all the cool kids would hang out with me

1027
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,020
这样他们就有机会接近她
just so they could get close to her.

1028
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,370
有时候这招管用  有时候没用
Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't,

1029
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,330
但不论如何  这阶段一结束
But either way, when it was over...

1030
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,830
他们都跟从不认识我一样
they all acted like they didn't know me at all.

1031
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,220
所以当我想到
So when I thought

1032
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,360
你在利用她来对付我  我就...
you were using her to get to me, I, uh--

1033
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,040
我没那样  路易
I wasn't doing that, Louis.

1034
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,310
我知道
I know.

1035
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,720
我会处理好薪金的问题
I'll take care of the compensation issue.

1036
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,360
需要我帮你做什么  哈维
What can I do for you, Harvey?

1037
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,170
我想谢谢你
I wanted to thank you.

1038
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,250
谢什么
For what?

1039
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,360
你的十二年
For 12 years.
