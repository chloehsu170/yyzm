1
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:32,678
在这里看日出真美
The sunrise is beautiful from up here.

2
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,330
老实说  我都不记得上次看日出是什么时候了
To be honest, I can't remember the last time I saw the sun rise.

3
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:37,383
真的
Really?

4
00:01:38,635 --> 00:01:40,906
得有点什么非常特别的事
It takes something pretty special

5
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:42,743
才能让我早上7点起床
to get me up before 7:00 a.m.

6
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:51,087
我记得  我昨晚就很特别
As I recall, I was pretty special last night.

7
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,760
你又让我惊喜了
There--you surprised me again.

8
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:57,793
事实上  这一切让我也有点意外
You know, the truth is I'm a little surprised by all this myself.

9
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,167
什么意思
What do you mean?

10
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:02,100
意思是  你消失了将近一年
Well, I mean, you disappear for nearly a year,

11
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,732
然后  突然有一天你开着雪佛兰57就来了
and then, one day, you suddenly show up in a '57 Chevy--

12
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:08,610
是法拉利72年  不过好吧
'72 Ferrari, but, yeah.

13
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:10,200
你让我倾倒
And you sweep me off my feet.

14
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:12,168
我喜欢这样
And I liked it.

15
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,865
很好  我原本不确定你会不会喜欢
That's good 'cause I wasn't sure you would.

16
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:18,366
当然了  你还不真的了解我
Of course you weren't. You don't really know me yet.

17
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:23,266
到昨天为止  我们共度了大概50个小时
Till yesterday, we'd spent about 50 hours together,

18
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:25,439
而我们大部分时间都在谈你
and we'd spent most of them talking about you.

19
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:28,503
是啊  这就是我喜欢我们恋情的地方
I know, and that's what I love about our relationship.

20
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:33,653
-哈维  -宝拉
- Harvey... - Paula...

21
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,456
你说我觉得你想说的话之前
Before you say what I think you're gonna say,

22
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,641
让我说
let me say

23
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:42,553
你或许比任何人都了解我
you may know me better than anyone.

24
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,865
现在  我也想了解你
And now I'd like to get to know you too.

25
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:46,619
那好啊
I'd like that.

26
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,862
我猜我想说的是  我采取了不理智的行为
I guess what I'm trying to say is I acted irrationally,

27
00:02:58,863 --> 00:03:02,635
但是求你  塔拉  只要再给我一次机会
but please, Tara, if you could just give me another chance...

28
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:08,051
我保证  我再不会让你失望了
I promise you that I will never let you down again.

29
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,276
你知道你不能这么说  路易
You know you can't say that, Louis.

30
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:13,672
抱歉  什么  这是我的角色扮演
Wait, I'm sorry, what? This is my role play.

31
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:15,303
我想说什么就能说什么
I can say whatever the hell I want.

32
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:17,784
我们谈过你对自己的行为提出
And we've talked about you making bold proclamations

33
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:18,912
大胆宣告的事了
about your own behavior.

34
00:03:18,913 --> 00:03:20,024
那跟这有什么关系
What does that have to do with this?

35
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:23,056
你刚保证绝不会再让塔拉失望
You just promised to never let Tara down again.

36
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:24,776
这是不切实际的
That is unrealistic.

37
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:27,296
当你不可避免地打破这一承诺时会怎样
What happens when you inevitably break that promise?

38
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:29,072
我会道歉  并保证再不那么做了
I'll apologize and promise I'll never do it again.

39
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:31,761
你看不出这模式的问题吗
And you don't see a problem with that pattern?

40
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,224
我看到的是  利普希茨医生
What I see, Dr. Lipschitz,

41
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,184
我们的谈话已经进行了46分钟
is we're 46 minutes into this session,

42
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:36,944
我还没有得到我的了结
and I haven't gotten closure yet.

43
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:39,262
路易  我们就你母亲
Louis, we spent seven years on the fact

44
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:42,035
逼你穿埃斯特的旧衣服的事谈了七年
that your mother made you wear Esther's hand-me-ups.

45
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:45,020
你50分钟内是得不到了结的
You're not getting closure in 50 minutes.

46
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:46,737
那我付钱给你做什么
Well, then what the hell am I paying you for?

47
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:49,793
好吧  路易
Okay, Louis.

48
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:53,681
究竟发生什么事了
What's really going on here?

49
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:56,889
不是因为塔拉
It's not about Tara.

50
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:02,625
是孩子
It's--It's about the baby.

51
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:07,282
我担心我永远做不了父亲
I'm just worried I'll never be a father.

52
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:16,314
我觉得下周我们正好可以从这里讲起
I think that's a good place for us to pick up next week.

53
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:17,234
-搞什么  -路易  冷静
- What the fu--? - Louis, calm down.

54
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:19,474
不  我刚把我最深的恐惧告诉了你
No, I just told you my deepest fear

55
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:20,619
那就是我的时间不多了
is that my clock is running out,

56
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,146
而你只在乎你的宝贝时间
and all you care about is your precious time?

57
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:25,404
你有没有想过  你没有时限
Has it ever occurred to you that you don't have a clock

58
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:27,892
你什么时候都能要孩子
and can have children whenever you want?

59
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,266
你好意思说这种屁话
Well, that sounds like a load of crap coming from a guy

60
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,546
你还在看表呢
who's looking at his clock.

61
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:33,343
你的偶像托尼・兰道尔呢
What about your idol, Tony Randall?

62
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,336
天呐
Oh, my God.

63
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:41,802
托尼・兰道尔第一个孩子是他77岁时出生的
Tony Randall fathered his first child at 77.

64
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,527
医生  这太棒了
Doc, this is fantastic.

65
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:45,322
所以  下周前你没问题了
So you're good till next week.

66
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:46,606
你疯了吗  我都要崩溃了
What, are you nuts? I'm teetering.

67
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:48,269
取消明天一下午的预约
Clear up tomorrow, all afternoon.

68
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,132
我当时在单位
I was at work.

69
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,059
孩子的日托所打来
It was the kids' daycare calling.

70
00:04:56,487 --> 00:04:57,875
香农没去
Shannon never showed up.

71
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,379
然后呢
And then what happened?

72
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:03,304
然后警方来电话了  我的世界终结了
Then the police called. My world ended.

73
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:04,338
一个月后
And one month later,

74
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,762
我收到了保险公司的来信
I got a letter from the insurance company

75
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:08,863
说香农在申请时撒谎了
saying Shannon lied on her application.

76
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,007
关于什么
About what?

77
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:12,543
他们说她吸烟
They're claiming she was a smoker.

78
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:15,963
-是这样吗  -不  她五年前就戒了
- Was she? - No, she quit five years ago,

79
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:17,362
而且这事她早说了
and she was totally up-front about it.

80
00:05:17,363 --> 00:05:19,651
那他们为什么认为她申请时撒谎了
So then why would they think she lied on her application?

81
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:22,427
因为这个
Because of this.

82
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:27,150
这是香农在她亲戚婚礼上的照片
It's a picture of Shannon at her cousin's wedding.

83
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:29,243
他们跟索赔拒付信一起寄来的
They sent it to me along with her denied claim.

84
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,925
请告诉我这照片是五年前的了
Please tell me this picture is over five years old.

85
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:33,918
是八个月前的
It was taken eight months ago.

86
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:36,382
他们肯定是看了她的脸书主页
They must've gone into her Facebook page.

87
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,347
该死
Shit.

88
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,958
就那么一根烟  我还狠狠地说她了
It was one cigarette, and I gave her hell for it.

89
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,102
那无所谓  不论是一根还是一百根
It doesn't matter if it was one or a hundred,

90
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:44,614
他们足以凭此称她的保单无效
it's enough for them to claim her policy is null and void.

91
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,980
我妻子死于了车祸  罗斯先生
My wife died in a car accident, Mr. Ross.

92
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:50,267
她是个健康的39岁女人
She was a healthy 39-year-old woman.

93
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:53,291
她因为赶着下班接孩子而死
She died rushing from her job to pick up our children.

94
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,246
这跟抽烟有什么关系
What the hell does any of this have to do with smoking?

95
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:58,139
是不该有任何关系
It shouldn't have anything to do with it,

96
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:00,971
但是这家公司的使命不是帮助他人
but this company is not in the business of helping people.

97
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:02,947
而是挣钱
It's in the business of making money.

98
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:06,047
如果他们能找到理由拒付
So if they can find any reason not to honor a claim,

99
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:07,238
他们就会抓住机会
they'll take it.

100
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,743
没有保险的赔付  我们会失去房子
Without that insurance money, we're gonna lose our home.

101
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,425
求你  我的孩子已经失去够多了
Please--my children have lost enough.

102
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:22,393
我会想办法的
I'll find a way.

103
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,707
看到钱  就愿意留下吃饭*
*See the money, wanna stay for your meal

104
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:32,076
给你太太再拿块馅饼*
*Get another piece of pie for your wife

105
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,443
所有人都想知道那感觉*
*Everybody wanna know how it feel

106
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,630
所有人都想见见那景象*
*Everybody wanna see what it's like

107
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,059
豆子馅饼我也愿吃  我不在乎*
*I'll even eat a bean pie, I don't mind

108
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:46,016
我和妹子忙着赚钱*
*Me and Missy is so busy, busy making money

109
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:47,101
好了*
*All right

110
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:52,149
退开点  我要跳舞*
*All step back, I'm 'bout to dance

111
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,961
诉讼双雄
第七季  第二集

112
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:55,116
美钞爵士摇摇摇*
*The greenback boogie

113
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:03,140
我不知道有人搬进来了
I didn't know anybody was moving in here.

114
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:04,139
看起来不错
It looks great.

115
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,180
当一切尘埃落定  我们将会请一个新合伙人
Well, as it turns out, we're getting ourselves a new partner,

116
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:08,868
他们也需要一个新办公室所以
and they needed a new office, so.

117
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:10,820
新合伙人  太棒了
New partner? That's fantastic.

118
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,266
说明我们已经重新站稳了
Shows we're back on our feet.

119
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:13,469
他们是那家律所来的
What firm are they from?

120
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,977
-这家  -没听懂
- This one. - I don't understand.

121
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:17,924
只是因为他们还没宣布罢了
That's 'cause it hasn't been announced yet,

122
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:20,148
不过你现在正注视着皮尔逊-
but you're looking at the newest senior partner

123
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,569
斯佩克特-利特的新高级合伙人
at Pearson Specter Litt.

124
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:26,038
恭喜你唐娜  你一定很开心
 Congratulations, Donna. You must be thrilled.

125
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,051
我是很开心
I am.

126
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:29,470
我也知道你现在在想什么
And I know what you're thinking--

127
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:31,497
一个小秘书怎么能当合伙人呢  但
how can a secretary be made a partner? But--

128
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,199
我不会这么想的唐娜
I wasn't thinking that, Donna.

129
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:34,848
我知道你工作有多努力
I know how hard you work

130
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:37,909
也知道你对这间公司和这里的每个人意味深重
and how much you mean to this firm and everyone in it.

131
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:39,549
谢谢你  卡特里娜
Thanks, Katrina.

132
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,197
不客气  你忙吧
You're welcome. I'll let you get back to work.

133
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:50,128
我只是说你太操之过急了
All I'm saying is I think you're rushing it.

134
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:52,572
而且  当你推翻了一个独裁者之后
And I'm saying that, when you overthrow a dictator,

135
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,644
你不应该还把他们的雕像留在广场上
you don't leave their statue up in the square.

136
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:56,428
你应该连雕像都清除
You tear it the hell down.

137
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:58,504
你不认为这么说其实是告诉了大家
You don't think that this sends a message

138
00:07:58,505 --> 00:08:00,208
你还需要证明你自己吗
that you have something to prove?

139
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,653
哈维  你还记得阿瑟・里夫斯不
Harvey, do you remember Arthur Reeves?

140
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:06,136
你说扮演超人的那个演员
You mean the guy who played Superman?

141
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:07,304
那是乔治・里夫斯
That was George Reeves.

142
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:09,365
阿瑟・里夫斯创建了这家律所
Arthur Reeves founded this firm.

143
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:12,296
当高登  斯密特和范・戴克把他驱逐出城时
And when Gordon, Schimdt, and Van Dyke ran him out of town,

144
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:14,657
他们不单单只是把他墙上的名字拿掉
they didn't just tear his name off the wall.

145
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:16,234
还打给他最大的客户滚蛋
They called his biggest client

146
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:19,311
自己找个新律所
and told them to pack up their shit and find another firm.

147
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:21,191
你想说什么
What's your point?

148
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:23,619
我想表达他们希望大家都知道
My point is they wanted the world to know

149
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,287
新掌门人来了
there was a new sheriff in town,

150
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,224
这行为传达的不是你需要证明自己
and the message that sends isn't that you have something to prove--

151
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:29,645
而是你已经掌控一切了
it's that you're in charge.

152
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:33,854
而且会继续掌控下去
And you're staying that way.

153
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:47,272
皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特

154
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:59,373
希望你不要介意我擅自把它挂起来了
Hope you don't mind I took the liberty of hanging that.

155
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:03,828
我猜猜  是你作为我秘书的最后一个剪影
Let me guess-- it's your last official act as my secretary.

156
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:06,685
我以前告诉过你我不会丢下你不管的
I told you once before I wouldn't leave you high and dry.

157
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:09,277
谢谢你  唐娜
Thanks, Donna.

158
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:10,456
不客气  哈维
You're welcome, Harvey.

159
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:15,217
说到不再是你秘书这件事
And speaking of not being your secretary anymore...

160
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:20,440
这是宣布我当合伙人的新闻稿
This is a press release announcing my partnership.

161
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:22,065
它不单单只是一个新闻稿
It's more than just a press release.

162
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:24,158
它是给整个世界的宣言
It's a statement to the world.

163
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,453
放着好了我等下会看
I'll take a look at it later.

164
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:31,318
你是指下午看还是
Do you mean, like, later this afternoon

165
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,763
等你去看阿加德医生之后
or later, like, after you go see Dr. Agard?

166
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:37,934
-什么  -哈维  上次我不想当你秘书时
- What? - Harvey, the last time I stopped being your secretary,

167
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:39,632
你就整个慌掉了
you started having panic attacks,

168
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,273
我不是说你这次会重蹈覆辙
and I'm not saying that's gonna happen again,

169
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:42,835
然而你的表情刚刚暴露了
but you just got a look on your face,

170
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:44,699
而且我想确保这一切你是支持的
and I wanna make sure you're okay with all of this.

171
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,200
我没意见的  唐娜
I'm okay with it, Donna.

172
00:09:46,348 --> 00:09:48,139
我会打点好你所有需要发布新闻稿的一切
I'll get you what you need to issue that release,

173
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,321
但现在  我要先搞定我自己那份
but, right now, I gotta make a statement of my own.

174
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:58,391
有什么能够帮到你呢  罗斯先生
What can I do for you, Mr. Ross?

175
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:00,927
不如从给哈利・克里斯特开支票开始
Well, you can start by writing a check to Harry Kirst.

176
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:03,039
-你不是来浪费时间的吧  -不是的  
- You don't waste time, do you? - No, I don't.

177
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,113
那不如你给我客户30万
So why don't you cut my client a check for $300,000,

178
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:09,070
然后我撤回尚未上诉的案件
and I'll withdraw this lawsuit I haven't filed yet.

179
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:13,339
罗斯先生  恐怕你有一些理解失误
Mr. Ross, I'm afraid there's been a little misunderstanding here.

180
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,427
我们没想要庭外和解
We're not looking to settle.

181
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:16,144
那你约我开什么会
Then why the hell did you set this meeting?

182
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,531
程序所需  我们需要和客户见面
Cause it's policy to meet with our clients

183
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:20,067
为解决他们的问题作出尝试
and try to resolve their issues.

184
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:22,771
好  我客户的问题是你们不遵守和他的合同
Okay, well, my client's issue is you're not honoring his claim

185
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:24,011
导致他无法继续抚养小孩
so he can't support his children.

186
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:25,203
对此我感到非常抱歉
Yes, and I'm very sorry about that,

187
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:26,673
然而我无能为力
but my hands are tied.

188
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:30,128
我懂
I get it.

189
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,755
你们的政策就会推诿责任
Your policy is to give people the runaround

190
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:34,626
令他们大受打击然后撤诉
so they get demoralized and drop their case.

191
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:37,695
不  罗斯先生  我们的政策是照章办事
No, Mr. Ross, our policy is to follow the letter of our contracts,

192
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:40,205
如果我们让一个客户在申请表上撒谎
and, if we let one person who lied on their application

193
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,181
而毫发无损地拿赔偿的话
get away with it,

194
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,589
我们不用做生意了
we wouldn't have a business anymore.

195
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,634
看着我
Look at me.

196
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,501
我不是什么民事人身伤害小律师好吧
I'm not some personal injury lawyer, all right?

197
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:47,797
我是皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特律所的
I work at Pearson Specter Litt.

198
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:49,130
我不会善罢甘休的
I'm not gonna get worn down.

199
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:52,315
所以我建议你们赔钱了事
So I suggest you just cut me a check.

200
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,634
你们也无需在公堂上被我弄得颜面无光
Save yourself the trouble of me wiping the floor with you in court.

201
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,487
我说过了  我无能为力
As I said, my hands are tied,

202
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:01,320
但是我不会是和你对簿公堂的那个
but it won't be me you'll be going up against in court.

203
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:03,621
外聘律师阿克曼先生才是和你打擂台的
It'll be our outside counsel, Mr. Ackerman.

204
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:05,412
而且就我所知
And, from what I've seen,

205
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:08,340
没有人不会在阿克曼先生面前败下阵来
nobody wipes the floor with Mr. Ackerman.

206
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:15,808
你的办公室不错啊
Nice office.

207
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,312
不过我的更好
Mine's better.

208
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:19,289
你不是用过这句台词了
Isn't that the same line you used

209
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,231
在你觉得你的法拉利比我的眼镜蛇好的时候
when you thought your Ferrari was better than my Cobra?

210
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:22,324
它确实比较好啊
It was better.

211
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:24,271
而且好台词总不会过时的
And a good line never gets old.

212
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,514
怎么不和你日渐高耸发际线说
Tell that to your hairline.

213
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:26,845
怎么不和你日渐松弛的腰际线说
Tell that to your waistline.

214
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:30,000
好久不见  哈维
Good to see you, Harvey.

215
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:31,132
什么风把你吹过来了
What brings you down?

216
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:34,240
想和你结束掉我们几年前开始过的对话
I'm here to finish a conversation we started years ago.

217
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,699
我知道你不会来这里工作
Well, I know you're not coming over here,

218
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,795
那你一定是想说让我到你那边去了
so you must be talking about me working over there.

219
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:39,626
若我正有此意呢
What if I am?

220
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:41,347
我会问"你想要我的哪一个客户"
I'd say "Which one of my clients are you after?"

221
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:43,227
因为我们都清楚你不能把辉瑞制药拿走
because we both know you can't have Pfizer.

222
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:44,272
不  我可以
Yes, I can.

223
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,019
你的意思是你为了挖我
Are you telling me you're ready to drop

224
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,067
而准备放弃掉杰西卡最早的客户吗
Jessica's oldest client just to get me?

225
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:50,392
我就是这个意思
That's what I'm telling you.

226
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:52,954
为什么现在出手
Why now?

227
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:56,080
因为杰西卡走了  所以如今我能够这么做了
Because Jessica's gone, so now I can.

228
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,451
-那你得让我当冠名合伙人  -什么
- Then make me name partner. - What?

229
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,675
这事不在于杰西卡走了所以你有权力了
This isn't about Jessica's gone so now you can--

230
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:04,938
而是在于杰西卡走了
this is about Jessica's gone,

231
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:07,156
所以如今你想告诉全世界你不是她
so now you wanna tell the world that you're not her.

232
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:08,845
而且你的重点也不是挖我
And that's not about hiring me.

233
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:10,173
而是想要我的客户
That's about getting my client.

234
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:11,741
亚历克斯  这是双赢
Alex, this is a win/win.

235
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:13,684
我不偷偷挖你墙角  你过来  你我都开心
I don't poach. You come over. We have fun.

236
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:15,595
但我不会就这么轻易让你掌控我的地盘的
But I'm not gonna just give you the run of the place.

237
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:16,555
那我就不去了
Then I'm not coming.

238
00:12:16,556 --> 00:12:18,936
因为一年之内我的名字就能上这里的墙
Because my name is going up on this wall within a year.

239
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:20,696
而辉瑞制药也不会离开我
And Pfizer's not leaving me.

240
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:23,216
-亚历克斯...  -你总说你牌技比我好
- Alex-- - You always say you're the better poker player.

241
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:24,391
但今天可不是这种情况
Well, not today,

242
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:26,619
因为我赌注全下了  而你手里根本没牌
because I'm all in, and you got nothing.

243
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:29,002
所以要么让我当冠名合伙人
So either add my name to your letterhead

244
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,611
不然就带着你的筹码回家吧
or take your chips and go home.

245
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,442
法官大人  随他们如何狡辩
Your Honor, they can dress this up all they want,

246
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:40,085
但事实就是死者签订合同时主观有恶意
but the fact is the deceased entered into a contract in bad faith

247
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:41,997
她慌称自己不再吸烟了
by claiming she was no longer a smoker.

248
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:44,504
场上唯一的事实就是他们捏造了一个理由
The only fact here is that they're manufacturing a reason

249
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:46,141
来逃避合理的索赔
to weasel out of a legitimate claim.

250
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:48,029
你是在向庭上声称我们捏造了这张
Are you gonna tell the court that we manufactured

251
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,742
你客户在八个月之前吸烟的照片吗
this picture of your client smoking eight months ago?

252
00:12:50,743 --> 00:12:53,807
我十分清楚你们送给那位悲伤的丈夫的照片
I'm well aware of the photo that you sent a grieving husband,

253
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:55,887
但一张并没有显示该女子在吸烟的照片
but an image of a woman not inhaling a cigarette

254
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:56,759
并不能说明什么
doesn't prove anything.

255
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,719
她在申请的时候撒谎了
She lied on her application.

256
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,543
这和她的死因毫无关系
Which had nothing to do with how she died.

257
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:02,071
但她的死因并非我们的诉讼焦点
And manner of death isn't at issue here.

258
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,260
-合同才是  -他说得有道理
- The contract is. - He's got a point.

259
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:05,761
法官大人  他们声称我的客户
Your Honor, they're claiming that my client

260
00:13:05,762 --> 00:13:07,686
签订合同时主观上有恶意
entered into a policy in bad faith.

261
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,153
那当一家公司翻遍了一名女子的社交媒体记录
Well, what kind of faith is it when a company

262
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:12,409
只为了欺负她的丈夫和三个孩子时
pores through a woman's social media history

263
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,129
他们算是想打什么主意
just to stick it to her grieving husband and three children?

264
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,137
总比一个在过去三年里
Better faith than a man that pretended to be an attorney

265
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:18,726
假冒律师的人强
for the better part of three years.

266
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:20,625
这话什么意思
What are you talking about?

267
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:23,430
法官大人  这是罗斯先生的哈佛学位证
Your Honor, this is Mr. Ross' Harvard diploma.

268
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:28,070
问题是罗斯先生根本就没上过哈佛
The only problem is Mr. Ross never actually went to Harvard.

269
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:31,969
他倒是在丹伯里联邦监狱待过
The only place he did graduate from was Danbury Federal Prison

270
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,857
服刑原因就是冒充律师
where he spent time for impersonating a lawyer.

271
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:37,249
够了  这完全是无用且无关的信息
All right, that is inadmissible and irrelevant.

272
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,956
你说我们恶意  你的整个人生都充满恶意
You're claiming bad faith. Your whole life is bad faith.

273
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:41,341
我觉得陪审团应该了解这一点
I think a jury should have a chance to hear that.

274
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:41,943
法官大人  这简直...
Your Honor, this--

275
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:45,007
我拒绝你驳回诉讼的请求  阿克曼先生
Your motion to dismiss is denied, Mr. Ackerman,

276
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:48,383
但是  罗斯先生  我倾向于认为
but, Mr. Ross, I am inclined to agree

277
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:51,319
你的过往和本案相关  这就意味着
that your history is relevant to this case, which means,

278
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,343
假如他想把这点拿到庭审上去说
if he wants to bring it up at trial,

279
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:54,788
我是不会制止他的
I'm not stopping him.

280
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:58,271
你就是打算玩这招吗
So that's how you're gonna play it?

281
00:13:58,536 --> 00:13:59,440
什么
Excuse me?

282
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:00,842
你现在不打算告诉我
You're not gonna give me

283
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:02,434
你们实际能出的和解费吗
your real settlement offer right now?

284
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:04,452
我完全不明白你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

285
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,462
放屁  我就知道那女的之前没给我报价
Bullshit--I knew there was a reason that woman

286
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:07,679
是有原因的
didn't give me an offer before.

287
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,600
现在我明白了  是因为你想让我目睹那一幕
Now I know it's because you wanted me to see that.

288
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:11,603
既然你提到这个  我确实利用职权
Now that you mention it, I did take the liberty

289
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:13,544
设定了一个小小的和解条件
of whipping up a little standard boilerplate.

290
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:16,256
不承认过错  你们就能获得一点点和解费
No admission of guilt, you settle for pennies on the dollar,

291
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:17,246
一口价
and that's take it or leave it.

292
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:19,198
那我现在就告诉你  我们不接受
Well, then let me tell you right now we're leaving it.

293
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,222
你有义务把我们的报价告知你的客户
You're required to present this to your client.

294
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:23,540
我也有义务向他们提供法律意见
Well, I'm also required to give them my legal opinion,

295
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,587
告诉他们你们败诉后给的钱会比这多得多
which is that you stand to lose a lot more than that.

296
00:14:25,588 --> 00:14:27,747
也许你没注意到刚刚在里面发生了什么
Maybe you missed what just went on back there.

297
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:30,628
刚刚在里面法官支持了我的诉讼请求
What went on back there is the judge ruled in my favor,

298
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,135
而你没能成功地驳回诉讼
and you didn't get your case dismissed.

299
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:33,957
同时他也表态了
He also showed his hand.

300
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,442
当12名陪审团成员发现审理此案的人
Now, how do you think 12 jurors are gonna rule

301
00:14:35,443 --> 00:14:38,052
显然根本都不信任你时
when it's plain as day that the guy hearing the case

302
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:39,655
你觉得他们会如何判
doesn't even trust you?

303
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:52,493
-很好  你们都到了  -当然了
- Good, you're here. - Of course we are.

304
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:54,048
管理合伙人召开会议
When the managing partner calls a meeting,

305
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:55,488
所有合伙人都得出席
the rest of the partners show up.

306
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:56,709
你想和我们谈些什么
So what'd you want to talk about?

307
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:00,007
我想谈谈把辉瑞制药拉来当我们的客户的事
I wanna talk about bringing on Pfizer as a client.

308
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,401
哈维  我相信你清楚这一点
Harvey, I'm sure you already know this--

309
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:02,863
那样意味着放弃吉姆・雷诺兹
that would mean dropping Jim Reynolds.

310
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:03,980
我想这就是重点
I think that's the point,

311
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:05,262
而且我觉得这个主意棒极了  哈维
and I think it's a great idea, Harvey.

312
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:07,015
辉瑞制药的规模是吉姆・雷诺兹的十倍
Pfizer's ten times the size of Jim Reynolds,

313
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:08,463
但杰西卡在这件事上一直很固执
and Jessica's always been stubborn about him.

314
00:15:08,464 --> 00:15:09,979
那就好  因为要想达成这个目的
Good, because, in order to do that,

315
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,227
我们得让亚历克斯・威廉姆斯当冠名合伙人
we need to make Alex Williams a name partner.

316
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:16,000
-什么  -你以为把辉瑞制药拉过来的人是谁
- What? - Who do you think's bringing Pfizer over here in the first place?

317
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,340
那就给他一件有无敌风景的大办公室啊
So then give him a corner office with a killer view

318
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:20,538
因为我是不会让一个我都不怎么认识的人
because I'm not gonna do something like that

319
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:22,226
-当冠名合伙人的  -哈维...
- for someone I barely know. - Harvey--

320
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:23,689
我和他认识了15年了
Well, I've known him for 15 years,

321
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,835
我为他作担保
and I'm vouching for him.

322
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:26,484
就算你和他是一个娘胎里出来的
I don't care if you came out of the womb with him.

323
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,777
你不能为了拉到一个客户
You don't just slap somebody's name

324
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:29,029
就随便把某个人的名字拍上墙
on the wall to get a client.

325
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,099
我不仅仅是把他的名字拍上墙  路易
I'm not just slapping his name up, Louis.

326
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,958
我在做正式动议
I'm making a move.

327
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,285
-哈维...  -够了
- Harvey-- - Hey, that's enough.

328
00:15:33,286 --> 00:15:36,473
我昨晚问了你们对我当老大有没有意见
I asked you last night if you had any problems with me calling the shots,

329
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:37,293
你们说没有
and you said you didn't.

330
00:15:37,294 --> 00:15:39,456
你到底同不同意
Now, are you on board with this or not?

331
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:43,221
好吧  哈维  我同意
Okay, Harvey, I'm on board.

332
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,112
终于找到你了  我需要你帮忙
Ah, there you are. I need your help.

333
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,490
在我安安静静地吃完我的火腿三明治后
And you can have it after I've enjoyed

334
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:56,129
我就可以帮你的忙了
my ham sandwich in peace.

335
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,902
不行  不好意思  你得等等再吃了
Nope, sorry, that ham's gonna have to wait.

336
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:00,132
哈维要让某个陌生人当冠名合伙人了
Harvey is about to make some stranger name partner.

337
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:03,196
什么  路易  你一定是搞错了
What? Louis, you must've misunderstood something.

338
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:06,357
格蕾琴  我听得真真切切
Gretchen, I heard him clear as a frickin' bell.

339
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:08,785
他想要这家伙的一个客户  冠名合伙人
He wants one of the guy's clients, name partnership

340
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:10,930
则是代价  我认为这是个天大的错误
is the price, and I think it's a huge mistake.

341
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:13,224
-那你有那么告诉他吗  -当然说了
- Well, did you tell him that? - Yes, of course,

342
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:14,124
但是他听不进去
but he couldn't hear me.

343
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,129
我昨晚告诉他我会支持他的决定的
And I told him last night that I would back his decisions.

344
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,572
也就是说你想让我去尽可能多的
Which means you want me to find out as much dirt

345
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:21,321
找到那个人的黑料  这样你就可以说服哈维
as I can on the sucker so you can convince Harvey

346
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:22,188
不要雇佣他
not to hire him.

347
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,301
正是这样  所以请你赶紧出手
Exactly, so let's move this little piggy to the market

348
00:16:24,302 --> 00:16:25,829
-去...  -那是不可能的  路易
- and go-- - Not gonna happen, Louis.

349
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,292
格蕾琴  你没有听到我刚刚说的吗
Gretchen, did you not hear what I just said?

350
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:29,335
我听到了  你没听过
I heard you. Have you never heard the saying

351
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:31,002
"要剥猫皮  不只一法"的说法吗
"There's more than one way to skin a cat"?

352
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,342
你是说"要喂饱猫"吧
You mean "Stuff a cat."

353
00:16:32,343 --> 00:16:34,168
我为什么要说"要喂饱猫"
Why would I mean "Stuff a cat"?

354
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:35,721
因为他们是美好的生物
Because they are glorious creatures,

355
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:37,387
只有野蛮人才会剥猫的皮
and only a barbarian would skin one.

356
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:40,084
路易  你的思考方式不对
Louis, your brain is not right.

357
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:43,638
我的意思是  如果哈维想要这个人的客户
My point is, if Harvey wants this man's client,

358
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,874
一定还有别的办法可以得到他们
there has to be another way to get them.

359
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:47,785
天啊  你说得对
Holy shit. You're right.

360
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,961
如果我能拉到辉瑞这个客户  哈维甚至根本
If I can get Pfizer, Harvey doesn't even have to bring

361
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:53,678
都不用把这个小丑招到公司里了
this clown to the firm at all.

362
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,991
系上安全带  格蕾琴  因为我们要
Strap in, Gretchen, because we're about to get

363
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:58,667
撸起袖子  把这只猫喂到吐
elbow-deep into stuffing the shit out of this cat.

364
00:16:58,827 --> 00:16:59,797
我走了[没法吃了]
And I'm out.

365
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,068
我不明白
I don't understand.

366
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,829
我是说  我知道这个报价很糟糕
I mean, I get that the offer is horrible,

367
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:10,771
但是如果法官允许这案子上庭
but if the judge is letting this thing go to trial,

368
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:12,716
他一定认为我是有案可立的
he must think I have a case.

369
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:14,213
的确是这样  哈利
You do have a case, Harry.

370
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:17,991
但是对方律师很明确
But the lawyer on the other side of this thing has made it clear

371
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:19,946
他会使尽浑身解数
that he is willing to pull out all of the stops,

372
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:21,275
无论多么低级
no matter how low.

373
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:22,539
他们已经用了香农的照片
They already used the photo of Shannon.

374
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,760
他们还有什么
What else do they have?

375
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:28,560
-我  -什么意思
- Me. - What are you talking about?

376
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:31,177
我现在是个完全获得许可的律师协会的一员
Look, I am a fully-licensed member of the bar now,

377
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:33,440
但是在这之前  我...
but, before I was, I--

378
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,738
我是无证上岗  并且被逮到了
I was practicing law without a license, and I got caught.

379
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:38,934
你不觉得应该告诉我吗
And you didn't think I should know that?

380
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:40,366
我不认为那和案子有关
I didn't think that it would be relevant.

381
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,760
现在看来是肯定有关了
It sure as hell seems relevant.

382
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,119
他们只是想要陪审团对我产生偏见
They are just trying to prejudice the jury against me--

383
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,121
他们想要陪审团对你产生偏见  反正我会
They're going to be prejudiced against you--I'd be.

384
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:47,192
我还是可以赢下这个案子的
I'm telling you that I can still win this.

385
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:49,492
还是可以赢  他们要让这案子看起来像是
Still win? They're gonna make it seem like

386
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:51,404
香农故意撒谎  之后我去
Shannon lied on purpose, and then I went out

387
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,525
雇了个骗子来掩饰
and hired a liar to cover it up.

388
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,382
如果你想把案子交给别人
If you want someone else to handle this,

389
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:03,803
我完全理解
I... completely understand.

390
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:08,008
唯一的问题是  在我找你之前
The only problem with that is I went to 15 firms

391
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:09,500
我去了15家律所
before I came to you,

392
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:14,120
因为那张照片  没有一家愿意接我的案子
and none of them would take my case because of that photo.

393
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,604
你是我最后的希望了  罗斯先生
You were my last hope, Mr. Ross,

394
00:18:19,027 --> 00:18:20,944
现在你告诉我我们要输了
and now you're telling me we're gonna lose.

395
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:22,745
不  哈利
No, Harry.

396
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:28,384
我向你保证  我不会让你输掉这个案子的
I am promising you that I will not cost you this case.

397
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:33,290
很好  唐娜  你在这
Good, Donna, you're here.

398
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,172
需要有人来起草亚历克斯的合同
I'm gonna need someone to draw up a contract for Alex, and--

399
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:37,429
哈维  我觉得我们不应该放弃吉姆・雷诺兹
Harvey, I don't think we should drop Jim Reynolds.

400
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,012
-什么  -我理解你在做什么
- What? - I understand what you're doing,

401
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:40,792
但是我觉得也许你有点太着急了
but I think that maybe you're rushing into it.

402
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:43,181
我不着急  唐娜  我只是很果断
I'm not rushing, Donna. I'm being decisive.

403
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,303
那么在你这么做之前你得告诉杰西卡
Then you need to tell Jessica before you do it.

404
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:47,562
告诉杰西卡
Tell Jessica?

405
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:50,994
我这么做是为了宣布现在这是我的律所了
I'm doing this to show people that this is my firm now.

406
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:53,346
寻求妈咪的许可并不在计划之中
Asking Mommy's permission isn't part of the plan.

407
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:54,739
那么向你剩下的长期委托人
Well, is it also part of the plan

408
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,765
发出如果遇到更大的委托人
that you signal to the rest

409
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:56,877
你就会弃他们不顾的信号
of our long-term clients

410
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:58,790
也在计划之中吗
that you'll just throw them over for the next big thing?

411
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,937
你到底怎么了
Where the hell is this coming from?

412
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,378
什么叫"你到底怎么了"
What do you mean "Where is this coming from?"

413
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:03,878
你让我当合伙人  我在说我的看法  
You made me a partner. I'm saying my piece.

414
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,202
那是开会的作用
That's what the meeting was for.

415
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,930
也许你没发现  但是你和路易
Well, maybe you didn't notice, but you and Louis were having

416
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:09,954
-是在单独会谈  -你知道吗  唐娜
- a private meeting. - Well, you know what, Donna?

417
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:11,889
你有胆量要上桌的资格
You had the balls to ask for a seat at the table.

418
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,846
那下一次你有什么要说的
So the next time you have something to say,

419
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:16,327
有胆量在会议中说出来
have the balls to say it at the goddamn meeting.

420
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,697
今天在庭上怎么样
How'd it go in court?

421
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,286
不怎么样
Not great.

422
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:36,296
不会吧  别告诉我法官同意撤销这个案子
No, don't tell me the judge agreed to dismiss the case.

423
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,461
对方律师不知怎么搞到了
The lawyer on the other side somehow got a copy

424
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:41,906
-我假文凭的副本  -迈克  那就是胡说
- of my fake diploma. - Mike, that's bullshit.

425
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:44,027
你的过往和这个案子没有任何关系
Your history has nothing to do with this case.

426
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:46,745
我知道  但是他让法官向着他那边了
I know that, but he got the judge on his side,

427
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:48,818
他也会试着对陪审团故技重施
and he's gonna try and do the same thing with the jury,

428
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:50,801
我的委托人也不太相信我
and my own client barely trusts me.

429
00:19:50,802 --> 00:19:53,680
好吧  你准备怎么做
Okay, what are you gonna do?

430
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:57,401
我想你能不能为我接手这个案子
I was wondering if you would take over the case for me.

431
00:19:58,637 --> 00:20:01,674
如果你想这么做的话  我很荣幸
If that's what you want, then I would be honored to.

432
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:12,595
亚历克斯  很高兴你能打电话来
Alex, I'm glad you called.

433
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:14,192
我们还在做文书工作
We're still working out the paperwork--

434
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:15,311
如果你们还在做文书工作
If you're still working on the paperwork,

435
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:17,612
为什么我刚发现你们在挖我的客户
how come I just found out you're trying to poach my client?

436
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:19,653
-什么  -别跟我打哈哈
- What? - Don't bullshit me.

437
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:21,619
凯文・鲍尔告诉我皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特
Kevin Bauer told me that PSL called

438
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,343
打电话预约见面
to set an appointment,

439
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,253
当然不是告诉我的客户
and it sure as hell wasn't to tell my own client

440
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:26,232
我要去你的律所当冠名合伙人了
that I'm going to be name partner at your firm.

441
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:28,341
该死
God damn it.

442
00:20:28,342 --> 00:20:29,781
你是说你和这件事没有关系吗
You're telling me you had nothing to do with this?

443
00:20:29,782 --> 00:20:31,356
我就是这个意思
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

444
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:32,777
那你最好想点办法
Then get your shit together

445
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,531
这件事成不成都行
and either make this thing happen or not

446
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:36,398
但我之前为你担过一次风险
'cause I went out on a limb for you once before.

447
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:38,475
我不会让同样的事情再发生一次
I'm not about to let the same thing happen again.

448
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,966
你安排和辉瑞见面了
Did you set a meeting with Pfizer?

449
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:46,180
哈维  你不理解
Harvey, you don't understand.

450
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:48,459
我的理解是你一开始同意
What I understand is you were on board

451
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,465
把亚历克斯拉过来  接着你又去
with bringing Alex over, and then you tried

452
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:52,375
-偷他的客户  -不是这样的
- to poach his client. - It's not like that.

453
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,893
我知道你想要的是其实是辉瑞
I knew what you really wanted was Pfizer,

454
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:56,681
-所以我才想办成这件事  -不  路易
- so I tried to make it happen. - No, Louis, what I really

455
00:20:56,682 --> 00:20:59,675
我想要的是把我认识了十五年的
wanted was to bring over my friend who I've known

456
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,603
-朋友带过来  -是吗
- for the last 15 years. - Yeah?

457
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:02,955
那就不管你的朋友我怎么想了
Well, what about what this friend thinks?

458
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:04,147
我们已经讨论过这件事了
We already had that discussion,

459
00:21:04,148 --> 00:21:05,428
然后你又背着我做这样的事
and then you went behind my back.

460
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:08,376
那也许是因为你提议任命你朋友
Maybe because it was stupid of you to offer your friend

461
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:10,863
-来做合伙人很愚蠢  -你说什么
- name partner in the first place. - Excuse me?

462
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:13,770
什么样的天才谈判人会一开始
What kind of genius negotiator gives away the house

463
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:15,256
-就放弃控制权  -路易...
- from the start? - Louis--

464
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:17,535
别说了  你想要辉瑞
No, you want Pfizer?

465
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:19,136
你去拿辉瑞
You go get Pfizer.

466
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:21,611
但是不要随便带进来什么新人
But don't you bring in some Johnny-come-lately

467
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:23,208
稀释公司的质量
and water down the name of this firm.

468
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,618
你才不在乎稀不稀释公司质量
You don't give a shit about watering down this firm.

469
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,318
你是怕自己被人挤下去
You're scared of watering down your place in it.

470
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,736
我才不怕什么三流律师
I'm not afraid of a third-rate lawyer.

471
00:21:29,737 --> 00:21:32,247
胡说  你不仅害怕  你还嫉妒
Bullshit, you're afraid and you're jealous.

472
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:34,069
-而且整间公司都知道  -现在没有必要
- And this entire firm knows it. - Now there's no need

473
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,966
嫉妒  因为他不会来了
to be jealous because he's not coming here.

474
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:37,670
他会来的
Yes, he is.

475
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,215
那你应该去读一下公司章程
Well, then why don't you try reading the by-laws?

476
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,427
因为要任命合伙人
Because in order to make someone name partner,

477
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:45,752
你需要我投票或者杰西卡投票  如果你以为
you need my vote or Jessica's vote, and if you think

478
00:21:45,753 --> 00:21:47,838
她会为了什么根本不认识的人
she is going to ditch her oldest client to bring in

479
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,236
抛下她最老的客户  那你才是疯了
someone she doesn't even know, you're out of your goddamn mind.

480
00:21:55,877 --> 00:21:57,162
哈维  能给我一分钟吗
Harvey, do you have a minute?

481
00:21:57,163 --> 00:21:58,555
我也就只有这么点时间了
That's about all I have.

482
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:02,103
好  我想问问能不能
Okay, I was wondering if it would be okay

483
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:04,253
让我接迈克的无偿服务案
if I took over Mike's pro bono case.

484
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,733
-什么  -出事了
- What? - Something came up.

485
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:09,163
他问我能不能接
He asked me if I could do it.

486
00:22:09,164 --> 00:22:12,560
-我  我想先征得你的同意  -不行
- I--I wanted to get your permission first. - No.

487
00:22:12,922 --> 00:22:13,921
为什么不行
Why not?

488
00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:16,546
因为和我达成协议的是迈克  不是你
Because I made a deal with Mike, not you.

489
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:19,196
现在你想告诉我到底怎么回事吗
Now, you wanna tell me what's really going on here?

490
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:20,455
因为除非迈克昏迷了
Because Mike's not giving away

491
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,733
否则绝不会放弃他的第一个案子
his first case unless he's in a coma.

492
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:26,305
对方律师说迈克是诈骗犯
The lawyer on the other side outed Mike as a fraud.

493
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:28,226
-什么意思  -他拿出了迈克的哈佛学位证
- Meaning? - He brought out Mike's Harvard diploma,

494
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:29,478
让法官对他产生了偏见
and he prejudiced the judge.

495
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:31,371
所以迈克认为如果他把案子推给你
So Mike thinks if he hands the case over to you,

496
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:32,800
对方律师就不能用这个武器了
he takes that weapon out of their hands.

497
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:34,780
-是的  -这下我是坚决不同意了
- Yes. - Well, now it's a definite no.

498
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:36,333
为什么就成坚决不同意了
Why does that make it a definite no?

499
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:37,583
因为这是我的决定
Because I said so.

500
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:38,959
哈维  你能至少和迈克谈谈吗
Harvey, can you at least talk to Mike?

501
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,175
不  我不能
No, I can't.

502
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:42,806
-为什么  -因为我要赶飞机
- Why not? - Because I got a plane to catch.

503
00:22:46,247 --> 00:22:47,228
你有事找我
You wanted to talk to me?

504
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:49,976
你从哪看出来的  九条短信还是十六条留言
What gave it away? The nine texts or the 16 messages?

505
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:51,153
我刚刚在飞机上
I was on a plane.

506
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:53,147
而我在你以前的办公室里思考
Yeah, well, I'm in your old office wondering why you even

507
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:54,620
如果你都不让我做简单人员安排
gave it to me if you're not gonna let me make

508
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:56,135
为什么还要把办公室给我
simple personnel decisions.

509
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:58,305
迈克  如果你让这个混蛋欺负了你
Mike, if you let this asshole bully you, you're gonna be

510
00:22:58,306 --> 00:22:59,880
那你以后见谁都得让步
backing down for the rest of your life.

511
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:02,666
我没有在让步  我是在争取时间
I'm not backing down. I am buying time

512
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:05,235
以避免以后再发生这种事
so that I can stop this bullshit from ever happening again.

513
00:23:05,372 --> 00:23:07,889
你不需要时间  我有办法
You don't need time. I have a way.

514
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,344
停止道歉  开始威胁
Stop apologizing and start intimidating.

515
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:11,826
标语很好  哈维
Well, that's a hell of a slogan, Harvey,

516
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:13,289
但这到底是什么意思
but what does it actually mean?

517
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,613
意思是你现在出去  找个记者
It means you go out, you find a reporter,

518
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,145
你说出你的故事
and you take control of the narrative.

519
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,710
成为一个赎罪的英雄
Instead of a lying fraud,

520
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:20,698
而不是撒谎的骗子
you're a hero fighting for redemption.

521
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,066
我现在没时间改变我的形象
I don't have time to change my image.

522
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:25,102
听着  如果我输了这个案子
Look, if I lose this case,

523
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,026
唯一写出来的文章会是
the only article that's gonna get written is that I never

524
00:23:27,027 --> 00:23:29,048
我一开始就不该做律师
should have been able to practice law in the first place.

525
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:31,559
如果你想不出不用瑞秋帮忙
Yeah, well, if you can't figure out a way to win

526
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,107
就能赢的办法  那也许我一开始
without Rachel's help, then maybe I shouldn't have

527
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:34,616
就不应该让你回来
brought you back in the first place

528
00:23:34,617 --> 00:23:38,034
因为我已经受够了我的每一位员工
because I've had about enough of having every employee

529
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:41,209
质疑我做的每一个决定
I have question every decision I make.

530
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:49,205
不是说餐厅见吗
I thought we were gonna meet at the restaurant.

531
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:51,051
我提前过来了
I got down here early.

532
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,066
曼哈顿没有这样的景色
Manhattan doesn't have views like this.

533
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:57,263
谢谢你腾出时间来见我  杰西卡
Thanks for making the time to see me, Jessica.

534
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,344
我永远会为你腾时间  哈维
I will always make time to see you, Harvey.

535
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:02,373
尤其是你都特意飞到这边来
Especially after you've flown all the way out here

536
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,049
-逼我就范了  -路易打电话给你了对吗
- to put the screws to me. - Louis called you, didn't he?

537
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,274
大概在你飞机起飞一小时后
About an hour after your plane took off.

538
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:08,897
那你已经听了他那个版本的故事了
Then you've already heard his side of the story--

539
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:10,523
我不需要听你的版本
And I don't need to hear yours.

540
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:13,034
-杰西卡  -哈维  我明白
- Jessica-- - Harvey, I understand

541
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,118
你想声明所有权  但你要仓促行事
wanting to make a statement, but, you rush into this,

542
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:18,728
你唯一能说明就是你还没准备好
the only statement you're making is that you're not ready.

543
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:20,152
我真不敢相信
I can't believe this.

544
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:22,349
这是我作为经营合伙人的
My first act as managing partner,

545
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,486
第一个决定  你却要来个釜底抽薪
and you're cutting my legs out from under me.

546
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:25,747
我不是要釜底抽薪
I'm not cutting anything out.

547
00:24:25,748 --> 00:24:28,329
我是想帮你  你不能把合伙人头衔
I'm trying to help you. You can't give out name partner

548
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,941
当万圣节糖果去发
like it's Halloween candy.

549
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:32,456
这听着不像要帮我  而是把我当孩子
That doesn't sound like help. That sounds like I'm a child--

550
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:35,246
哈维  如果你这次让步  下次
Harvey, you do this, what's gonna happen

551
00:24:35,247 --> 00:24:37,165
你再想带人过来会怎么样
the next time you wanna bring someone over?

552
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,127
我告诉你会怎么样  你会被迫就范
I'll tell you what happens-- you're going to get rolled

553
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,935
因为你没看清楚这件事
because you haven't thought this through.

554
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,398
你知道我怎么想吗
You know what I think?

555
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,955
我想这跟我做什么决定没关系
I think this has nothing to do with my decision.

556
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:48,662
是我为更大的客户抛弃你的客户让你生气
You're pissed I'm dumping your client for a better one.

557
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:51,906
不  哈维  你才会为这种事生气
No, Harvey, that's something you'd be pissed about

558
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,049
因为你从来就没有大局观念
because you've never been able to look at the big picture.

559
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,497
我告诉你我的大局观念
Well, how's this for big picture?

560
00:24:55,498 --> 00:24:56,984
那就是你想要鱼与熊掌兼得
I think you want it both ways.

561
00:24:56,985 --> 00:24:58,072
这话什么意思
And what the hell is that supposed to mean?

562
00:24:58,073 --> 00:24:59,664
意思是你既想待在这边
It means you want to live here

563
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,156
又想把名字留在我律所的墙上  因为
and keep your name on my wall because you're not ready

564
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:03,725
你还不愿放手我的律所
to let go of my firm.

565
00:25:03,992 --> 00:25:05,865
如果你真这么想
Well, if that's how you really feel,

566
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:08,859
那就把我的名字拆下来
then take my name off your goddamn wall,

567
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,424
然后爱干什么干什么
and then you can do whatever the hell you want.

568
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:31,824
你可别以为我忘了我们约好的晚餐
Hey, I hope you don't think I forgot about our dinner.

569
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:35,335
没有  只是我恐怕得换个时间
Yeah, I don't, but I'm afraid I have to reschedule.

570
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,613
好的  我随时都有空
Sure, any time is good for me.

571
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:39,373
谢谢你的理解
Thanks for being understanding.

572
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,530
而且我要说  我很期盼
And, for the record, I was really looking forward

573
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,371
我们能进一步加深了解
to getting to know each other better.

574
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:46,057
我也是
So was I.

575
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,248
但说实话  我很高兴我们换时间
But the truth is I guess I'm glad we're rescheduling.

576
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,833
我不想像上次那样
I didn't want to end up focusing on myself

577
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:53,415
只关注我自己的事
like I did the last time.

578
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:55,955
怎么  发生什么事了吗
Why, is something going on?

579
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,194
没什么
It's not a big deal.

580
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:59,197
哈维  你可以跟我说说
Harvey, you can talk to me about it.

581
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,995
-但你之前说过...  -我知道
- But you said before-- - I know what I said before,

582
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,565
-但这次不同  -怎么不同
- but this is different. - How?

583
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,417
因为接受了我的话  尊重了我的意愿
Because you heard me, and you respected my wishes,

584
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:09,735
说明我不再只是听你说话的心理医生了
which means instead of me listening to you as your therapist,

585
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,833
我愿意听你说话  作为你的...
you know, I'll be listening to you as your...

586
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:14,423
不是心理医生的人
Not therapist.

587
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:15,075
-是啊  -看看
- Yes. - Look at this,

588
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:20,759
虽然取消见面  我感觉反而更了解你一些了
even when we cancel, I feel like I'm getting to know you better.

589
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:22,048
我也是
Me too.

590
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:25,447
那你要告诉我出什么事了吗
So are you gonna tell me what's going on?

591
00:26:25,913 --> 00:26:27,088
其实
You know what?

592
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:30,520
我们这通电话后
Now that I just talked to you,

593
00:26:31,286 --> 00:26:33,474
我感觉我好像可以自己解决了
I feel like I can work it through myself.

594
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:34,425
很好
Good.

595
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:37,611
晚安  哈维
Good night, Harvey.

596
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:44,200
-忙吗  -你知道我很忙
- You busy? - You know I am, which means

597
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:46,479
所以如果没有要紧事  你也不会来找我
you wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.

598
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:49,178
没错  我跟哈维谈过了
You're right. I talked to Harvey.

599
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:53,234
-你让他回心转意了吗  -没有
- You changed his mind? - No, no.

600
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:56,397
他说如果我中途退缩  就会退缩一辈子 
He told me if I run from this, I'll be running forever.

601
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:58,922
虽然不想承认  但他说的有点道理
Look, I hate to say it, but he might have a point.

602
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:02,472
-的确  -那你怎么还来找我
- He does. - So then why are you here?

603
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:05,036
因为他让我想到  我在那见的第一个
'Cause he got me thinking. The woman I first met over there

604
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:07,783
女人说  他们不会让哈利和他的妻子这种人
said they couldn't let people like Harry and his wife get away

605
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:09,279
在申请表上撒谎这种事上得逞
with lying on their application

606
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,039
否则他们生意就没法做了
because they wouldn't have a business anymore.

607
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,849
没错  但是他们没在申请表上撒谎
Right, but they didn't lie on their application.

608
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,835
是  他们没有
No, they didn't.

609
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,483
但如果一家公司会这么想...
But a company that thinks like that...

610
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:20,871
也许也会想办法逃避索赔
Might have a policy of trying to not pay their claims at all.

611
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,097
正是如此
Exactly.

612
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:24,929
所以只要我们证明这家公司的真正政策
So if we can prove that that's the company's real policy,

613
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,632
那就赢定了
we got 'em.

614
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:27,633
但是  不管我们申请多少传票
But, right, Mike, we can get all the subpoenas in the world,

615
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:30,532
他们也不会乖乖交出证据啊
but they're never going to hand over a smoking gun like that.

616
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:31,663
他们是不会
No, they won't.

617
00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:34,579
但你认识一个不用传票就能帮我们
But I think you know someone who can get it for us

618
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,653
拿到证据的人
without issuing any subpoena at all.

619
00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:45,017
科伦维尔小姐  还记得我吗
Ms. Cromwell, remember me?

620
00:27:45,358 --> 00:27:48,641
很不幸还记得  失陪了
Yes, unfortunately. If you'll excuse me.

621
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:50,424
我们有份工作给你
We have a job we'd like to offer you.

622
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,642
-没兴趣  -你都没听是什么工作
- Not interested. - You haven't even heard what it is.

623
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:56,239
我没必要知道...
I don't need to know what it is--

624
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,766
我不跟信不过的人合作
I don't do business with people I don't trust.

625
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:01,112
-你是企业间谍  -不再是了...
- You're a corporate spy. - Not anymore--

626
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,881
因为她上次带过来的神秘人
'cause the last mystery man she brought me said word

627
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:05,007
保证说这件事不会传扬出去
wouldn't get out about our little arrangement.

628
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:08,813
但还是传出去了  所以现在我是正当猎头
Well, it did, so now I'm trying to make it as a legitimate headhunter,

629
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:11,449
挣的佣金只有以前的百分之十
which pays about 10% of what I made before,

630
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:13,914
失陪  我几分钟后我要见一位
so, if you'll excuse me, I'm meeting with

631
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:15,247
正经客户
an actual client in a few minutes.

632
00:28:15,248 --> 00:28:16,494
科伦维尔小姐  拜托了
Ms. Cromwell, please.

633
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,755
一位年仅39岁的年轻母亲车祸过世
A mother of three was killed in a car accident,

634
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:20,549
留下了三个孩子
and she was 39 years old.

635
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,969
她的丈夫没钱抚养
Now her husband can't support his children

636
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,818
因为聪明人保险公司企图拒绝赔付
because Acumen Insurance is trying to scam him out of their claim.

637
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,312
你们指望我做什么
What am I supposed to do about that?

638
00:28:27,313 --> 00:28:29,258
他们绝不是第一次这么做
This can't be the first time they've done this.

639
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,310
我们敢肯定纽约没什么大企业
And we're betting that there isn't a major corporation in this city

640
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,421
-是你弄不到消息的  -求你了
- that you don't have access to. - Please.

641
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,933
你可以帮助他们
You can help these people.

642
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:39,328
我才不想帮别人
I don't give a shit about helping people.

643
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:40,596
我只想帮自己
I give a shit about helping me,

644
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:44,913
-所以我要五万美元  -什么
- which is why I want $50,000. - What?

645
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:47,219
我说了...你们害我损失惨重
I just told you-- you cost me millions.

646
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,352
-如果想要我帮忙  -算了
- So if you want my help-- - Okay, never mind.

647
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,326
迈克  我就知道这样行不通
Mike, I knew this was a bad idea.

648
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:52,105
-我们可以支付  -迈克
- We'll pay it. - Mike.

649
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,018
瑞秋  如果她真能搞到有用的东西
Rachel, if she can get us something we can use,

650
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:56,454
这个钱就花的值  钱从和解提议中扣
it's worth it. It'll come out of the settlement offer.

651
00:28:56,455 --> 00:28:58,640
我要预支
Uh-uh, I want it up front.

652
00:28:58,868 --> 00:29:00,772
我们怎么知道你不会拿了钱
And how do we know that you won't take the money and say

653
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:03,297
-还说你什么也没找到  -你没法知道
- that you couldn't find anything? - You don't,

654
00:29:03,552 --> 00:29:04,937
但你们还杵在这里
but, given the fact that you're still here,

655
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:06,793
说明你们没有多少选择的余地
it doesn't look like you have much of a choice.

656
00:29:09,699 --> 00:29:11,634
最近怎么样  路易
So how are you, Louis?

657
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,031
想知道我怎么样  那我就好好说说
Wanna know how I'm doing? I'll tell you how I'm doing.

658
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:15,653
我想把重心放在工作上
I tried focusing on my professional life

659
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:18,450
而不是个人私事  结果灾难一场
instead of my personal one, and it's been a goddamn disaster.

660
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,499
我想是因为你心里想着塔拉的事
I take it your thoughts of Tara have been getting

661
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,713
-妨碍了你的工作  -什么
- in the way of work. - What?

662
00:29:21,714 --> 00:29:23,914
不  我已经忘了她  故事翻篇了
No, I'm over her-- she's yesterday's news.

663
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:25,923
听你的话好像不是这么回事
Your words make me think otherwise.

664
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:27,599
那你好好听听我的话
Well, how about you listen to these words:

665
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,853
哈维要让他一个朋友做冠名合伙人
Harvey's making his friend name partner.

666
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:32,285
他还说是我在妒忌  我不知道怎么办
He's accused me of being jealous, and I don't know what to do.

667
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:33,125
那你是在妒忌吗
Are you jealous?

668
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:35,010
我当然妒忌死了
Of course I'm goddamn jealous!

669
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:38,818
路易  你有这种感觉很正常
Louis, it's natural for you to feel that way.

670
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:41,342
你卖力工作才有了今天的地位
You've worked hard to get where you are,

671
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:43,740
突然冒出一个人对你产生威胁
and a new person threatens your position in the firm.

672
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:47,302
不是...不是这样的
That's not-- That's just not it.

673
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,880
杰西卡离开的唯一好处
The one silver lining of Jessica leaving

674
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:56,321
就是我以为哈维终于能够重视我
was that I thought that Harvey would finally turn to me,

675
00:29:56,322 --> 00:29:59,552
不仅作为合伙人  而且作为朋友
not only as his partner, but as his friend.

676
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:03,706
但这希望破灭了  因为我快被人替代了
That's not happening now because I'm being replaced.

677
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:06,342
所以你在害怕失去朋友
And you're scared of losing your friend.

678
00:30:08,713 --> 00:30:09,736
我该怎么办
What do I do?

679
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:13,642
我无法告诉你答案  路易
I can't tell you that, Louis,

680
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:15,524
但我要告诉你
but I can tell you

681
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,653
是你的所作所为导致塔拉离你而去
it was your behavior that drove Tara away,

682
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:22,374
如果你继续放任自己感情用事
and, if you keep letting your emotions dictate your behavior,

683
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:25,446
也不用再担心被他人替代
you won't need to worry about being replaced.

684
00:30:26,483 --> 00:30:29,306
因为你自己就会亲手把哈维推开
You'll drive Harvey away all by yourself.

685
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:39,856
从来没见过你加班这么晚
I'm not sure I've ever seen you here this late.

686
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:42,582
新办公室  新作息表
New office, new hours.

687
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,114
我想也是
I guess so.

688
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:49,216
卡特里娜  你想说什么
Katrina, whatever's on your mind,

689
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:51,824
直说就好
I recommend you just say it.

690
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:56,476
你知道  我在律所的目标是高级合伙人
As you know, I'm on track to be a senior partner here.

691
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,053
事实上  这也是我答应回来的主要原因之一
In fact, it's one of the main reasons I agreed to come back.

692
00:30:59,053 --> 00:30:59,850
我知道
I know.

693
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,690
我不是说你不应该提拔唐娜...
I'm not saying Donna doesn't deserve a promotion--

694
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:05,217
我知道她不比任何人的功劳小
I know what she does as much as anyone.

695
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:09,408
我只是想说成为合伙人意义重大
I'm just saying making partner means something,

696
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:14,392
而我担心这个先例会破坏这个意义
and I'm concerned that being one here won't mean what it used to.

697
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:18,923
你想让我怎么做
What would you have me do?

698
00:31:20,092 --> 00:31:22,064
我不知道  我只是觉得
I don't know. I just thought,

699
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:25,635
我有这个想法  那其他人可能也会这么想
if I was thinking it, it occurred to me that others might be too,

700
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:28,181
我觉得应该告诉你
and I thought you should know that.

701
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:34,641
卡特里娜  成为合伙人的意义将一如既往
Katrina, being a partner here will mean as much as it always has.

702
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:36,886
我会保证这一点
I'll make sure of it.

703
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:55,787
我希望你是来告诉我
I hope you came here to tell me

704
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:56,818
你把事情都搞定了
you got everything straightened out.

705
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:59,449
我来是想告诉你  我们的约定作废
I came here to tell you that the deal's off the table.

706
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:01,423
你说什么
What?

707
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,810
冠名合伙人意义重大  我不能
Name partner means something, and I can't just give it away

708
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:08,167
为了立威随便给人  我最初就不该
to make a statement. I never should've offered it to you

709
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,878
-给你这个提议  -该死  哈维
- in the first place. - God damn it, Harvey.

710
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:11,649
这是你第二次放我水了
This is the second time you've done this.

711
00:32:11,772 --> 00:32:14,971
抱歉  亚历克斯  但这事没有商量
And I'm sorry, Alex, but this is a take it or leave it offer.

712
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,544
你可以考虑到明天
You can let me know in the morning.

713
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,716
我接受
I'll take it.

714
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:30,498
我其实不可能在一年内成为冠名合伙人
I wasn't really gonna make name partner in a year.

715
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,357
也许永远成为不了
Maybe not ever.

716
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:35,620
我知道
I know.

717
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:37,813
你怎么知道
How?

718
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,561
因为如果他们真能一年内给你
Because if they were really gonna do it in a year,

719
00:32:40,562 --> 00:32:42,226
在我离开你办公室那一刻
you would've leveraged them to move it up

720
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,657
你就会利用我的条件要他们现在就给
the second I left your office.

721
00:32:43,722 --> 00:32:45,382
那你之前为什么没揭穿我
So why didn't you call me on that before?

722
00:32:45,836 --> 00:32:46,703
我不知道
I don't know.

723
00:32:46,744 --> 00:32:48,333
或许是因为我觉得亏欠你
Maybe it's because I felt like I owe you,

724
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:50,788
也或许是因为我想向外界证明
or maybe because I wanted to prove to the world

725
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:52,257
我不是杰西卡
that I'm not Jessica.

726
00:32:52,952 --> 00:32:54,892
又或许是因为  我就是单纯想跟你共事
Or maybe it's because I wanted to work together.

727
00:32:57,235 --> 00:32:58,547
我们周一见  哈维
I'll see you Monday, Harvey.

728
00:32:59,282 --> 00:33:00,176
周一见
See you Monday.

729
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:07,066
我来付吧
I'll get that.

730
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:08,880
省省吧  罗斯先生
Keep your money, Mr. Ross.

731
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:09,883
你赚大钱的日子快到头了
You're gonna need it.

732
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:11,375
我觉得等你看了这个
I think, after you see this,

733
00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:13,091
恐怕一分钱都要掰成两半花了
you're gonna wanna save every nickel you have.

734
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:16,301
谢谢
Thanks.

735
00:33:19,452 --> 00:33:21,850
如果错了请更正我  但我想这是
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that's a memo

736
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:24,853
欧酷曼公司高管及其销售人员的备忘录
between Acumen senior management and their sales force

737
00:33:25,273 --> 00:33:28,126
所列政策显示他们会不顾一切
outlining their policy of doing whatever it takes

738
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:29,653
避免支付保险金
to avoid paying claims.

739
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:31,885
这可以从很多角度来解读
Well, this thing can be interpreted a dozen different ways.

740
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:32,976
证明不了什么
It doesn't prove a thing.

741
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,726
但它证明此事不再仅仅关乎我的委托人
But it proves that we're not just talking about my client anymore.

742
00:33:35,874 --> 00:33:37,252
你需要担心的是集体诉讼了
You're looking at a class action.

743
00:33:37,353 --> 00:33:38,607
唯一能比冒牌律师
And if there's one thing that a jury hates

744
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:41,206
更招陪审团讨厌的  就是一家
more than a fake lawyer, it's an insurance company

745
00:33:41,206 --> 00:33:43,040
剥削鳏夫和幼小的保险公司
that rips off widowers and children.

746
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:46,746
-你想要什么  -五千万
- What do you want? - 50 million.

747
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:48,418
同时保险公司认罪
With an admission of guilt.

748
00:33:48,418 --> 00:33:50,535
不行  他们不可能认罪
No way, they won't go for admission.

749
00:33:50,536 --> 00:33:52,720
好吧  那你还有一条路可选
Okay, then here's what you're gonna do instead.

750
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:55,913
有记者会联系你
A reporter's gonna call you.

751
00:33:56,378 --> 00:33:58,430
然后你告诉他  你本以为
And when he does, you're gonna tell him the story of

752
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,590
可以羞辱一位冒牌律师
how you thought you were gonna wipe the floor

753
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:03,559
但结果是你开始祈祷
with this fraudulent attorney, but instead you ended up praying

754
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,579
永远不在庭上再遇到他
that you never go up against him again.

755
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:08,188
你早知道他们不会认罪
You knew they wouldn't go for admission.

756
00:34:08,189 --> 00:34:09,348
给我挖坑让我往里跳
You set me up.

757
00:34:09,543 --> 00:34:11,399
既然你这么说  我就不否认了
Well, now that you mention it,I did.

758
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:15,528
一口价  没商量
And that's take it or leave it.

759
00:34:15,724 --> 00:34:17,159
那我接受吧
Then I guess I'll take it.

760
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,781
我就不提你为了给自己脸上贴金
And leave out the part where you traded admission of guilt

761
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,560
放弃公司认罪的事了
in exchange for self-promotion.

762
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,193
你没资格跟我说这种话
Don't you dare say that to me.

763
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,158
我这么做不是为了自己
I'm not doing this for myself.

764
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,084
而是为了让你这样的混蛋
I'm doing it so that pieces of shit like you

765
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:32,173
永远别再想利用我的黑历史攻击我的委托人
never try to use my history against my clients again.

766
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:42,016
路易  在你开口前...
Louis, before you say anything...

767
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:43,240
哈维  在你开口前
Harvey, before you say anything,

768
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:44,785
我想先说声对不起
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

769
00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:46,637
你是对的
You were right.

770
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:50,816
我是嫉妒亚历克斯来  但不是因为
I was jealous of Alex coming over here, but not because

771
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:53,384
-我怕来自律师的竞争  -我没听懂
- I'm afraid of another lawyer. - I don't understand.

772
00:34:53,431 --> 00:34:55,250
听着  哈维  我知道你喜欢拿我开心
See, Harvey, I know you like to make fun of me,

773
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:58,576
我也知道也许我对你的意义并没有
and I know I might not mean as much to you

774
00:34:58,577 --> 00:35:01,505
你对我的意义重大  但你是我朋友
as you mean to me, but you're my friend,

775
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,885
而且我又没几个朋友  所以这份友谊
and, because I don't have many, that friendship

776
00:35:04,412 --> 00:35:05,599
对我来说很重要
is important to me.

777
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:07,064
你不用担心这一点  路易
You don't have to worry about that, Louis.

778
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:11,294
但我不希望我的行为导致我们产生隔阂
But I don't want my behavior to drive a wedge between us,

779
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,516
所以我接受亚历克斯成为冠名合伙人
which means I accept Alex as name partner.

780
00:35:16,022 --> 00:35:17,484
-关于这点  路易...  -这就像
- About that, Louis... - I mean, it's just gonna

781
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:20,670
勒布朗・詹姆斯加入迈阿密热队的时候
have to be like when LeBron James joined the Miami Heat

782
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,302
他和韦德是怎样跟克里斯・波什处理关系的
when he and D-Wade worked it out with Chris Bosh.

783
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,294
我以为你对体育一窍不通
I thought you didn't know anything about sports.

784
00:35:26,014 --> 00:35:28,265
我为了想个合适的类比熬了一整晚
I stayed up all night trying to come up with the right analogy.

785
00:35:29,552 --> 00:35:30,815
而且如果我没记错  他们后来
And, if I'm not mistaken, they went on to

786
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:32,372
在超级杯取得了连胜
win back-to-back Super Bowls.

787
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:35,452
也没错
That they did.

788
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,917
路易  不管怎样  亚历克斯还是要来
Louis, for what it's worth, Alex is still coming,

789
00:35:38,918 --> 00:35:40,656
-但他不会成为冠名合伙人  -真的吗
- but not as name partner. - Really?

790
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:42,205
是的  你说得对
Yeah, you were right.

791
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,534
不该这样稀释公司的质量
We can't water down the firm like that.

792
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,875
你以前从不敲门的
You've never knocked before.

793
00:35:57,487 --> 00:35:59,219
你的办公室以前也没有门
And you've never had a door before.

794
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:01,905
我知道  有门是件好事  因为...
I know, and it's a good thing I do because--

795
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:03,479
你不能当合伙人  唐娜
You can't be a partner, Donna.

796
00:36:03,513 --> 00:36:04,326
什么
What?

797
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,058
你不能这样
You can't do that.

798
00:36:07,571 --> 00:36:08,956
我不得不这样  我犯了个错误
I have to. I made a mistake.

799
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:12,643
扯淡  我付了你五十万
Bullshit, I-- I paid you $500,000.

800
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:14,691
你还没签合伙协议  所以
You haven't signed the partnership agreement yet,

801
00:36:14,948 --> 00:36:16,590
我可以把钱退给你  然后...
so I can refund your money, and--

802
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,740
我不要退款  我要你说到做到
I don't want a refund. I want what we agreed to.

803
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:19,897
我做不到
I can't do that.

804
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:24,439
你不是律师出身  而律所合伙人...
You are not a lawyer, and being partner at a law firm--

805
00:36:25,006 --> 00:36:28,730
是有意义的  在公司内外分量都不轻
it means something, inside the firm and out,

806
00:36:28,731 --> 00:36:31,032
所以我重新起草了一份聘任合同
which is why I wrote up a new release for you.

807
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:37,720
你写的是"人事部部长"
This says "Director of Personnel."

808
00:36:38,028 --> 00:36:39,299
大家都知道你对于人事管理很有一套
Everybody knows you're great with people,

809
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,204
对外这样讲  但就你我而言...
so it'll play out there, but, between you and me--

810
00:36:41,205 --> 00:36:43,640
不  哈维  我要当合伙人不是为了
No, Harvey, I didn't ask for partner just so I could

811
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:46,212
继续无名无份的做女超人拯救一切
keep being a superwoman behind closed doors,

812
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:49,081
而在外人眼里只是个名头好的办公室主任
but, to the rest of the world, be a glorified office manager.

813
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,362
合伙人绝对不可能  唐娜
Partner is off the table, Donna.

814
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:55,532
那留着我的买进股资  我要当首席运营官
Then keep my buy-in and make me COO.

815
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,365
这我也做不到  这和合伙人是一回事
I can't do that-- that's the same as a partner.

816
00:36:57,366 --> 00:36:59,678
不是  世达・赞恩  布莱顿・古尔德
No, it isn't. Skadden and Zane

817
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,171
都有首席运营官  而且都不是律师出身
and Bratton Gould all have COOs, and none of them are lawyers.

818
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:04,950
你怎么会知道这些
How do you know that?

819
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:06,411
因为我一开始就知道
'Cause I never thought you'd make me partner

820
00:37:06,412 --> 00:37:07,419
你不会让我当合伙人
in the first place.

821
00:37:11,818 --> 00:37:12,903
好吧  成交
Okay, it's a deal.

822
00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:14,141
而且我要留着我的投票权
And I keep my vote.

823
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,490
-唐娜...  -私底下
- Donna-- - Within these walls,

824
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:18,565
仍然要有我的一席之地  一口价
I have a seat at the table. Take it or leave it.

825
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:22,113
我接受
I'll take it.

826
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,457
谢谢你  哈维
Thanks, Harvey.

827
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,683
你会是个很棒的首席运营官
You're gonna make a hell of a COO.

828
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:43,559
怎么样  顺利吗
And? How'd it go?

829
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,397
精彩极了
Out of the park.

830
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,032
我们想要的都拿到了
Got everything we wanted.

831
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:52,598
我们今晚出去庆祝一下怎么样
What do you say we go out and celebrate tonight?

832
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,039
我们要庆祝  但是不能出门了
Well, we're celebrating, but we're not going out.

833
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:58,331
什么意思
What do you mean?

834
00:38:00,065 --> 00:38:02,594
《时代周刊》有个记者五分钟后就到
A reporter from "The Times" Is gonna be here in five minutes.

835
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:06,355
-好吧  -我们要接受个采访
- Okay. - We are doing an interview.

836
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:09,461
欺诈律师的救赎之路
The redemption of a fraudulent lawyer.

837
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:15,749
这是自你进入律师协会以来
Well, that is the best news I've heard since finding out

838
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,928
-最好的消息  -谢谢
- you got into the bar. - Thank you.

839
00:38:19,774 --> 00:38:21,519
但我觉得你应该自己接受采访
But I think you should do it without me.

840
00:38:21,906 --> 00:38:25,483
瑞秋  没有你  我根本做不到这一切
Rachel, I--I couldn't have done any of this without you.

841
00:38:25,484 --> 00:38:27,664
或许如此  但这是你自己的故事
And that may be true, but this is your story,

842
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:29,994
应该由你亲自讲述
and you should be the one to tell it.

843
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:40,828
去吧  我在家等你
Go--I'll see you at home.

844
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,843
-迈克  -你好
- Mike? - Yeah.

845
00:39:02,037 --> 00:39:03,583
-我是大卫・格鲁因  -很高兴认识你
- David Gruen. - Good to meet you.

846
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:05,240
你想在哪里做采访
Where do you want to do this?

847
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:07,200
我觉得你的新办公室很合适
I was thinking maybe your new office.

848
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:09,519
不错  那里可以当最后一站
Uh, yeah, we could end up there.

849
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:12,421
但我觉得或许应该从我起步的地方开始
But I was thinking maybe we'd start out where I started out.

850
00:39:12,481 --> 00:39:14,821
-那是哪里  -大办公室
- Where's that? - In the bullpen.

851
00:39:30,944 --> 00:39:32,135
又怎么了  哈维
What is it now, Harvey?

852
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:34,626
想让门房负责破产事务吗
You want to put the janitor in charge of bankruptcy?

853
00:39:34,627 --> 00:39:38,760
还是让楼下的保安做诉讼带头人
Or the guard downstairs could be head of litigation.

854
00:39:38,761 --> 00:39:41,342
-发泄完了吗  -那要看你接下来说什么
- Are you finished? - Depends on what you say next.

855
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,127
很抱歉我那么说你
I'm sorry I said those things about you,

856
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:45,241
我想跟你说  我心里并不那么想
and I want you to know I didn't mean any of them.

857
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,417
我也很抱歉  哈维
I'm sorry too, Harvey.

858
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,701
杰西卡  你不用道歉的
Jessica, you don't need to apologize.

859
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:51,664
不  我用
Yes, I do.

860
00:39:53,197 --> 00:39:55,578
你只是在拆我的雕像
You were just tearing the statue down.

861
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:59,074
就像很多年前你看着我做的一样的事
Just like you saw me do all those years ago,

862
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:00,410
而我不开心
and I didn't like it

863
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:03,212
只是因为这次是我的雕像
because the statue was me.

864
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:05,462
如果你不介意
Well, if it's the same to you,

865
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,848
我希望留下你的雕像
I'd like the statue to stay.

866
00:40:08,717 --> 00:40:09,802
我觉得可以
Sounds good to me.

867
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:12,774
-还有件事  -一向如此
- There's one more thing. - There always is.

868
00:40:14,227 --> 00:40:17,958
亚历克斯还是会进律所  不当冠名合伙人
I'm still bringing Alex over, only not as a name partner,

869
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:22,246
但辉瑞制药仍坚持让我们放弃吉姆・雷诺兹
but Pfizer's still insisting we drop Jim Reynolds.

870
00:40:22,781 --> 00:40:24,465
你想知道我能不能接受
And you want to know if I'm okay with it?

871
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:27,461
不  我肯定要放弃他
No, I'm letting him go.

872
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,811
只是在告诉他之前先打电话告诉你
I'm just calling you to tell you before I tell him,

873
00:40:30,812 --> 00:40:32,651
做我一开始就该做的事
like I should've done in the first place.

874
00:40:34,438 --> 00:40:36,726
当我说你还没准备好时  我错了  哈维
I was wrong when I said you weren't ready, Harvey.

875
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:38,264
不  当时没错
No, you weren't,

876
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,360
错的是这句
but you are now.

877
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,009
晚安  高手
Good night, Closer.

878
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:44,154
晚安  杰西卡
Good night, Jessica.

879
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,579
还有  不许把脚搭在我桌子上
And take your feet off my desk.

880
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:48,682
没门
Not a chance.
