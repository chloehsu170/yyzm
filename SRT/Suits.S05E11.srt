{\an8}《诉讼双雄》前情提要

15
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,770
迈克・罗斯从没上过法学院
Mike Ross never went to law school.

16
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,150
我知道  但我还是雇了他
And ?I knew it, and I hired him anyway.

17
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,670
我还是不能留下来  哈维
I still can't stay, Harvey.

18
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,950
你弄的像是我夺走了
You're making it seem like I'm the one

19
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,670
你的梦幻婚礼一样
that's taking away your dream wedding.

20
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,860
本来就是你夺走了我的梦幻婚礼
You are the one taking away my dream wedding.

21
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,750
没什么能比让我
Nothing would make me happier

22
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,600
举杯庆祝你的新生活更能让我开心的
than to raise a glass to your new life,

23
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,610
但我不能
But I can't.

24
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,850
所以现在我不该结婚了
Oh, so now I shouldn't get married.

25
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,820
不  我是说你应该辞职
No, I'm saying you should quit.

26
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,290
所以你现在告诉我  你为什么来这里
You tell me right now, why are you here?

27
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,680
-一言难尽  -你为什么来这里
- It's not that simple. - Why are you here?

28
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,370
因为我害怕
Because I'm afraid!

29
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,930
你今天召集了紧急不信任投票
You're calling for an emergency vote of no confidence today?

30
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,830
合个影吧  因为明天早上
Take a picture, because tomorrow morning,

31
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,000
这些字母就要撤下来了
those letters are coming down.

32
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,520
我为什么要相信你真的会
Why should I believe you would even live up

33
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,740
实现你的承诺呢
to your end of the bargain?

34
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,360
因为我根本不在乎
Because I don't give a shit

35
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,240
你跟丹尼尔・哈德曼的斗争
about your war with Daniel Hardman.

36
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,180
我想要的只是看着你跪下
All I want to do is see you get down on your knees and say,

37
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,760
说"我退出"
"I quit."

38
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,330
此时此刻  狙击我们客户的公司
As of now, the company that's been targeting our clients

39
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,280
已经不由丹尼尔・哈德曼代理了
is no longer represented by daniel hardman.

40
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,150
所有支持杰西卡留下的人  举手
All in favor of jessica staying?

41
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,640
你到底是怎么从傅滋曼那儿拿到解约书的
How exactly did you get that termination letter for Forstman?

42
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,180
我同意辞职
I agreed to step down.

43
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,280
你不能辞职
You are not going to step down.

44
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,330
你为这律所付出了一切
You've given up everything for this firm.

45
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,780
该有人为你付出点东西了
It's time someone gave up something for you.

46
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,030
哈维  你不光给了我梦想
Harvey, you didn't just give me my dream.

47
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,470
还给了我一个家
You gave me a family.

48
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,380
但我终有一天会有自己的家
But I'm gonna have a family of my own someday,

49
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,210
我不能让这些事悬在他们头上
And I can't have all of this hanging over their heads.

50
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,120
你不必为我这么做
You don't have to do this for me.

51
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,520
我是为了我们
I'm doing it for us,

52
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,660
因为只要你支持我
'cause as long as you're with me--

53
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,020
我支持你
I'm with you.

54
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,830
-迈克・詹姆斯・罗斯  -怎么了
- Michael James Ross. - Yes?

55
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,140
你因共谋欺诈被捕了
You're under arrest for conspiracy to commit fraud.

56
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,130
迈克・罗斯  我是助理检察官安妮塔・吉布斯
Michael Ross, I'm assistant U.S. Attorney Anita Gibbs,

57
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,090
不像你  我是个正牌律师
And unlike you, I'm a real attorney.

58
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,320
我在见到我律师之前
I'm not answering any questions

59
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,540
不会回答任何问题
until I speak to my lawyer.

60
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,860
我听说你之前要求他来
I heard you asked for him before,

61
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,260
在我们静候时  我想让你知道
But while we're waiting, I just wanted to let you know

62
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,200
我会把你扔进监狱的
that I'm the one who's gonna put you in jail.

63
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,190
什么都不说
Nothing?

64
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,730
你可能觉得你这是无受害人犯罪
Maybe you think that you've committed a victimless crime,

65
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,900
但我向你保证  并不是
But let me assure you, you haven't.

66
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,790
据我估计  在你所谓的职业生涯中
By my estimation, you've worked on 88 legal cases

67
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,440
经手了88件案子
in your so-called career,

68
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,140
每一次你拿起电话
And you committed fraud every time you picked up the phone,

69
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,110
发送邮件  签名
mailed a letter, signed your name,

70
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,850
或者出庭  你都在诈骗
or appeared in court.

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,990
一个案件能判九个月监禁
Each instance carries a nine-month sentence,

72
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,070
跟你说实话吧
And to tell you the truth,

73
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,920
我都懒得算了
I am too tired to do the addition.

74
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,260
我不懒
Well, I'm not.

75
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,280
如果你说的是真的
If what you're saying is true

76
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,390
且每个案子限定为一次庭审
and there's a limit of one count per case,

77
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,730
那我将坐66年的牢
Then I'll be going to prison for 66 years.

78
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,980
我数学相当好
I've always been good at math.

79
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,600
我数学没那么好
Well, I haven't.

80
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,940
我拿手的是把像你这种
But what I am good at is putting away

81
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,430
虚伪自大的骗子送进监狱
fake, cocky tough guys like you

82
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,930
然后看着你们垮掉
and seeing them break.

83
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,920
因此  接下来
So here's how this is gonna go.

84
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,010
你要是配合  我就不难为你
You play ball, I go easy on you.

85
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,640
不配合的话
You don't--

86
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,640
就我经验看
In my experience,

87
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,590
上过大学的人  即使是个冒牌大学生
college boys, even fake ones,

88
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,950
在监狱都很难撑下来
don't do well in prison.

89
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,160
如果你觉得你的人
And if you think your people

90
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
正在赶来保释你
are rushing down here to bail you out,

91
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,290
你想多了
you've got another thing coming,

92
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,640
因为今晚我不会让你离开这的
because I'm gonna keep you in here all night.

93
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,530
行
Okay.

94
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,730
我会认罪的
I'll confess.

95
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,300
但我需要全程录影带记录
But I want the whole thing on tape.

96
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,960
哈维  谢天谢地  我有事跟你说
Harvey, thank god. I need to talk to you.

97
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,180
瑞秋  冷静一下  怎么了
Rachel, calm down. What's going on?

98
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,260
-迈克被捕了  -什么
- Mike's been arrested. - What?

99
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,540
有两个检察院的人
Two men from the U.S. Attorney's office--

100
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,430
直接冲他上去  逮捕了他
They just walked right up to him, and they arrested him.

101
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,370
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

102
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,750
好好  不会有事的
All right. It's gonna be okay.

103
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,230
怎么可能没事  他现在孤身一人
It's not gonna be okay! He's by himself.

104
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,300
我们得想想办法
We have to do something.

105
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,860
我马上就去找他
I'm going down there right now.

106
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,710
你不能去
No, you're not.

107
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,760
杰西卡  这不是为了你
Jessica, this isn't up for you--

108
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,180
哈维  从现在开始
Harvey, from this second,

109
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,090
你是个没被指控的同伙
you are an unindicted co-conspirator,

110
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,930
我同样是
and so am I.

111
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,050
你也一样
And so are you,

112
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,150
也就是说  我们谁都担不起靠近他的风险
which means none of us can afford to be anywhere near Mike.

113
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,270
我不管  总有人得做点什么
I don't care. Someone has to do something.

114
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,320
如果这个人不是你  那就是我
And if it isn't going to be you, it's going to be me.

115
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,630
你会让她去
You're gonna let her go down there?

116
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,460
哈维  她想去就可以去
Harvey, she can knock on that door all she wants.

117
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,760
但他们今晚不会让她见他的
They're not gonna let her see him tonight.

118
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,320
再说了  她是他的未婚妻
Besides, she's his fiancée.

119
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,060
去见他不会让她看起上去有罪
Seeing him is not gonna make her look guilty.

120
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,780
我去也不会
It's not gonna make me look guilty either.

121
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,960
我是为了帮我兄弟
It makes me look like I'm standing by my guy.

122
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,110
唯一能让你看上去无罪的是
No, what's gonna keep you from looking guilty

123
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,170
咱俩撕了你的辞职信
is you and I ripping up your letter of resignation.

124
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,210
杰西卡  我和傅滋曼达成了协议
Jessica, I just made a deal with Forstman.

125
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,930
如果他发现我还在公司
He finds out that I'm still here,

126
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,710
他只要给哈德曼打个电话
He picks up the phone, calls Hardman,

127
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,300
他俩就能毁了整间律所
And the two of them pick this place apart.

128
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,050
不管是谁负责追诉这个案子
And if whoever is prosecuting this case

129
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,970
发现他们逮捕迈克当晚你就辞职
finds out you left on the same night they arrested Mike,

130
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,420
那我们还不如赶紧自首
then we may as well turn ourselves in.

131
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,150
这就是为什么我得
Which is why I need to get in there

132
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,400
作为迈克的律师去找他
And talk to Mike as his lawyer.

133
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,870
那接下来事情要这样
Then this is what's going to happen.

134
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,230
现在你是他的律师
You are now his lawyer.

135
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,090
你在这里做你要做的事
But you do whatever you have to do to work out of your house,

136
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,020
因为我不会告诉任何人你辞职了
because I'm not telling anybody you resigned.

137
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,330
这里是检察官助理安妮塔・吉布斯和迈克・罗斯
This is AUSA Anita Gibbs with Michael Ross.

138
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,940
现在是晚上11:05
The time is 11:05 P.M.

139
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,620
罗斯先生同意认罪
Mr. Ross has agreed to confess,

140
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,360
前提是需要录像带记录整个过程
with the stipulation that he do it on videotape.

141
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,880
实际上我没说要认罪
I actually never said I'd confess.

142
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,140
我是说我会谈谈
I said I'd talk.

143
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,610
你说的确实是认罪
You did say you'd confess.

144
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,920
也许我是说了  但同时
Maybe I did, but then again,

145
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,230
我在9:03时就要求见我的律师了
I also asked to see my lawyer at 9:03.

146
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,220
两小时过去了
It's two hours later,

147
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,660
而我还没有见到我的律师
and I still haven't been able to do that,

148
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,230
这意味着从那时到现在这段时间内
which means anything that I've said

149
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,430
我所说的一切都不能作为证据
between then and now is not only inadmissible,

150
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,980
同时这还是你侵犯了我的权力的证据
it's also evidence that you violated my rights.

151
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,990
我明白了  你只是想把这段录下来
Oh, I get it. You just wanted to get that on tape.

152
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,070
当然
Sure did.

153
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,890
还有  假如一小时只内我见不到我的律师
And if I don't see my lawyer in an hour,

154
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,870
你最好能够证明你尽了最大努力
you better be able to prove that you've made every effort

155
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,400
去联系他  但失败了
to contact him and couldn't.

156
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,660
我明白我不该知道这些事
I know I'm not supposed to know these things

157
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,660
因为我不是律师  但我确实知道...
because I'm not a lawyer, but I do...

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,730
因为我是律师
because I am.

159
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,550
好了  你玩够了吧
Okay, you've had your fun.

160
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,030
轮到我了
Now I'm gonna have mine.

161
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,770
你的律师半小时前确实出现过
Your lawyer actually did show up about half hour ago.

162
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,570
但关于你在哪间房间的问题上
There seemed to be a little miscommunication

163
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,030
出了点沟通问题
about what room you were in,

164
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,040
但后来一切都弄清楚了
But that's all been straightened out.

165
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,130
所以...
So...

166
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,720
他来了
Here he is.

167
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
罗伯特
Robert.

168
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,060
我明白了
Oh, I see.

169
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,330
你以为你会见到哈维・斯佩克特
You thought you were gonna see Harvey Specter

170
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,270
走进这间房间
come in this room

171
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,300
这样你俩就能对好口供了
so you two could get your stories straight.

172
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,990
显然这事儿不会发生了
Apparently that's not gonna happen.

173
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,880
通常这时我会离开房间
Now, normally this is the part where I leave the room,

174
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,970
但你看上去想让我留下啊
but almost looks like you want me to stay.

175
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,370
提醒你一句  我们没办法看到或记录
Just so you know, we can't watch or record

176
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,960
这里发生的任何事情...
anything that happens in here--

177
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,580
因为律师与当事人的特权之类的
attorney-client privilege and whatnot.

178
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,430
但假如你是无辜的
But if you're innocent of these charges,

179
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,230
我确信你没什么理由害怕
I'm sure you have nothing to fear,

180
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,340
单独和那个人...
being alone in this room...

181
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,270
待在这间房间里
with that man.

182
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,490
{\an8}诉讼双雄
第五季  第十一集

183
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,480
你来这里干什么  罗伯特
What are you doing here, Robert?

184
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,980
瑞秋打电话给我叫我来帮你
Rachel called me and asked me to help you.

185
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,810
-她还好吗  -不
- Is she okay? - No.

186
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,820
她不好
She's not,

187
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,850
因为她在外面  而你在里面
Because she's out there, and you're in here.

188
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,900
所以你得立刻告诉我
And so you're gonna tell me right now,

189
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,210
这件事是真的吗
is this shit true?

190
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,030
听着  我可以解释一切
Listen, I can explain everything.

191
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,150
我不需要解释
I don't need an explanation!

192
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,700
我只想要那个问题的答案
I want an answer to the goddamn question.

193
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,050
律师不会问那个问题的
Lawyers don't ask that question.

194
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,220
我不是以你的律师的身份在问你
I'm not asking you as your lawyer.

195
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,430
我是以一个男人的身份在发问
I'm asking you as a man.

196
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,490
你知道答案是什么的
You know what the answer is.

197
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,850
该死的
God damn it.

198
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,320
你想要真相  现在你得到真相了
You wanted the truth, and now you got it,

199
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,060
但你得告诉我你来这里干什么  罗伯特
But you got to tell me what are you doing here, Robert.

200
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,960
我告诉你了  我来这里是因为瑞秋求我来帮你
I told you, I'm here because Rachel begged me to help you...

201
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,770
不是因为我关心你的情况
not because I give a shit about what happens to you.

202
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,300
所以你得完全按照我说的做
So you're gonna do exactly what I say,

203
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,700
而我会帮你从这件事里脱身
and I'm gonna help you get out of this thing.

204
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,890
不  没有办法从中脱身的
No, there's no getting out of this thing.

205
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,330
是有的  而且你也清楚这一点
Oh, yes, there is, and you damn well know it.

206
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,250
那女人无法从起诉你这样一个骗子中得到任何东西
That woman doesn't get anything by prosecuting a fraud like you,

207
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,970
但她会很乐意抓住哈维・斯佩克特的
but she would love to get Harvey Specter.

208
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,120
我不会背叛哈维的
I'm not turning on Harvey.

209
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,430
他可是会毫不犹豫地出卖你
Oh, he would do the same goddamn thing to you in a heartbeat.

210
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,820
假如你那样想  那是你不了解哈维
If you think that, then you don't know Harvey.

211
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,130
你最好听我的
You better listen to me!

212
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,410
你最好想想清楚了
You better get your head out of your ass,

213
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,820
因为我抛给了你一条救生索
because I'm throwing you a goddamn lifeline.

214
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,920
这是拯救你那可悲人生仅存那点东西的
It's the only chance you're gonna get

215
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,100
唯一机会了
to save what's left of your miserable life.

216
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,620
我不会这么做的
I won't do it.

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,980
那你就自求多福吧
Then you are on your own.

218
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,660
罗伯特  拜托了...
Robert, please--

219
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,840
无论你想说什么...
Whatever you're gonna say...

220
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,680
别说
don't say it.

221
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,760
事实上  你是帮了我一个忙
The truth is, you're doing me a favor,

222
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,980
因为在我帮你脱身之后
because after I got you out of this,

223
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,010
我本来会要求你在余生中都远离瑞秋的
I was gonna tell you to stay away from Rachel for the rest of your life,

224
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,440
但如今我不用这么做了
but I don't have to do it now,

225
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,300
因为不管怎样你都要蹲监狱了
because you're gonna wind up in prison anyway.

226
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,080
路易
Louis.

227
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,050
-怎么回事  -唐娜  让我进去
- What's going on? - Donna, I need to come in.

228
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,960
发生什么事了
What happened?

229
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,130
唐娜  你得坐下
Donna, I need you to sit down.

230
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,680
-路易  -我说了你得坐下
- Louis-- - I said you need to sit down.

231
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,940
哈维出什么事了
What happened to Harvey?

232
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,810
求求你告诉我他没事
Please tell me that he's okay.

233
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,340
迈克被捕了
Mike's been arrested.

234
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,960
天呐
Oh, my god.

235
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,630
-我们得去看他  -不不不
- We have to go see him. - No, no, no.

236
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,180
我们不能接近他
We can't go anywhere near him.

237
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,670
-什么  -你不能过去
- What? - You can't go down there.

238
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,690
路易  上帝啊  假如你背弃了迈克
Louis, so help me god, if you turn your back on Mike

239
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,900
然后还声称这件事和你无关...
and you claim that this has nothing to do with you--

240
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,960
听我说
Just listen to me.

241
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,180
你会想尽一切努力
You're gonna want to do everything you can

242
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,990
去到迈克身边  以表支持
to get to Mike and express your support,

243
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,200
但我告诉你
but I am telling you,

244
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,330
那是个坏主意
that is a bad idea.

245
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,190
那我得和哈维谈谈
Then I need to talk to Harvey.

246
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,690
不  不行
No, you don't.

247
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,570
你和他也得离得远远的
You need to stay the hell away from him, too,

248
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,320
你该庆幸你不再为他工作了
and count your blessings that you don't work for him anymore,

249
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,670
因为假如忽然之间
'cause if all of a sudden

250
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,500
你开始出现在他面前
you start showing up on his doorstep,

251
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,850
你就会发现自己也上了检察官的黑名单了
you are gonna find yourself next up on the prosecutor's list.

252
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,810
路易  我们说的是迈克和哈维啊
Louis, this is Mike and Harvey we're talking about.

253
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,460
他们是我们的家人
They're family.

254
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,650
我没在否认这一点
I am not saying they're not.

255
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,640
我只是说你和他们联系得越紧密
I'm saying the more contact you have with them,

256
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,190
情况就会对我们所有人越不利
the worse it is for all of us.

257
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,900
好吧  我不会过去的
Okay, I won't go down there.

258
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,540
但我得去看看瑞秋
But I am going to see Rachel,

259
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,060
假如你觉得自己阻止得了我的话
and if you think you're gonna stop me,

260
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,580
那你就是疯了
you are out of your mind.

261
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,680
我告诉你了  我是他的律师
I am telling you, I am his attorney.

262
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,850
假如你不让我见他
If you don't let me see him,

263
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,480
我就闯进去
I'm gonna break through that door.

264
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,090
你可以随便吵吵  但你不能进去
You can bluster all you want, but you're not getting in

265
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,620
因为他的律师已经在里面了
because he's already with his attorney.

266
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,850
-什么  -你个肮脏的龟孙子
- What? - You dirty son of a bitch.

267
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,010
罗伯特  冷静
Robert, calm down.

268
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,520
滚你妈的冷静
I'm not calming shit.

269
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,260
你把这个孩子带进我的生活
You brought this kid into my life.

270
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,940
你危及了我女儿的未来
You put my daughter's future in jeopardy.

271
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,870
听着  我知道你很生气...
Look, I know you're upset--

272
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,510
生气
Upset?

273
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,470
你该庆幸我没有立马宰了你
You're lucky I don't lay you out right now.

274
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,070
罗伯特  听我说
Robert, listen to me.

275
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,110
迈克・罗斯是个好人
Mike Ross is a good man.

276
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,750
他遇到我的时候一无所有
He came to me from nothing.

277
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,930
但我看到了他身上的一些品质
I saw something in him,

278
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,690
你也一样看到了  所以你才会在这里
and you did, too, and that's why you're here.

279
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,170
不  我是来让他检举你的
No, I was here to get him to turn on you,

280
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,780
但他太蠢了没答应
but he's too stupid to do that.

281
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,480
我也不知道他会不会改变主意
And I don't know if he's gonna change his mind or not,

282
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,670
但我已经不在乎了
but I don't care anymore,

283
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,230
我也不在乎能不能再见到你们任何一个
and I don't give a damn if I ever see either of you again.

284
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,610
你听到了吗
Did you hear that?

285
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,850
他不再是迈克・罗斯的律师了  我才是
He's not Mike Ross's attorney anymore--I am.

286
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,290
赶紧让我进去
So let me the hell in.

287
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,330
罗伯特・赞恩  真的吗
Robert Zane? Really?

288
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,710
我很受伤
I'm hurt.

289
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,380
-哈维  这一切都是来真的  -我知道
- Harvey, this is real. - I know.

290
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,420
我们需要弄清楚的第一件事是谁告的密
And the first we need to figure out is who tipped them off.

291
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,720
我们为什么要那么做
Why the hell do we need to do that?

292
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,940
因为如果我们想把你救出去
Because if we're gonna get you out of this,

293
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,850
我们需要知道他们抓住的所有把柄
we have to know every damn thing they have on you.

294
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,260
你疯了吗  我出不去的
Are you crazy? There's no getting out of this.

295
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,560
我从来没有输过官司  也不会从这件开始输
I haven't lost a case before, and I'm not about to start now.

296
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,750
这不是普通的官司
This isn't just some other case.

297
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,330
他们需要去核实线索  当他们去的时候
They're gonna check the facts, and when they do--

298
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,920
他们只能发现我们让他们发现的信息
They're gonna find what we let them find.

299
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,850
-你无法保证这点  -我可以
- You can't know that. - Yes, I can.

300
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,030
-你胡扯  -我没有胡扯
- That's bullshit! - This is not bullshit!

301
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,420
我们能赢的
Look, we can win this case.

302
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,880
我不在乎赢不赢
I don't care about winning this thing.

303
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,620
你到底有什么毛病
What the hell is wrong with you?

304
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,090
哈维  我做了什么我知道
Harvey, I did this!

305
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,280
你什么都没做  因为他们没有证据
You didn't do shit because they don't have shit.

306
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,550
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

307
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,670
迈克  哈佛的数据库里有你
Mike, you're in the Harvard database.

308
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,300
你有成绩单
You have a transcript.

309
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,960
你也考过司法考试
You're in the bar.

310
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,780
你是个执业律师
You're a practicing attorney.

311
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,380
这些都是真的
Those facts are real,

312
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,830
就像你一路以来办过的每一个案子
just like every case you ever worked on

313
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,670
帮过的每一个人一样
and every person you've helped along the way.

314
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,670
哈维  这个女人不是在闹着玩
Harvey, this woman's not joking.

315
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,830
那个女人必须证明你是个冒牌货
That woman has to show you're a fraud,

316
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,000
但全世界都知道  你是个律师
but as far as the world knows, you're a goddamn lawyer,

317
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,440
而且会一直当下去
and that's the way it's gonna stay.

318
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,880
别忘了
And don't forget--

319
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,690
我们不需要证明你是个律师
we don't need to prove you're a lawyer.

320
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,020
她需要证明你不是
She needs to prove you're not.

321
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,460
瑞秋  冷静点
Rachel, calm down.

322
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,580
我无法冷静
I can't calm down.

323
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,980
没人能告诉我任何事  我也不能去见他
No one will tell me anything. I can't go and see him.

324
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,550
这是他人生最糟糕的时刻
It is the worst moment of his life,

325
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,640
我却不能陪在他身边
and I'm not there for him.

326
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,980
只要允许你会去的
Well, you will be when you can.

327
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,120
除此之外
On top of all that,

328
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,220
我也不知道我爸爸去了会做什么
I don't know what my dad's gonna do when he gets there.

329
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,710
你打给了你爸爸
You called your dad?

330
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,620
瑞秋  我认为这不是个好办法
Rachel, I don't think that was a good idea.

331
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,320
那我也不能坐在这里什么也不做啊
Well, I couldn't just sit here and do nothing.

332
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,630
迈克被逮捕了
Mike's been arrested.

333
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,360
杰西卡在说什么未被追诉共犯
Jessica's talking about unindicted co-conspirators.

334
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,350
那他和哈维一定会找到解决办法的
Okay, well then, he and Harvey will just have to work it out.

335
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,630
如果他们找不到呢
And what if they don't?

336
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,870
瑞秋  我之前遇到麻烦的时候
Rachel, when I was in trouble,

337
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,320
哈维帮我摆脱了困境
Harvey got me out of it.

338
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,540
他就是干这个的
This is what he does.

339
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,030
听我说  他一定会帮迈克拜托困境的
I am telling you, he will get Mike out of this.

340
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,300
只是
It's just...

341
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,380
一想到他
The thought of him...

342
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,470
一个人在里面
in there all alone.

343
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,540
他不会有事的
He'll be okay.

344
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,400
只是一晚而已
It's just one night.

345
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,510
你看什么
Man, what are you looking at?

346
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,580
没什么
Nothing.

347
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,120
你上上下下的打量我
Your eyes are going up and down on me, man.

348
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,490
不像没什么
It don't feel like nothing.

349
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,540
他们都说  没什么  什么也没做
They all say, "Nothing. Wasn't doing nothing."

350
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,060
进了这里  说什么做什么就都不重要了
It don't matter what you say and do once you're inside.

351
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,610
像你这样的  在里面撑不过一周
Little snot like you won't last a week.

352
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,340
听见我说的了吗
You hear what I said?

353
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,660
你在里面撑不过一周
You won't last a week in there.

354
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,170
你在这也许都撑不过一夜
You might not last a night in here.

355
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,300
听着  伙计
Listen, man--

356
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,680
你个混蛋  把手拿开
Hey! Get your hands off him, you piece of shit.

357
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,250
算你走运  但他们不会在这里一整晚的
You're lucky, but they won't be here all night.

358
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:58,970
是啊  但你也不会
Yeah, neither will you.

359
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,210
没事的  没事的
Hey, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

360
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,020
不用管他  我没事的
Leave him in here with me. It's cool.

361
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,300
我是说  除非你准备让一个联邦法警
I mean, unless you're gonna let a federal marshal

362
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,140
把我打一顿然后恐吓我
beat the shit out of me just to try and scare me

363
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,450
达成认罪协议
into making a deal.

364
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,750
罗恩・达米科探员  对吧
Agent Ron Da'mico, right?

365
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,320
我在大厅里看到你的照片了
Yeah, I saw your picture out in the hall

366
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,660
接受检察院颁奖
getting a commendation from the U.S. Attorney.

367
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,050
当然了  照片里你没胡子
Of course, you didn't have a beard in that photo,

368
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,990
但在我看来长的一样
but you look the same to me.

369
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
你是个聪明人
You're a smart kid.

370
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,780
我想你就是这样逃过惩罚的
I guess that's how you got away with what you got away with.

371
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,080
但你也不算逃过了  是吧
But you didn't really get away with it, did you?

372
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,420
我是个法警  但下一个人就不是了
I am a marshal, but the next guy won't be,

373
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,420
你要是也给他摆一副无所不知的态度
and you give him that know-it-all attitude,

374
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,870
就像我说的  你连一晚上都撑不过
and like I said, you won't last a night.

375
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,010
但顺便说一句  我不会被送走的
Yeah, well, for the record, I'm not getting sent away,

376
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,810
就算离开  也不会进监狱
but even if I was, it wouldn't be a place like that.

377
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,770
如果你认为自己能去个高级监狱
Oh, if you think you're going to club fed...

378
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,220
那你真是太不了解安妮塔・吉布斯了
you don't know Anita Gibbs.

379
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,370
做个好梦  亲爱的
Sleep well, sweetheart.

380
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,040
他怎么样
How is he?

381
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,740
他被拘留了
He's in custody.

382
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,730
保释听证会呢
And the bail hearing?

383
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,070
我不知道
I don't know,

384
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,990
因为我不是他的代理律师
Because I'm not representing him.

385
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,670
你的问题问完了吗
Now, are you done asking me questions?

386
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,120
因为我也有一些问题
Because I have a few of my own,

387
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,150
比如你怎么能这样
Like how the hell could you do this?

388
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,540
爸爸  因为我爱他
Dad, because I love him.

389
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,670
那很好  但你听起来像个孩子
That's sweet, but you sound like a teenager,

390
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,660
你妈妈知道了以后
and right now your mother is sobbing,

391
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,030
一直在抹眼泪
knowing what you've done to yourself.

392
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,360
爸爸  迈克还是那个曾经与你共事的人
Dad, Mike is the same man that you worked with.

393
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,280
而且你自己也说过
And you said yourself there are things

394
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,440
你过去也曾做过一些难以启齿的事
that you did in your past that you're not proud of.

395
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,500
不要拿我和他相提并论
Don't you dare compare me to him.

396
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,110
我可不是骗子
I am not a fraud.

397
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,780
我不是罪犯
I am not a criminal.

398
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,520
瑞秋
Rachel...

399
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,850
瑞秋
Rachel...

400
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,820
我试图把他救出来
I tried to get him out,

401
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,550
但他像生活在梦里面一样
but he's living in a dream world,

402
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,260
如果你觉得他不会再毁掉你的生活
and so are you if you think this boy is done 

403
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,050
那你也在做梦
ruining your life.

404
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,290
那你为什么还要来
Why did you even come here?

405
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,490
我来是想让你照照镜子
I came here to tell you to look in the mirror

406
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,940
然后摆脱他
and get rid of him.

407
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,340
我做不到
I can't do that.

408
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,000
那我也帮不了你
Then I can't help you.

409
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,610
我还在想你什么时候会来找我呢
I was wondering when you were gonna pay me a visit.

410
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,450
你认识我
You know who I am?

411
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,780
我认识我瞄准的每一个猎物
I know everyone in my crosshairs.

412
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,780
把奶油递给我  然后告诉我你来的目的
Now pass me the cream and tell me what you want.

413
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,770
我想知道你为什么在没有正当理由的情况下
I want to know why you arrested my associate

414
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,190
就逮捕了我的同事
without just cause.

415
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,020
因为迈克・罗斯是个骗子
Because Mike Ross is a fraud,

416
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,480
我保证会让他再也看不到
and I'm gonna make sure he never sees

417
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,880
法庭是什么样子
the inside of a courtroom again,

418
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,120
除非他穿上那件橙色的囚服上庭受审
unless he's wearing an orange jumpsuit.

419
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,130
至于现在  我就先失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse me,

420
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,050
我还有一场传讯要准备
I have an arraignment to prepare for.

421
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,710
如果我私下告诉你
What if I was to tell you off the record

422
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,750
迈克・罗斯已经打算辞职了呢
Mike Ross was about to resign?

423
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,290
那听起来还真是巧呢
I'd say that sounds very convenient.

424
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,260
不是巧合  我说的是实话
Well, it isn't. I'm telling you the truth.

425
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,570
如果你真的只是想
And if your interest really is

426
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,820
让他以后都上不了庭的话
in getting him out of the courtroom,

427
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,350
他其实也早有这个打算了
he was gonna do it himself.

428
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,890
我为什么要相信你
And why should I believe you?

429
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,800
我可以把他的辞职信给你
I can get you his letter of resignation.

430
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,340
你只要撤销指控
All you have to do is waive charges,

431
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,790
我就能让他同意以后永不涉足律师业
and I'll get him to agree never to practice law again.

432
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,820
我告诉你我会怎么做
I'll tell you what I'll do.

433
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,430
你把那封信给我  我就免了他的保释金
You get me that letter, and I'll waive his bail.

434
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,510
我不用你免保释金
I don't need you to waive bail.

435
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,040
不管多少钱  他付的起
Whatever it is, he can pay for it.

436
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,380
不  他付不起  因为我会冻结他的财产
No, he can't. I'll freeze his assets.

437
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,770
其实  我会让他连保释都保不了
In fact, I'll make sure that he doesn't get bail at all,

438
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,200
因为黑进律师资格名单是联邦犯罪
because hacking into the bar is a federal crime,

439
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,580
如果他有能力这么做
and if he can do that,

440
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,460
那他也一定可以潜逃出国
he sure as hell can flee the country.

441
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,370
你根本没有证据证明他黑进律师资格名单
You have no proof he hacked into the bar.

442
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,450
那不重要  这是他被指控的罪名
Doesn't matter. It's what he's accused of.

443
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,330
所以如果你想他今天能走出法庭
So you want to make sure he walks out of court today,

444
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,080
那就把信给我
you bring me the letter.

445
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,130
你最好是在打给我
That better be you calling down to my office

446
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,710
解释下为什么你的金童
to explain why your golden boy

447
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,650
昨晚因诈欺罪被捕了
was arrested for fraud last night.

448
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,290
我的金童
My golden boy?

449
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,680
是你提名他做合伙人的
You're the one that nominated him for partner.

450
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,870
因为你一直在否决他
Because you passed him over again and again,

451
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,670
我早知道这中间有猫腻
and I knew there was a reason for it,

452
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,140
但现在我知道是怎么回事了
but now I know what it was.

453
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,490
你想说什么
Just what are you implying? 

454
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,510
没想说什么
I'm not implying anything.

455
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,490
你早知道那孩子是个骗子
You knew that kid was a fraud,

456
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,170
就算你不知道  你也有义务知道
and even if you didn't, you should have.

457
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,560
所以到底是怎么回事
So what is it?

458
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,530
究竟你是一丘之貉  还是说你根本蠢到
Are you corrupt, or are you just so stupid

459
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,180
连自己的律所里发生了什么都不知道
you didn't know what was going on in your own firm?

460
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,330
张开你的狗眼看清楚你在说谁蠢  杰克
Watch who you're calling stupid, Jack,

461
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,300
毕竟你才是那个投票时两手插在口袋里
'cause you were the only idiot with his hands in his pockets

462
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,040
出洋相的蠢货
at that vote.

463
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,460
以前没有得到他们的支持
I didn't have their support then,

464
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,300
但我现在会的  因为哈维的门徒
but I will now, because Harvey's protégé

465
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,540
被当众拿下带出了律所
just got perp-walked out of this firm.

466
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,270
而这之后  哈维也不见人影
And since then, Harvey's nowhere to be found.

467
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,320
哈维在哪里就不劳你费心了
Harvey's whereabouts are none of your concern.

468
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,080
但是其他合伙人都很上心
Well, the partners are concerned.

469
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,520
他们需要一个信得过的领导者
They need a leader they can trust.

470
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,770
我猜现在肯定有人在游说他们说
and I'll bet someone's trying to convince them

471
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,980
你就是那个领导者吧
that leader is you.

472
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,830
快看看
Well, look at that.

473
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,380
你对你的律所还是有点了解的嘛
You do know what's going on in your own firm after all.

474
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,670
给你一些上位者的建议
I'm gonna give you some advice from the throne, 

475
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,590
免费
free of charge.

476
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,250
你在这家律所处于不实指控的危机关头
You attack this firm's leadership when it's in crisis

477
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,310
攻击领导层
over an unproven allegation...

478
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,510
这会让你看起来非常卑鄙
You're gonna look like a bottom-feeder.

479
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,150
就算他们把我投了出去
And even if they vote me out,

480
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,710
也不会投你入主
they sure as hell won't vote you in.

481
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,510
唐娜  你来干什么
Donna, what are you doing here?

482
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,810
格蕾琴说你有点不舒服
Gretchen told me you weren't feeling well,

483
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,320
所以我就顺道儿来看看你
so I dropped by to see how you're doing

484
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,990
然后告诉你别再编瞎话了
and tell you to cut the bullshit.

485
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,570
我不懂
I don't understand.

486
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,560
你从来没请过病假
You've never taken a sick day in your life,

487
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,830
现在迈克又刚刚被捕
and Mike just got arrested,

488
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,000
我想知道到底是出什么事了
so I want to know what the hell is going on.

489
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,010
我现在不能出现在办公室里
I can't be in the office right now.

490
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,110
为什么不行
Why not?

491
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,530
因为我辞职了
Because I resigned.

492
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,010
什么
What?

493
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,140
是因为迈克的事吗
Because of Mike?

494
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,250
因为这是唯一能让傅滋曼让步的办法
Because it's the only way to get Forstman to back off.

495
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:57,980
我才不管什么傅滋曼
I don't care about Forstman.

496
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,320
你要在律所最需要你的时候离开我们
You're leaving the firm when we need you the most?

497
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,630
唐娜  现在这个关头我必须得远离办公室
Donna, right now I have to stay away from the office,

498
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,440
但我不是要离开谁
but I'm not leaving anyone.

499
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,660
我现在是迈克的律师
I'm representing Mike.

500
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,830
所以你见过他了
So you saw him.

501
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,280
-昨晚见的  -然后呢
- Last night. - And?

502
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,080
他还能坚持
He's hanging in.

503
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,590
我只是希望这次的保释听证会顺利进行
I just need this bail hearing to go smoothly.

504
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,220
什么叫顺利进行  发生什么事了
What do you mean, go smoothly? What's going on?

505
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,800
检察官这次是要来硬的了
The prosecutor's playing hardball.

506
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,330
她想让他不能保释
She's trying to keep him without bail.

507
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,270
哈维  瑞秋已经有点不太好了
Harvey, Rachel is not doing well.

508
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,030
你得把他弄出来
You have to get him out of there.

509
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,140
那我就需要你从办公室里拿点东西给我
Then I need you to get something from the office for me.

510
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,780
我听说你们已经达成免除保释金的协议了
I understand you've reached an agreement to waive bail?

511
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,920
是的  法官大人
We have, Your Honor.

512
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,940
本次保释不需要保释金
No bail is requested at this time.

513
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,690
-你确定  -是的  我确定
- Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.

514
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,210
但是  我想要引入一项动议
However, I would like to introduce a motion

515
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,590
即免除斯佩克特先生担任罗斯先生的律师一职
to have Mr. Specter removed as attorney for Mr. Ross.

516
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,860
-什么  -以什么理由
- What? - On what grounds?

517
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,190
理由是他们合谋
On the grounds that they conspired

518
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,120
欺骗了律师协会  欺骗了他们的每一位客户
to defraud the bar association, every client they ever had,

519
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,630
欺骗了全体美利坚人民
and the people of the United States.

520
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,530
你有什么证据
What's your proof?

521
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,700
这封信显示罗斯先生已经打算辞职
This letter showing Mr. Ross was going to resign.

522
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,370
他们合谋伪造了它
They conspired to fabricate it.

523
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,530
-我们之前说好了的  -我不管
- We had a deal. - I don't care what we had.

524
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,100
他们二人打着律师委托人保密协议的名号
The two of them concocted a story

525
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,090
合伙捏造事实
under the guise of attorney-client privilege,

526
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,430
而他们之所以能这么做是因为
which they were only able to do

527
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,320
斯佩克特先生既是他的老板又是他的律师
because Mr. Specter is both his boss and his attorney.

528
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,110
我给你那封信是真心诚意的
I gave you that letter in good faith.

529
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,130
你给我那封信明摆着是让我
You gave me that letter in a blatant attempt

530
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,650
撤销对你同伙的指控
to get me to drop charges against your co-conspirator.

531
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,040
这分明是恶意诽谤  我不能接受
That is slander and inadmissible.

532
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,740
够了  到我办公室来  十分钟
That's enough. My chambers--ten minutes.

533
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,500
-你把那封信给她了  -我是为了捞你出来
- You gave her that letter? - I did it to get you out.

534
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,060
要是这会让我们俩都折进去
I don't care about getting bail

535
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,440
我不在乎能不能保释
if it lands us both in prison.

536
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,800
不会让我们俩都折进去的
It's not gonna land us in prison,

537
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,120
而这封信早晚得浮出水面
and it would've come out anyway.

538
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,680
我们不可能销毁每一件证据
We can't just destroy every piece of evidence.

539
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,330
我们当然不能在证据上做手脚
Oh, we can't do anything with any piece of evidence

540
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,920
因为她就要把你踢出局了
because she's about to get you kicked off my case.

541
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,660
她没有理由把我踢出局
She has no grounds to kick me off.

542
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,040
那封信又不是我们合伙写的
We didn't conspire to write that letter.

543
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,520
但我们合谋干了别的事
But we conspired to do something else,

544
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,530
你可别忘了
in case you forgot.

545
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,800
那我们最好想出别的办法
Then we better come up with something,

546
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,560
还得尽快想出来
and we better come up with it fast.

547
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,030
我可没有罢免律师的习惯  吉布斯女士
I'm not in the habit of removing counsel, Ms. Gibbs.

548
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,040
我也没有在审判中让同谋
And I'm not in the habit of having an accomplice

549
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,380
当辩护律师的习惯
be the attorney on a case.

550
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,870
我有请律师的权利
I'm entitled to representation.

551
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,900
你昨晚就已经行使过了
And you had it last night.

552
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,860
你登记的辩护律师为罗伯特・赞恩
Your attorney of record is listed as Robert Zane.

553
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,000
你想把我踢出这个案子
The only reason you want me off this case

554
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,540
完全是因为你能逼迫罗伯特让我的委托人
is so you can pressure Robert into making my client

555
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,930
接受你的烂条件
take your bullshit offer.

556
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,690
我想把你踢出这个案子的原因
The reason I want you off this case

557
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,780
是因为你是未被起诉的同谋
is because you're an unindicted co-conspirator.

558
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,920
如果他是未被起诉的同谋  那你也是
If he's an unindicted co-conspirator, then so are you.

559
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,710
你说什么
Excuse me?

560
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,210
你在我委托人被捕当晚
You violated my client's rights

561
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,950
侵犯了他的权利  有录像为证
the night he was arrested, and we have it on tape.

562
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,020
那完全是一个骗子的谎言
That is a complete fabrication based on the word of a con man.

563
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,440
一个过目不忘的所谓骗子
An alleged con man with a photographic memory,

564
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,270
-法官大人  -跟什么记忆有什么关系
- Your Honor. - And what does that have to do with anything?

565
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,050
因为如果我是谎称有录像
Because if I'm lying about a digital tape,

566
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,210
那我怎么会记得
then how do I know the serial number

567
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,630
你在审讯时用的录像机的序列号
of the camera you use in your interrogation?

568
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,770
RKZ986532
RKZ986532.

569
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,520
电池用一小片蓝色胶带粘着
Little piece of blue tape keeping the battery attached.

570
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,030
你是想自己撤销动议
You want to remove your motion,

571
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,170
还是让我传票索要那段录像
or do I have to subpoena that camera?

572
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,700
我会撤销动议  法官大人
I'll withdraw my motion, Your Honor.

573
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,070
你可以走了  罗斯先生
You're free to go, Mr. Ross,

574
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,790
斯佩克特先生还是你的辩护律师
and Mr. Specter is your attorney.

575
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,250
这只会证明你俩是一伙的
All this proves is that you two were in on this together.

576
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,670
这证明了你会不惜一切去胜诉
What this proves is you'll do anything to win,

577
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,320
现在法官和我都知道这点了
and now the judge knows it, and so do I.

578
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,230
路易  手头的事都放下
Louis, put down whatever you're doing.

579
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,050
你需要什么
What do you need?

580
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,820
我要你确保
I need you to make sure

581
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,910
公司章程里没有能让杰克・索罗夫
there's nothing in the bylaws Jack Soloff can use

582
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,700
用来投票踢掉我的条款
to call for a vote and get me out.

583
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,010
我现在就能告诉你
Well, I can tell you right now,

584
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,440
两周内他什么都做不了
he can't do anything for two weeks,

585
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,230
但两周过后  我们就没法阻止他了
but after that, there's nothing we can do to stop him.

586
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,910
那你得想个备用计划
Then I need you to figure out a plan B,

587
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,600
因为两周后...
because in two weeks--

588
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,980
等等  哈维怎么没来
Wait a second. Why isn't Harvey here?

589
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,540
什么意思
What do you mean?

590
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,400
这不仅是我们的律所  也是他的
I mean it's his firm as much as ours.

591
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,830
这一切又是因他而起
He's the one who started this whole thing,

592
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,990
所以他没出现肯定有原因
so there must be a reason he's not here.

593
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,220
哈维在为迈克辩护
Harvey's working on Mike's defense.

594
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,390
见鬼  那会让我们显得有罪
Oh, god damn it, that makes us all look guilty

595
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,280
危及我们所有人  杰西卡
and puts us all in jeopardy, Jessica.

596
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,280
我一开始也是这个反应
That was my reaction too.

597
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,480
然后我意识到
And then I realized

598
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,280
当辩护律师能让我们和迈克交流
this allows us to communicate with Mike and each other,

599
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,350
而且内容全部保密
and it's all privileged.

600
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,570
那你要向我保证
Then I want it said right now--

601
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,900
别把唐娜牵扯进去
Donna stays out of it.

602
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,020
没问题
That's not gonna be a problem,

603
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,060
因为哈维已经不是这里的律师了
because Harvey doesn't work here anymore.

604
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,600
-什么  -他为了让傅滋曼罢手辞职了
- What? - He resigned to get Forstman to back off.

605
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,820
那让我猜猜
Well, then let me guess--

606
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,710
不能让检察官知道他辞职了
the prosecutor can't know he did that,

607
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,270
也不能让傅滋曼知道他还没辞职
and Forstman can't know he didn't.

608
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,120
-没错  -天啊  杰西卡
- Exactly. - Jesus Christ, Jessica.

609
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,720
如果哈维不在  我们在杰克面前
If Harvey's not here, that even makes us

610
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,120
就更无力了
more vulnerable to Jack.

611
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,140
所以我才需要你顶上
Which is why I need you to step up

612
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,240
找到方法阻止那个混蛋
and figure out a way to keep that son of a bitch

613
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,870
把我挤下台
from taking me out.

614
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,030
你没事吧
Are you okay?

615
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,470
现在没事了
I am now.

616
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,050
你出来了
You're out.

617
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,800
我也不打算再进去了
And I have no intention of ever going back in.

618
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,360
我们现在要怎么办
What are we gonna do now?

619
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,020
我来告诉你们要怎么办
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

620
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,300
我们要进攻了
We're gonna go on offense.

621
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,080
什么意思
What does that mean?

622
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,450
意思是要找出她知道些什么  怎么知道的
It means finding out what she knows and how she knows it.

623
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,170
我们要先找个地方
And it starts with us getting into a room,

624
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,840
列出所有知道真相的人
making a list of every goddamn person who knows the truth.

625
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,100
唐娜  你怎么在这儿
Donna, what are you doing in here?

626
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,700
我那边需要你
I need your help.

627
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,150
你的意思是"谢谢你加班  唐娜
Don't you mean, "Thanks for working late, Donna.

628
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,680
"我能求你帮点忙吗"吧
May I ask for you assistance with something?"

629
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,860
我的意思是杰克・索罗夫
No, I mean Jack Soloff

630
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,900
正踩着我们所有人往上爬呢  你得...
is crawling up our collective asses, and I need you to--

631
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,430
-那是什么  -私事
- What is that? - It's a private matter.

632
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,890
迈克・罗斯的雇佣记录
Mike Ross's employment records?

633
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,530
见鬼  唐娜
God damn it, Donna.

634
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,850
-你在帮哈维做事  -路易
- You're doing work for Harvey? - Louis--

635
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,610
我特地告诉你离迈克的案子远一点
I explicitly told you to stay away from Mike's case.

636
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,720
我听到了
And I heard you.

637
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,640
我就是不在乎
I just don't care.

638
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,310
-你说什么  -我说我不在乎
- What did you say to me? - I said I don't care.

639
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,430
我禁止你这么做
Well, I forbid you to do this.

640
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,560
什么
Excuse me?

641
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,710
唐娜  你好像没懂
Donna, I don't think you get it.

642
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,100
总有一天
There is going to come a time

643
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,260
你要在自己和他们之间
where you're gonna have to choose

644
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,000
做出选择
between yourself and them,

645
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,240
我不会让你为了他们俩中的任何一个
and I am not going to let you throw your life away

646
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,070
毁了自己
for either one of them.

647
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,930
你知道吗  路易
You know what, Louis?

648
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,010
要是他们想冲着我来  随他们来
If they're gonna come for me, they're gonna come for me.

649
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,940
但在那之前  如果迈克和哈维需要我
But until then, if Mike and Harvey need my help,

650
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,460
我就会帮忙
I'm gonna give it to them.

651
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,100
如果你受不了这一点
And if you have a problem with that,

652
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,460
你就炒了我吧
you might as well fire me.

653
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,630
罗伯特
Robert?

654
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,110
一开始瑞秋告诉我她不想为我工作的时候
When Rachel first told me she didn't want to work for me,

655
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,330
我们吵了一整晚
we fought all night.

656
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,240
我觉得没有律所能比得上我的律所
I didn't think any other firm was good enough.

657
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,340
然后她说要为你工作
And then she told me she was gonna work for you,

658
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,260
那改变了一切
and that changed everything.

659
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,960
一个卓越的黑人女性
A brilliant black woman,

660
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,630
做我女儿的导师
mentor for my baby girl,

661
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,820
一个能教她这个世界
someone who could teach her

662
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,840
会如何对待我们这种人的导师
what the world does to people like us--

663
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,570
教她如何在业内摸爬滚打
how to get down in the mud

664
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,430
却又不失尊严体面的导师
and still manage to keep her dignity.

665
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,080
可你看看你都教会了她什么
And look at what you taught her instead.

666
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,980
你就是来跟我说这些的吗
Is that what you came here to tell me?

667
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,970
我是来让你解雇瑞秋的
I came here to tell you to fire Rachel,

668
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,860
因为她不会主动辞职
because she won't quit.

669
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,650
等他们让他把黑锅甩给你的时候
And when they come at him to turn on you,

670
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,540
我得让她离这里远远的
I don't want her within 1,000 miles of this place.

671
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,580
抱歉  罗伯特
I'm sorry, Robert.

672
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,580
我做不到
I can't do that.

673
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,580
你清楚原因
And you know why.

674
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,820
我的确知道...
I do...

675
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,780
因为这让他看起来有罪...
Because it makes him look guilty...

676
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,520
而他已经有罪了
which he already is.

677
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,850
而且当他们让我去劝他告发你时
And when they ask me to help to get him to turn on you,

678
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,640
我也会极力推荐他这么做
I'm gonna recommend that he does.

679
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,000
你尽管做必须要做的事情
You do what you need to do,

680
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,190
而我也会做必须做的事来挽救我的律所
and I'll do what I need to do to save my firm.

681
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,650
你怎么做不重要
It doesn't matter what you do.

682
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,580
你的律所注定土崩瓦解
Your firm is gonna crumble all around you.

683
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,130
-你这是在威胁我吗  -我没必要威胁你
- Is that a threat? - I don't have to threaten you.

684
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,040
我连手指都不用抬一下
I don't have to lift a finger,

685
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,190
因为人们会从你
because people are gonna come at you

686
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,510
根本不知道的角落扑上来找你麻烦
from places you didn't even know existed,

687
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,590
而我会享受这过程的每一分每一秒
and I'm gonna enjoy every second of it.

688
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,760
路易  如果你要见我
Louis, if you wanted to see me,

689
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,800
没必要专门发短讯给我
you didn't have to send me a message

690
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,880
说你要在这里见我
telling me to meet you here.

691
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,820
我这么做是因为我有一个非常简单的
I did that because I have a foolproof plan

692
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,460
能让杰克还没开始就失败的计划
to stop Jack before he even gets started.

693
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,790
-那你说说看  -让我做管理合伙人
- Well, let's hear it. - Make me managing partner.

694
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,720
-再说一遍  -这是个完美的方法
- Come again? - It's the perfect solution.

695
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,900
我入接手  你身上的靶子就没了
I step in, target's off your back,

696
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,540
在事情过去前我们都能自保
and we're fine till this all blows over.

697
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,890
难以置信
I don't believe this.

698
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,960
你居然想要我的职位
You want my goddamn job.

699
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,300
什么  事情不是这样的
What? It's not like that.

700
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,580
没人会觉得我和迈克有牵连
No one thinks that I have anything to do with Mike.

701
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,250
我的品德无人非议
My ethics are beyond reproach.

702
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,240
我可不记得你的品德是无人非议的
I don't recall them being beyond reproach

703
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,820
想想你利用迈克的秘密让自己名字上墙的时候
when you used Mike's secret to get your name on the wall.

704
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,290
-杰西卡  那...  -路易
- Jessica, that... - Louis.

705
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,600
你只顾着自己
You are out for yourself,

706
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,530
我不会同意这事的
and I'm not going to stand for it.

707
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,940
你怎么可以对我说这话
How the hell could you say that to me

708
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,720
明明是你让我上位的
after you just told me to step up?

709
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,610
你若想帮忙
You want to step up,

710
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,770
就照我说的做  别再顶着
then do what I goddamn told you to do and don't come to me

711
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,290
迈克・罗斯的事"与我无关"的表情来找我
with some "I'm not part of this" Mike Ross bullshit ever again.

712
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,560
我还在想要多久你才会来找我
I was wondering how long it was going to take you.

713
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,630
-你听说了  -满城皆知
- You heard? - Everybody's heard.

714
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,250
斯科特  我有事问你
Scottie, I have something to ask you,

715
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,910
而这个问题会冒犯到你
and you're not gonna like what it is.

716
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,500
难以置信  你觉得是我干的吗
I can't believe it. You think I would do that?

717
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,250
不  我觉得你绝对不会这么做
No, I know you'd never do that.

718
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,200
那你来干吗
Then what are you doing here?

719
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,300
迈克觉得可能是你干的
Mike thought it could be you,

720
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,490
我向他保证会看着你的眼睛问这个问题
and I promised him I'd look you in the eye and ask.

721
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,210
好  那让我把话说清楚
Okay, so let me get this straight.

722
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,740
我保守了迈克的秘密  还为你弃了个案子
I keep Mike's secret, throw a case for you,

723
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,160
而你现在却听他的指令跑到我这
and now you're here taking orders from him

724
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,330
就因为你信不过我吗
because you don't trust me?

725
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,610
我信你  也和迈克这么说了
I do trust you, and I told Mike I did.

726
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,250
所以你来这儿的原因
Which is why the real reason you're here

727
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,060
不是问是不是我告的密
is not to ask me if I handed him in,

728
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,600
而是让我不要乱说
but to tell me to keep quiet.

729
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,960
不是强迫你...只是以防万一来请求你罢了
Not to tell you...to ask you if you're going to.

730
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,180
有区别吗
What is the difference?

731
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,490
-斯科特...  -哈维  你的生活与我无关
- Scottie... - Harvey, I am not in your life anymore.

732
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,910
你为什么觉得他们会找上我
I mean, what makes you think that they're going to come to me?

733
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,520
因为你也知道其中的流程啊
'Cause you know how this works.

734
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,860
他们会深挖我的私人生活
They're gonna dig into my personal life,

735
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,650
当他们这么做时  就会发现你
and when they do, they're gonna find you.

736
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,200
那有多少个女人像我这样值得你今天来拜访呢
And how many women like me are you paying a visit to today?

737
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,260
你是独一无二的  这点你知道的
There are no women like you, and you know that.

738
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,760
我只知道  上一次你来找我
What I know is, the last time you came to me,

739
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,020
我让你别再跟我提迈克・罗斯的名字
I told you I never wanted to hear Mike Ross's name again,

740
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,490
可又一次  你来我这  让我去为那个
and once again, here you are, asking me to do something

741
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,140
破坏我俩关系的人做事情
for the person that destroyed our relationship.

742
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,340
斯科特  我不是来跟你吵架的
Scottie, I'm not here to argue with you.

743
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,640
可你还是想知道我要怎么做吗
But you still want to know what I'm going to do?

744
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,020
我想
I do.

745
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,210
好  我想那要等他们来找我的时候
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to find that out

746
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,260
才知道答案了
when they come.

747
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,320
我得跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

748
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,220
关于婚礼的事情
Look, we've already discussed all there is

749
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,400
我们已经谈完了
to discuss about the wedding.

750
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,430
我没法去  除非你辞职...
I can't go, so unless you've quit...

751
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,910
我被捕了
I was arrested.

752
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,030
什么
What?

753
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,930
两天前的晚上  就在我办公室
Two nights ago, in my office,

754
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,430
两个美国法警毫无征兆地把我抓了
Two U.S Marshals grabbed me out of the blue.

755
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,140
-我很抱歉  -先留着你的抱歉
- I'm sorry. - You can save your sorrys.

756
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,800
我想知道是不是你告发的
I want to know if you're the one who turned me in.

757
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,660
什么
What?

758
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,700
天呐  你居然有这种想法
Jesus Christ, I can't believe you'd think that.

759
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,760
为什么不能有
Why wouldn't I?

760
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,690
这事你又不是没干过  你还告诉了沃克神父
You've done it before, and you also told Father Walker,

761
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,920
而且到现在我还没听到你说不是你干的
and I still haven't heard you say that it wasn't you.

762
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,000
好吧  不是我干的
Well, it wasn't me.

763
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,610
去沃克神父那儿只是为了让我的生活重回正轨
Going to Father Walker was about making things right in my life.

764
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,640
那行  我有办法让你和我一起回到正轨
Yeah, well, I got a way you can make things right with me.

765
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,300
他们会来找你
They're gonna come to you

766
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,540
以便立案起诉我
to put together a case against me,

767
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,340
我得知道你会怎么跟他们说
and I need to know what you're gonna say.

768
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,660
我也不知道我会说什么  迈克尔
I don't know what I'm gonna say, Michael.

769
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,110
你想帮我写好答案
Do you want to write down my answers for me

770
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,200
就像以前上课前那样吗
like you used to before class?

771
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,250
是啊  我想  而这次  答案会是
Yeah, I do. And this time, the answer's gonna be,

772
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,000
"我得先跟我的律师谈谈"
"I need to speak to my lawyer."

773
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,710
咱俩20年的交情就成了句"要律师"  是吗
20 years of friendship all comes down to "Lawyer up," Huh?

774
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,580
是啊  没错  这是你欠我的  特雷弗
Yeah, it does, and you owe me, Trevor.

775
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,070
我没法替你撒谎  迈克
I can't lie for you, Mike.

776
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,300
我不是在让你替我撒谎
I'm not asking you to lie for me.

777
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,520
我是在让你弥补我
I'm asking you to pay me back

778
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,420
弥补之前你好几次毁了我的生活
for every time in my life you have screwed me over.

779
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:50,790
好吧
Okay.

780
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,690
但我这样做不是为了弥补你
But I'm not doing this to make it up to you.

781
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,110
我这样做是为了确保我的家人
I'm doing this to make sure my family

782
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,990
不会被牵涉其中
doesn't get dragged into this.

783
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,580
别再为此事打扰我
So don't bother me with this again,

784
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,460
不然我可能会把我知道的对他们全盘托出
or I may just have to tell them everything I know.

785
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,700
看得出你出拳不错
I see you can dish it out.

786
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,750
问题是  你能扛得住别人打你一拳吗
The question is, can you take a punch?

787
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,800
不如你把拳套戴上吧
Why don't you put the gloves on?

788
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,510
打打就知道
We can find out.

789
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,490
不知道你注意到没
I don't know if you've noticed,

790
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,190
比赛早已开始  你我却不在一个重量级
but we're already in the ring, and you're not in my class.

791
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,220
你来这干吗
What are you doing here?

792
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,580
我只想看着你的眼睛
I just wanted to look you in the eye

793
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,620
问问你是否还在皮尔逊-斯佩克特-利特工作
and ask if you still work at Pearson Specter Litt.

794
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,720
你说什么
Excuse me?

795
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,550
我顺路去了你办公室一趟  看看你是否
I stopped by your office to see if you were serious

796
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,520
真的准备要帮他脱罪  可你不在那儿
about pleading this thing out, and you weren't there.

797
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,340
于是我问你秘书你什么时候回来
So I asked your secretary when you'd be coming back,

798
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,070
她却变得很警惕
and she got very cagey.

799
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,160
而我现在发现你大中午在这里打拳击
And now I find you here, boxing in the middle of the day.

800
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,930
我来这放松一下
I'm blowing off steam.

801
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,030
我可不这样觉得
I don't think so.

802
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,620
我想你和罗斯先生伪造辞职信的事了
I think I was wrong about you and Mr. Ross

803
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,880
是我误会了
fabricating a letter of resignation.

804
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,590
应该是杰西卡・皮尔逊
And I think Jessica Pearson

805
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,020
发现了你们要做什么
found out what you two were up to,

806
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,130
比起让她自己像傻子一样
and rather than making herself look like a fool

807
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,460
告发你们
by handing you in,

808
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,300
她逼迫你们双双辞职
She forced you both to resign.

809
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,200
现在你们只能靠自己了
And now you're on your own.

810
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,680
我觉得如果你想写小说
And I think if you want to write fiction,

811
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,120
我听说纽约大学有辅导班
I hear they got a remedial class at NYU.

812
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,130
或许我想错了
Maybe I'm wrong.

813
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,010
或许杰西卡一直知道迈克・罗斯的事
Maybe Jessica knew about Mike Ross all along,

814
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,610
这样的话  或许你该告发她
in which case, maybe you would turn on her.

815
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,310
你不如在我揍你之前
Why don't you get the hell out of here

816
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,760
离开这里
before I turn on you?

817
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,930
我会的
I will.

818
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,940
但如果我发现你辞职
But if I find out you resigned,

819
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,960
那就是你合谋的证据
that's evidence you're a co-conspirator.

820
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,290
我不仅会让你打不了辩护
And I'll not only get you off this case.

821
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,020
还会把你和你的小宠物一起关进监狱去
I'll put you behind bars along with your little pet.

822
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,570
这是什么
What the hell is this?

823
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,170
你知道是什么  是正式通知
You know what it is. It's formal notice.

824
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,130
我不需要你的服务了
Your services are no longer required.

825
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,740
我不相信
I don't believe this.

826
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,320
-你要解雇我  -是的
- You're firing me? - Yes, I am.

827
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,870
而且我希望你今晚就收拾东西
And I want you to pack your things up tonight,

828
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,260
因为我们在事情轻重缓急上意见相左
because you and I don't see eye to eye on your priorities.

829
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,560
好  路易
Okay, Louis...

830
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,330
只因为我们吵了一架
Just because we had a fight--

831
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,910
不  这跟那个没关系
No, this has nothing to do with that.

832
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,660
你是说这跟你因为之前的争吵
So you're saying that this has nothing to do

833
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,650
而冲我发火
with you lashing out at me

834
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,110
完全没有关系
because of the fight we had before?

835
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,240
对  没有  因为在其他事上
No, it doesn't, because among other things,

836
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,650
你自己安排时间  不听命令
you set your own hours, you can't take dictation,

837
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,660
最重要的是  你根本不懂识人
and to top all that, you can't read people for shit!

838
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,580
到底怎么了
What's going on?

839
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,840
曾经你因为帮助他们而差点进了监狱
You almost went to jail for helping them once before,

840
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,590
我不能接受那个
and I couldn't take that.

841
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,500
一想到我会再次失去你...
And the thought of losing you once again...

842
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,010
所以你知道他们需要我帮助
So you know that they need my help.

843
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:35,840
对
Yeah.

844
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,270
我知道
I do.

845
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,960
你现在可以走了
Now you're free to go.

846
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,410
你为什么会改变心意
What made you change your mind?

847
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,280
杰西卡说我不懂团队合作
Jessica accused me of not being a team player.

848
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,260
她说错了  而且...
And she was wrong about me, and...

849
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,640
我也看错你了
I was wrong about you.

850
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,110
谢谢  路易
Thank you, Louis.

851
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,850
我得走了
I have to go.

852
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,210
不  路易
No, Louis.

853
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,660
还不能
You don't.

854
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,770
你们在做什么
What are you doing here?

855
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,920
我们那天聊到一半被打断了
Our conversation got cut short the other night.

856
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,580
安妮塔・吉布斯让你来告诉我
So Anita Gibbs sent you here to tell me

857
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,400
我要进了监狱  就不可能好好出来
that if I go to prison, I'm not gonna come out the same.

858
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,460
没错  是的
You're right. She did.

859
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,630
她想让我来吓住你
She wanted me to come here and scare the shit out of you,

860
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,250
告诉你在里面
tell you about everything

861
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,140
会发生的事情
that's gonna be happening to you inside.

862
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,980
谁说我会进去的
And who says I'm ever gonna be inside?

863
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,400
也许不会
Maybe you won't.

864
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,290
但只要你进去  我来告诉你
But if you do, I'm here to tell you

865
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,200
外面会发生什么
everything that's gonna happen on the outside.

866
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,230
你干嘛不赶紧滚
Why don't you get the hell out of here?

867
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,610
听我说  安妮塔会来找你谈协议
Listen to me. Anita's going to come to you with a deal,

868
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,650
而协议不会经过哈维・斯佩克特传达
and it's not gonna be through Harvey Specter.

869
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,400
如果你够聪明  接受它
And if you're smart, you'll take it.

870
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,500
我说滚
I said get the hell out.

871
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,990
好吧  我走  只是告诉你点事
All right, I'll go. Just let me tell you something.

872
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,420
联邦监狱没有夫妻探视权
They don't have conjugal visits in federal prison.

873
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,230
即使他们有  我也见过你未婚妻
And even if they did, I've seen your fiancée.

874
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,760
她很聪明  很漂亮
She's smart. She's beautiful.

875
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,280
她有未来
She has a future.

876
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,230
那样的姑娘不会等你
Girls like that don't wait around,

877
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,670
不管她们怎么说
no matter what they say.

878
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,800
-有...  -我想谈谈...
- There's-- - I wanted to talk--

879
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,020
抱歉  你先说
Sorry. You go first.

880
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,320
我爸爸来过
My father was here.

881
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,930
那个女人找过他  谈协议
That woman went to him and offered a deal.

882
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
我猜...
Let me guess...

883
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,380
他们想让我告发哈维
They want me to turn on Harvey.

884
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,100
他们会撤销所有指控
They'll drop all the charges,

885
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,520
你一分钟监狱都不用进
and you won't have to spend a minute in prison.

886
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,910
你怎么跟他说的
What did you tell him?

887
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,440
我说我会把消息告诉你
I told him that I would give you the message.

888
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,290
你会告诉我
That you'd give me the message?

889
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,870
瑞秋  你知道我不可能
Rachel, you know there's no way in hell

890
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,530
绝对不可能告发他  对吗
I am ever gonna turn on them, right?

891
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,860
-你知道的  -是的
- You know that. - Yes, I do.

892
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,470
-是吗  -那应该是什么意思
- Do you? - What's that supposed to mean?

893
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,670
意思是你应该告诉他
It means that you should have told him

894
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,150
我忠于我生命中的每个人
that I'm loyal to everyone in my life,

895
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,770
我宁愿进监狱  也不会背叛他们
and I would rather go to jail than betray them.

896
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,660
我告诉他了
I did tell him that.

897
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,230
那你为什么不跟我说你告诉了
So then why didn't you tell me that you told him that?

898
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,500
因为你没问我
Because that's not what you asked me.

899
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,710
现在告诉我你从没考虑过
Tell me right now that the idea never crossed your mind

900
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,170
我应该接受协议
that I should take this deal.

901
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,460
我当然有过那样的主意
Of course it popped into my head for a second--

902
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,380
所以你觉得事情一出
So you think that I should just turn on them

903
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,700
我就该立刻背叛他们
the second things look bad?

904
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,800
我没那么说
That is not what I said.

905
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,620
你对我也会那样吗
Is that what you're thinking of doing to me?

906
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,550
你怎么这么问
How could you even ask me that?

907
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,130
我从没想过
I never even thought for a second

908
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,160
你甚至会考虑背叛哈维
that you would even consider an idea so disgusting

909
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,210
那么恶心的想法
as turning on Harvey.

910
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,650
唯一能让我考虑它的原因就是
The only reason I thought about it

911
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,910
因为我害怕你会进监狱
is because I am scared to death

912
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,020
怕得要死
of you going to prison.

913
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,080
是害怕我进监狱
Scared of me going to prison

914
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,050
还是害怕你没法坚持等我
or scared that you can't stick around?

915
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,180
你...
Are you...

916
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,380
迈克  不要
Mike, don't.

917
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,730
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

918
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,590
我们有麻烦了
We got a problem.

919
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,340
没错
Yeah, we do...

920
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,140
告密的不是特雷弗
'cause it wasn't Trevor.

921
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,020
也不是斯科特  但那不是问题所在
It wasn't Scottie either, but that's not our problem.

922
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,680
吉布斯今天来找我  她知道我不在律所
Gibbs came to see me earlier. She knows I'm not in the office.

923
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,650
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

924
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,610
意思是她会用那点做证据
It means she's gonna try to use it as evidence

925
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,270
证明哈维是同谋
of Harvey being a co-conspirator,

926
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,160
如果她那么做了  哈维就不能给我辩护了
and if she does that, Harvey can't represent me.

927
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,920
发生了什么
What's going on?

928
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,200
他们给迈克提供了一个协议
They offered Mike a deal.

929
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,410
他们希望他告发你
They want him to turn on you.

930
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,560
那你真是有伴了
Then you're in good company,

931
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,780
因为他们要我告发杰西卡
'cause they offered me a deal to turn on Jessica,

932
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,820
但那也不成问题
but that's not our problem.

933
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,350
我们的问题是得想办法让我回去
Our problem is figuring out how to get me back

934
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,360
而且还不能让傅滋曼知道
without Forstman finding out.

935
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,270
等一下
Wait a second.

936
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,060
傅滋曼知不知道不重要
It doesn't matter if Forstman finds out or not

937
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,540
只要内部没人为他做事就行了
if he doesn't have someone on the inside working for him.

938
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,090
你在说什么
What are you saying?

939
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,960
我是说如果他们想让我
I'm saying that if they want me

940
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,560
去指认某个人
to point the finger at someone,

941
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,530
那就意味着我手里有枪
that means I'm holding a gun.

942
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,640
它还活着呢
It's still alive.

943
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,770
你以为我会让它死掉吗
Did you think I would let it die?

944
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,710
没  但我以为你会把它送人
No, but I thought you might give it away.

945
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,200
我比你想象中要感性
Well, I'm more sentimental than you think.

946
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,280
你怎么进来的
How'd you get in here?

947
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,180
杰西卡告诉我的
Jessica told me how

948
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,080
在我跟她说了我进来要干嘛之后
when I told her what I was coming here to do.

949
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,250
那你进来要干嘛
And what is that?

950
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,220
你需要我...
You need me...

951
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,800
因为就算格雷琴很厉害  她也不能参与这事
because as good as Gretchen is, she can't be a part of this,

952
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,950
你很清楚
and you know it.

953
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,110
你是说你要回来为我工作
You're saying you're coming back to me?

954
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,410
是的
Yes.

955
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,650
我愿意
I am.

956
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:28,850
很好
Good.

957
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,660
很好
Good.

958
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
那我们明早办公室见
Then we'll see you back in the office tomorrow.

959
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,890
-什么意思  -意思是我要回来
- What do you mean? - I mean I'm coming back.

960
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,320
你怎么做到的
How did you swing that?

961
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,460
还没搞定  但我有个秘密武器
Hasn't happened yet, but I got a little secret weapon

962
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,990
叫迈克・罗斯
called Mike Ross.

963
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,720
那么...
Well, then...

964
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,160
明天见
see you tomorrow.

965
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,840
唐娜
Donna?

966
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,210
路易什么反应
How did Louis take it?

967
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,730
不管你信不信  这是他的主意
Believe it or not, it was his idea.

968
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,910
看到我很惊讶吗
Surprised to see me?

969
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,410
说实话  是的
As a matter of fact, I am,

970
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,490
不过既然你来了  我有事问你
but as long as you're here, I have a question for you.

971
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,310
你想知道是不是真的
You want to know if it's true.

972
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,920
我知道是真的
Oh, I know it's true.

973
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,640
我想知道你为什么没有尝试
I want to know why you haven't tried

974
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,980
达成协议脱离这个境地
to deal your way out of this.

975
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,360
你是问我为什么没有背叛哈维和杰西卡吗
You mean why haven't I turned on Harvey and Jessica?

976
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,840
就是这个意思
That's exactly what I mean.

977
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:33,820
这跟你想利用这事
It wouldn't have anything to do

978
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,800
把自己名字贴这门上[成为管理合伙人]
with you wanting to use all of this

979
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,690
没有关系  是吗
just to get your name on the door, would it?

980
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,930
不管你接不接受协议
Oh, I'm getting my name on the door

981
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,440
我都能把名字贴门上
whether you cut a deal or not.

982
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,420
如果你不停止找哈维和杰西卡的麻烦
Well, if you don't stop coming after Harvey and Jessica,

983
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,890
那你能看的门
the only door you're gonna be looking at

984
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,130
就只有带监狱围栏的了
is gonna have bars on it.

985
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,650
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

986
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,160
我来告诉你
Let me tell you

987
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,460
我刚刚告诉了丹尼尔・哈德曼的事
what I just got finished telling Daniel Hardman.

988
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,260
他们正要来抓我
They're coming at me left and right

989
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,580
让我承认这里有人
to admit that someone around here knew

990
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,010
一直都知道我的事
what was going on with me the whole time.

991
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,690
如果你不对这间律所
So, if you don't back off

992
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,360
彻底收手的话
trying to take over this firm once and for all,

993
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,460
我就告诉他们  那个人就是你
I'm gonna tell them that someone was you.

994
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,470
胡说
Bullshit.

995
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,460
你几个月前才刚认识的我
You didn't even know me until a few months ago.

996
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,010
对啊  但之后我们一起工作
Well, yeah, but then you and I worked together

997
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,000
办一个案子  关系那么密切
so closely on that case.

998
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,130
我就告诉你了
And then I confided in you.

999
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:14,810
之后你让我当上合伙人
And then you made me partner

1000
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,520
让你自己有个盟友
so that you would always have an ally.

1001
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,060
这种事在法庭上根本站不住脚
There's no way that holds up in court.

1002
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,920
那你去跟法官说吧  祝你好运
Good luck telling that to the judge.

1003
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,350
这个检察官
And this prosecutor...

1004
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,840
她真的是变态
she--she's a real beast.

1005
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,750
她会用尽一切手段追查你
She's gonna come after you with everything she has.

1006
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,630
我没招惹你
I never did anything to you.

1007
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,300
我也不会离开我的律所
And I'm not leaving my firm.

1008
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,350
我不在乎你是去是留
I don't give a shit whether you stay or you go.

1009
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,770
但明天哈维会回来
But Harvey is coming back here tomorrow morning,

1010
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:42,660
如果你告诉了查尔斯・傅滋曼
and if you pick up that phone and call Charles forstman,

1011
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,890
我就去找检察官
then I am gonna pick up the phone

1012
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,070
说你和我的事
and tell that prosecutor all about me and you.

1013
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,910
我一直好奇在这里是什么样
I always wondered what it was like in here.

1014
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,250
比我想象得还好
It's nicer than I thought.

1015
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,760
杰西卡  你怎么找到我的
Jessica, how'd you find me here?

1016
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,860
你难过时总会做泥浴
You always go mudding when you're upset.

1017
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,420
我还去射击场  还有看芭蕾
I also go to the gun range and the ballet.

1018
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,550
你生气时去射击场
You go to the range when you're angry,

1019
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,410
沮丧时去看芭蕾
the ballet when you're depressed,

1020
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,610
但泥浴...
but mud...

1021
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:14,040
能抚慰受伤的心
Heals the broken heart.

1022
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,400
我知道
I know.

1023
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,330
我听说了你和唐娜的事
And I heard about what you did with Donna.

1024
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,570
我是来说对不起的
And I'm here to say I'm sorry.

1025
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,320
你不是只在乎自己
You weren't just out for yourself.

1026
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,110
但我是只在乎自己
But I was out for myself, Jessica.

1027
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,220
唐娜让我看到的
Donna showed me that.

1028
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,710
你是说你真的想抢我的工作吗
Are you saying you were after my job?

1029
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,000
当然不是
Of course I wasn't.

1030
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,080
但我他妈是在骗谁啊
But who the hell am I kidding, you know?

1031
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,600
我不是弗罗多[《魔戒》主角]
I mean, I'm not Frodo.

1032
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,990
一旦我获得戒指的力量
Once I got that ring of power,

1033
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,780
我们都知道它会消耗我
We all know it would've consumed me.

1034
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,450
我就是喜欢你这点  路易
That's what I like about you, Louis.

1035
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,790
你也许没有自知之明
You may not be self-aware,

1036
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,490
但只要有人举起镜子
but if someone holds up a mirror,

1037
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,740
你就不怕去照见自己
you are not afraid to look.

1038
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,000
谢谢你  杰西卡
Thank you, Jessica.

1039
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,280
事实是
And the truth is,

1040
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,760
比起我  哈维更需要唐娜
Harvey needs Donna more than I do.

1041
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,840
那是无私又高尚的举动
Well, it was a selfless and noble act.

1042
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,860
而在我看来  你或许不是弗罗多
And as far as I'm concerned, you may not be Frodo,

1043
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,880
但你是山姆怀斯・甘姆齐[弗罗多的随从]
but you are Samwise Gamgee.

1044
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,580
你...你看过《魔戒》
Get the f-- you read "Lord of the rings"?

1045
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,870
四遍
Four times.

1046
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,400
那书是讲权力的
I mean, it is about power.

1047
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,010
真有意思
That's funny.

1048
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,640
我一直觉得是关于友谊的呢
I always thought it was about friendship.

1049
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,970
晚安  路易
Good night, Louis.

1050
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,790
你确定不来个快速泥浴吗
You sure you don't want to have a quick mud?

1051
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,100
或许下次吧
Maybe next time.

1052
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,570
-真的吗  -假的
- Really? - No.

1053
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,590
结果如何
How'd it go?

1054
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,780
应该说杰克・索罗夫不成问题了
Let's just say Jack Soloff's not gonna be a problem anymore.

1055
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,470
搞定一件事
That's one thing down.

1056
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,500
是啊
Yeah, it is.

1057
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,880
-瑞秋  -我不会离开你的
- Look, Rachel-- - I'm not gonna leave you.

1058
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,810
你怎么知道
How can you know that?

1059
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,810
我能说的只是我们一认识
All I can tell you is that we've managed

1060
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:51,100
这事就悬在我们头上
to stay together with this thing hanging over our heads

1061
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,110
但我们都想办法好好在一起了
for as long as we've known each other.

1062
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,860
如果我们能撑过那一段  我们就能撑过这事
And if we can get through that, we can get through this.

1063
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,680
但我还是可能进监狱
But I still might go to jail.

1064
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:08,250
如果你进去  你会出来
And if you do, you'll get out...

1065
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,260
而我会等你
and I'll be there.

1066
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,480
而且那件事也不会再继续悬在我们头顶了...
And it won't be hanging over our heads...

1067
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,720
再也不会了
ever again.
